1/31/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: okay, I was just making sure, because the note was a bit unclear
1/31/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: you might want to improve clearity there
1/31/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Why is N 1?
1/31/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's a 2's complement binary number
1/31/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And the first number is a 1
1/31/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: because the left most digits in the carry are the same
1/31/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So that means it's a negative number
1/31/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: oh nvm, that's V
1/31/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: With me it isn't
1/31/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: it's a negative number, because the result is has a 1 at the front
1/31/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: One 0 to much in the begin
1/31/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: uhm
1/31/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: calculation
1/31/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: But that's my result
1/31/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: what is 0 + 1+ 0 + 0
1/31/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Your result is wrong
1/31/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's an 8 bit number eh
1/31/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Wait, i'll do it again
1/31/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Oh yeah
1/31/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: My bad
1/31/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Np that's what we're here for ;)
1/31/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: Hate it that they don't give answer sheets...
1/31/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I have the same, was just gonna ask if it was correct
1/31/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: this is mine, min and maxterms
1/31/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 16:02 - Bart van Dooren: almost sure that one is correct joost
1/31/17, 16:02 - Bart van Dooren: idk about the circuit wait :P
1/31/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: nice, at least I have some points then
1/31/17, 16:03 - Bart van Dooren: circuit seems fine aswell
1/31/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 16:13 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: yes, this is what i have as well :))
1/31/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it confused me for a sec since we normally only need 4 states. thanks ^^
1/31/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: Why do you set the ALU in step 3? You don't pass the ALU?
1/31/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: so we know something about the value we write into the RAM
1/31/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: we only give the ALU an input enable so we can still get a signal from the bus
1/31/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: because the store function sets the flags Z, N, V for some reason. hence you should explicitly mention it somewhere
1/31/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: Ah that sounds logical, but how does the RA reach W then after it passed the ALU?
1/31/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: Like what you mean with input enable? Is the signal then still at the ABus after it passed the ALU
1/31/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: there is a direct connection via abus?
1/31/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: But I mean the signal from the ABus has to pass the ALU to set the flags, but does it get to W after it has passed the ALU
1/31/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: something tells the ALU that it can read things from a specific bus
1/31/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it does not overwrite anything on that bus
1/31/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its not like the signal only goes left or right
1/31/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: think of it like this
1/31/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: if you connect a cable thats "onder stroom" to an iron bar
1/31/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then its not gonna be like all current goes right or all current goes left
1/31/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: it goes both ways
1/31/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: the whole bar will be loaded
1/31/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: basically the same with the bus
1/31/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: thats why you can only send 1 signal on it each clock tick
1/31/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: bc otherwhise youd be fucking up everything
1/31/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: Ah I see now! Thanks guys
1/31/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: np
1/31/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Does anyone know if we get the "bijlage" with the PP2 instruction set during the test tomorrow?
1/31/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: Im gonna print it myself just in case
1/31/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: since its a bijlage it should be provided
1/31/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but idk
1/31/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: it still is jan friso
1/31/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so better be safe then sorry i guess?
1/31/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Only 2013 had it on oase
1/31/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Nvm it's more like universal
1/31/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: It says it will be available during the exam
1/31/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: So that answers my question I suppose
1/31/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I'm pretty sure we get one
1/31/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah
1/31/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Thank God
1/31/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Hey guys in the java code translation what code corresponds to returning c ?
1/31/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: RTS ?
1/31/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: if you say that the value is returned/stored/'passed' in a specific register it's probably fine
1/31/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: So if I put c in R1 for instance
1/31/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: What would it look like ?
1/31/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can someone explain how to do 3a of 27 januari 2016 exam?
1/31/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: @31630851426
1/31/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ahhh ok 👌🏻 thx
1/31/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: anyone who is 100% sure about his/her answer to the pc power switch question's state machine?
1/31/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: because I have trouble figuring out a good state machine for it
1/31/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can you get a clearer shot? I can't really read it
1/31/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: lemme rewrite it x)
1/31/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and maybe in such a way I don't need to have a head in 90°
1/31/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you can turn it in whatsapp
1/31/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: also on pc?
1/31/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: dunno I usually dont use web whatsapp
1/31/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thanks anyway
1/31/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: there are more solutions/attempts in the drive
1/31/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: why do you put the p' from B to A, and not to D?
1/31/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ah, I thought that was a new state
1/31/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: with the power off too
1/31/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I had to reread the story at least 100000 times as well. it's super vague/uncleae
1/31/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: All these exercises where you have to design an automaton are vague/unclear.
1/31/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: and Im still unsure if its the correct solutiom because of that
1/31/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, but it's still more clear than my solution, and it makes more sense
1/31/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so it's a better solution than mine
1/31/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: is the /off/ arrow also needed from A to D?
1/31/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: yup. but this one was *extra* vague, since the story is twice as long as the others :p
1/31/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I didn't see it in the text
1/31/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: or at least, not in the last bit
1/31/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: read the line in the prev pic after the highlighted one
1/31/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it should be shut down somehow by the processor, and the only thing that can do that is 'off'
1/31/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I see
1/31/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thanks
1/31/17, 17:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Do we get any formulas and rules for cs
1/31/17, 17:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I read somewhere that we get the assembly pp2 page
1/31/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: np ^^
1/31/17, 17:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Or something
1/31/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: we do dimitar
1/31/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: we get a document with all these things
1/31/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: but Im gonna print it myself just in case
1/31/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: this one
1/31/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: at least, I hope we get it with it
1/31/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: yes we get it
1/31/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: its stated in the studyguide
1/31/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You can do whatever you want
1/31/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: atleast if they don't ask for the most optimal way
1/31/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: but I don't think they ever ask for that
1/31/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: oVerflow
1/31/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: 0, two leftmost carry bits are equal
1/31/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: And is the carry bit that 1 left in the most left one
1/31/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: See how logical that is
1/31/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: nick, I meant it as in the same circuit
1/31/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Wht is a carry bit
1/31/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: my maxterm of Snew is shortest, and my minterm of Tnew is shortest, so I thought I can combine them in one circuit, but wasn't sure about it
1/31/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Joost you're at the exercise with the edge triggered d flip flops right?

1/31/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oh are there answers
1/31/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: To april 2013

Some answers are uploaded
1/31/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Okay thanks
1/31/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Keep in mind they are made by us
1/31/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: SO might not be 100% correct
1/31/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah Joost check out the answers
1/31/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: the only answer to 3c is from Ruben, and he only showed the circuit
1/31/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: and if you still don't understand I'll try to explain
1/31/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oki
1/31/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I was just wondering if I can use both of them in one circuit(maxterms to calculate the Snew, and minterms to calculate the Tnew), but I wasn't sure if I can use both of them in one circuit, or that it is required to only use minterms, or only use maxterms when creating a circuit
1/31/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: it's not exactly for this question only, but more of a general quesiton
1/31/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: AFAIK you can use minterms for Snew and maxterms for Tnew
1/31/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Or max for Snew and min for Tnew
1/31/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah you just need an expression for your snew and tnew
1/31/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: doesn't really matter if it's max or min
1/31/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ah, okay
1/31/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: that's the only thing I was wondering about
1/31/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Ahh okay
1/31/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Both are from exam 27 jan 2016
1/31/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: in some cases you could use X
1/31/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but its not wrong the way you do it
1/31/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and for the rest it looks fine
1/31/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, I realized I could use X to shorten the table, once I had already made the entire thing
1/31/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: aight
1/31/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: like at the start
1/31/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: well apart from that it looks fine
1/31/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: or at the end
1/31/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: nice :D
1/31/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and i suppose you havent fucked up ur min and max terms
1/31/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so yeah
1/31/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then you should be fine
1/31/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I sure hope so too
1/31/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for all these types of questions, how many points do you think we'll get by writing down the instruction fetch correctly?
1/31/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: In this case, the question was worth 8 points
1/31/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So I guess 1
1/31/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: But in other exams that questions is worth 16 points
1/31/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So it'll be more there
1/31/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, but in some cases it's just a load R1 ram[r1 + r2] for 16 points
1/31/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so I'm not even sure how many points you can get for that
1/31/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: In one exam the question literally is RR <- RA + RB
1/31/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: For 12 points
1/31/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So yeah
1/31/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and are we required to put comments and line numbers behind and in front of them?
1/31/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Comments never hurt, line numbers are required
1/31/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but they won't deduct points if you don't put comments there
1/31/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I was wondering why you do the SUB R4 R3 and then CMP R4 0? won't it always be negative then?
1/31/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: CMP R4 0 gives the same Negative flag result as SUB R4 R3, so it's a bit redundant. 

Doesn't the line LOAD R3 [R0] already set the negative flag if the content of R3 is negative?
1/31/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: SUB R4 R3, if R3 is negative R4 should be positive
1/31/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: As 0 - -1 = 1
1/31/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Don't know why I didn't use a jump if N=1 though
1/31/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Didn't think of it when I made that excercise I gues
1/31/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: guess*
1/31/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 18:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: guys is there a difference in twos complements of 19 and -19
1/31/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Where can I study b ?
1/31/17, 18:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: we get -19 twos comp by getting binary of 19 then flipping it and adding one
1/31/17, 18:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: how do we get 19 twos comp
1/31/17, 18:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: binary flip to get ones comp
1/31/17, 18:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and add one ?
1/31/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: just 19 in binary
1/31/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 18:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: does that mean they are the same ?
1/31/17, 18:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: just 19 in binary ?
1/31/17, 18:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: why ?
1/31/17, 18:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and yes johan I know this example it shows how to do negative ones
1/31/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: 8-bit two's complement 19 is just 19 in binary
1/31/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Or do you mean, you get a two's complement negative binary number
1/31/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: And have to convert it to a positive decimal number?
1/31/17, 18:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I am asking about twos complement of 19
1/31/17, 18:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: is it a rule or something ?
1/31/17, 18:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: that complement of positive is just number ?
1/31/17, 18:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I don't get it
1/31/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Two's complement 19 =  00010011
1/31/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: (In 8 bits)
1/31/17, 18:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes ok but why ?
1/31/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Just 'normal' 19 in binary, because two's complement does not change anything about positive numbers
1/31/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: That is 19 in binary
1/31/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: When you filp and add 1
1/31/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: You dont geet the same value tho
1/31/17, 18:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so tows complement doesn't do anything for positive
1/31/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Indeed
1/31/17, 18:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: only negative ?
1/31/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If you convert it to negative, change the 1's to 0's and vice-versa
1/31/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: And add 1
1/31/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: (Like that example I sent earlier)
1/31/17, 18:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what about 1 comp ?
1/31/17, 18:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: does it differ for positive and negative ?
1/31/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: One comp does not change positive numbers,
1/31/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If you flip 1's and 0's
1/31/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You get the negative number
1/31/17, 18:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: do ANY comp change anything for positive numbers
1/31/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Downside of one's compliment is that there are two values for 0
1/31/17, 18:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: or is it just the number in bunary
1/31/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: no
1/31/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yes
1/31/17, 18:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :|
1/31/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: haha
1/31/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: its just the number in binary and negative depends
1/31/17, 18:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: most useless thing in the world for positive don't even get why they ask about that
1/31/17, 18:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ok many thanks friend if friends
1/31/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: easy points

1/31/17, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: why is it R3-3 over here?
1/31/17, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: assuming the stack pointer points to the first free place, I would say it's R2-2
1/31/17, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: In this example they reserve 1 free place for the return value

1/31/17, 18:50 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The writer
1/31/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: oki thanks

1/31/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: No
1/31/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But they are both right?
1/31/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You can use them in your max/minterm selections
1/31/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: But they don't HAVE to be covered
1/31/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: depends on your truth table
1/31/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: As they don't care
1/31/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hmm okay, you 100% sure?
1/31/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: 97.5%
1/31/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Alright ty mate
1/31/17, 19:03 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I can add that 2.5%
1/31/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: you, I can trust
1/31/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: you are expected to use them when they create a nice line or square
1/31/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 😂
1/31/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: otherwise you can leave them
1/31/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: good
1/31/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: For STORE Ra [[Rb]] (exercise 4, apr2016), what is a good way to set the CC flags? It seems very redundant to take the value of Ra through the ALU before storing it in memory
1/31/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think if you set the ALU.op correctly and put a value on one of the buses, you can ignore the ALU's output but still store the CC flags
1/31/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Okay, that could work, thanks!
1/31/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: No problem
1/31/17, 19:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 19:38 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yup
1/31/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Nice
1/31/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What if they ask the extended data path @our exam??
1/31/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Then they fucked us real hard
1/31/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah like real hard
1/31/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Like black stick of jan Friso NP-hard
1/31/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That hard yea
1/31/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yes, because that would be the disjunctive normal form
1/31/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Conjunctive normal form is maxterms
1/31/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i see
1/31/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i thought it was the other way rounnd
1/31/17, 19:55 - Bart van Dooren: Is oase offline?
1/31/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: would make a lot more sense if it was the other way round but okay
1/31/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Could be, John couldnt login
1/31/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Tobin if you take minterms you do (a^b)v(a^c) etc right?
1/31/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: The v, the disjunction, is the primary gate
1/31/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I can login
1/31/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And load
1/31/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Minterms are a disjunction of several conjunctions
1/31/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Although logging in seems to take a long time
1/31/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And such the disjunctive normal form is with minterms
1/31/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Conjunctive normal form is the opposite, a conjunction of several disjunctions
1/31/17, 20:00 - Bart van Dooren: we just have to go to pav? i suggest @31643222030  because can't see it in oase can't login hehe
1/31/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I couldnt log in with my "normal" browser, but it worked when I logged in with a private window
1/31/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You can optimise it a little more
1/31/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: By making a square from the bottom outer right to the bottom outer left
1/31/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: Ah i see
1/31/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Instead of just a 2*1 in the bottom left
1/31/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: But still use the 2*1 from bottom left to top left right?
1/31/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yeah
1/31/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: Aight thanks
1/31/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: 1-2-2017 09:00 - 12:00 paviljoen study hub 2 vak e - paviljoen study hub 2 vak a - paviljoen study hub 2 vak b - paviljoen study hub 2 vak c - paviljoen study hub 2 vak d - paviljoen study hub 2 vak f
1/31/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Its completely correct except for that little optimisation
1/31/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Software Science
1/31/17, 20:06 - Bart van Dooren: thanks :D @31647311973
1/31/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: We can use R0 to R5?
1/31/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yes
1/31/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What was R6 again?
1/31/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You can also use 6 and 7 But i wouldnt recommend that
1/31/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Global base
1/31/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Place Where global variables are stored
1/31/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Mmkay, do we ever need that? Because for jumps we sometimes need R7
1/31/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yes you do
1/31/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: For instance If you have the variable a, when you wanna load var a to say R0 you can do LOAD R0 [GB + a]
1/31/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Which means that you dont have to fill a second register just to do that action
1/31/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah but never use R6 itself I mean
1/31/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If you follow me
1/31/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No true
1/31/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Just dont mess with R6 and ull be Good i suppose
1/31/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You can say @DATA a DS 1, then later load and stor things in [GB+a] you mean?
1/31/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No Thats not What i meant hihi
1/31/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You can For instance load a variable a to [GB + a]
1/31/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And later on If you need a just use that
1/31/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Instead of putting a in a register
1/31/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah but you first need to free up some space  right
1/31/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Bc sometimes you Will run out of registers
1/31/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Because you might fuck up the global base
1/31/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nah fuck the global base's space
1/31/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 😂
1/31/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Thats unlimited For you my friend
1/31/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thats what I meant with the @DATA shit
1/31/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: For free?
1/31/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: For me?
1/31/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I only know the things necessary For the ex of the exam
1/31/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Special price?
1/31/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So Idk anything about the @DATA stuff
1/31/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You just free up some space by before the code in the @DATA part say "variable DS 1" then in your code you can say STOR R0 [GB+ variable]
1/31/17, 20:33 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: How would you do the JSR instruction on the data path, is there an SP I am missing somewhere?
1/31/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 18545037‬: SP is stored in R7 I believe
1/31/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Oh of course
1/31/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: I'm stupid, thanks max 😘
1/31/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 18545037‬: No problem
1/31/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: For cs do they expect us to optimize the min- and maxterms if you have picked the optimal karnaugh diagram blocks?
1/31/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 18545037‬: No, at least not in the answer sheet from jan 2013
1/31/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Tim that totally depends on What you call optimal
1/31/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If its minimal amount of gates Then a lot can be optimized
1/31/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Not if they ask for the optimal 2-lvl implementation
1/31/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ah
1/31/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Then its just What you get from the karnaugh
1/31/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yep
1/31/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: When can overflows occur?
1/31/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: With everything that is calculations?
1/31/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: Ah that's nice to hear
1/31/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's listed on the cheat sheet
1/31/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: @31681422900
1/31/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And when you want to know while doing calculations just look at the two left most carries
1/31/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If those are equal there's no overflow
1/31/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No with the exeptions part
1/31/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If not then there's overflow
1/31/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: The Java translations
1/31/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ahh then just look at the calculations
1/31/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What do you mean?
1/31/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The flags that can be set by a certain command are also listed there
1/31/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And in one of the exams it was even listed when you had to check for overflow
1/31/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah but when do you check?
1/31/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: every addition you do like ADD R0 1, after that you say BVS exeption?
1/31/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: In some exercises they tell you when to check
1/31/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah this one they didnt
1/31/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: The cumulate one
1/31/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You could check after every calculation then yes...
1/31/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hahah okay
1/31/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ill just do that then
1/31/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I think If they dont ask you dont have to
1/31/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Doing that would mean like double amount of lines somethimes?
1/31/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yes
1/31/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But
1/31/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You could instead of usong the nots
1/31/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: fuck could be an xor as wel
1/31/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Just use the output signaal of Q'
1/31/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can someone maybe explain to me how to do this line in a subroutine?
1/31/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: especially the if statement
1/31/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: CMP R0 0
1/31/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: BGE ....
1/31/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Where R0 is RAM [lo]
1/31/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: True
1/31/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But swapping it to something else
1/31/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Like a xor
1/31/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Only allows you to make more mistakes
1/31/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Bc the other possibility isnt considered wrong
1/31/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So Why bother
1/31/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: yeah true
1/31/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But it is Indeed the same as a xor gate
1/31/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Its a lot quicker
1/31/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: i derived the first option from the state output table
1/31/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: And you make less mistakes with 1 gate than with 2 or more?
1/31/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You know you have to use more than c and d right?
1/31/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For inputs
1/31/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Lmao you're right Ruben
1/31/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Output of flipflops should be used as input too right?
1/31/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yes
1/31/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah and the S and T
1/31/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Those are the s and t
1/31/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And the output of the flipflops should be reconnected to those again
1/31/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Tim does that^
1/31/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh wait your right
1/31/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Didn't see those lines
1/31/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm sorreh
1/31/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Oh lol same
1/31/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: god fucking dammit
1/31/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: They are sneakily hidden
1/31/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: stressed me out there
1/31/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: sup tim
1/31/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Did everyone just say fuck it to the theoretical questions btw?
1/31/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: It's called: A E S T H E T I C S
1/31/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: yes fuck those questions
1/31/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yes
1/31/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep fuck those
1/31/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Gooood
1/31/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: How amazing would it be if litterally no one filled those in
1/31/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Everyone would lose out on 6 points
1/31/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Imagine them looking at the averages per question and just see a big 0 there
1/31/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Not that awesomeee
1/31/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Hahaha
1/31/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I mean, they are just too random to learn
1/31/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Its just getting lucky to get something you remember or know
1/31/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And worth too little points for that
1/31/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And otherwise indeed fuck them
1/31/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yep
1/31/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: jup and some are really easy and some are like what?
1/31/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah indeed
1/31/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Difference between RAM and ROM, difference between Moore and Mealy hype
1/31/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: direct indirect
1/31/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: functionally completeness
1/31/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: how do you return the value of c?
1/31/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: just say c is in R0 or something like that?
1/31/17, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: "C is "returned" in R0"
1/31/17, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: hmm ok thanks
1/31/17, 21:40 - Kevin Jilissen: <Media omitted>
1/31/17, 21:40 - Kevin Jilissen: I was just wondering if you were allowed to simplify it
1/31/17, 21:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Good luck tomorrow guys!!
1/31/17, 21:58 - Bart van Dooren: If I want to store for example x as a global variable in the ram should I say @data x ds 1 or would @data x dw 0 be better
1/31/17, 21:59 - Bart van Dooren: I want to change the variable btw :p
1/31/17, 21:59 - Bart van Dooren: For every loop
1/31/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: DS only reserves a location initialized as 0
1/31/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: DW already stores a value
1/31/17, 22:05 - Bart van Dooren: So say if I want 66 put in ram [gb+a] and then with a loop it goes down by 1 I should say at the top @data a ds 1?
1/31/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: We don't need ti use @data right?
1/31/17, 22:05 - Bart van Dooren: Can we just assume it then?
1/31/17, 22:14 - Bart van Dooren: Nvm
1/31/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: is it useful to try to memorize random informtion for the 6th question? because so far, I haven't been able to answer any of them fully correct
1/31/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and I'm not sure if I should just go over all the slides and memorize those
1/31/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Try to sleep and not drink bleach
1/31/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: That'll result in a higher grade than reading all slides
1/31/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yes
1/31/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: or drinking bleach for that matter
1/31/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You should have been able to at least answer Some of them?
1/31/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Most of the time 1 out of 3 is doable
1/31/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But im not gonna remember random stuff
1/31/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Too much Work For too little points
1/31/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: that
1/31/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: if you spend that time on the rest it's way more useful
1/31/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: plus sleeping is really important too :p
1/31/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, true
1/31/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but I'm not tired yet
1/31/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: gonna do some excercise for an hour or so, and then to bed
1/31/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Any things most of us dont know that most of us should now in preparation for the upcoming Cs exam ?
1/31/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: First question 2017 in base 8 to base 2
1/31/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: The exam wont be like any old exams theyve put online
1/31/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: What do you mean ?
1/31/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So we are fucked ?
1/31/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: How do u know nick
1/31/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: And how do u know tobin
1/31/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Ik ben master
1/31/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Tobin just compares previous calculus exams with our recent one
1/31/17, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: and previous physics exams with the one we had last week
1/31/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ahh like that
1/31/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Well true tbh
1/31/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: They keep fucking us over
1/31/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for april exam 2016, 3c): why do peope write the OR gate at the end, with a not s, and a normal t?
1/31/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: in the drive, that is
1/31/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: There are mini wrong stuff
1/31/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: in both the files from Jort and Thijs, they have that at the end, but I was wondering why
1/31/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: @31623837581 can you answer my question?
1/31/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: because m is equal to that
1/31/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: aka the output
1/31/17, 23:47 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: you make a circuit to get to an output most of the times doe you not😂
1/31/17, 23:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I know that, but I don't see where was specified that m = s' + t
1/31/17, 23:59 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Short question, studyhub 2?
2/1/17, 00:01 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: Yes
2/1/17, 00:13 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: At which letters?
2/1/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Or just somewhere in studyhub 2?
2/1/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: A-F

2/1/17, 00:15 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: You can also just go to oase, and find it in 3 seconds
2/1/17, 00:48 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Just to be sure, can you call something like
ADD R2 [GB+a]
directly, or should you first load [GB+a] into a register?
2/1/17, 00:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: would load it into a register to be sure
2/1/17, 00:53 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Do u think its gona be similiar to past exams
2/1/17, 00:55 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yeah I think so
2/1/17, 00:55 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: All the practice exams were very similar
2/1/17, 00:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Just like physics, lst, and calculus
2/1/17, 00:59 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: but this is firso
2/1/17, 00:59 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Calculus resit answers on oncourse 🙃if anyone interssted
2/1/17, 06:27 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you can do that directly. everybody's done it with [R5+TIMER] in the practicals
2/1/17, 07:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh dear :o
2/1/17, 07:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Aside from multiples that did not go entirely as planned
2/1/17, 07:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thought I did 9 and 10 very well, but have them both wrong :(
2/1/17, 07:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Rip 10 points
2/1/17, 07:29 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Can you guys open a course's files on your phone?

2/1/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i just didnt fucking know
2/1/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I wouldn't either haha
2/1/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Didnt knew i was following history classes
2/1/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When didn't you know?
2/1/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay sorry for being grammar nazi ;p
2/1/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But seriously guys I'm curious
2/1/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I literally laughed at the question and went back to the ones I skipped :p
2/1/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I heard a lot of bad things about the course during the quartile
2/1/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Was it just as fucked up as the rest or a special case of giant-anal-plug?
2/1/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Actually I think it was OK, it was a bit harder than the practice ones I think, but certainly not impossible
2/1/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage
2/1/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ermahgerd
2/1/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I actually knew this one
2/1/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: about the guy who made the first mechanical calculator, and his wife, who was the first programmer(therefore the first woman programmer as well)
2/1/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: This one was way harder than all of the exams before combined
2/1/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Started at ADD Ra + Rb and now Testcase Ra [Rb] or smth
2/1/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, how should we have done the testcase anyway? the only part I'm sure of, is the instruction fetch, and the putting RB in through the RAM
2/1/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Yeah and suddenly Assembly was a recursive question
2/1/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Like wtf
2/1/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: I just did it in a loop, that's fine too isn't it?
2/1/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: The recursion
2/1/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: that's what I did too, but I'm not sure if I applied it correctly
2/1/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: How did you guys do the L = l.next
2/1/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Load r0 = [ro+1]
2/1/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Where r0 = l
2/1/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Wtf, load r0 [r0+1]
2/1/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: I had R0 = [R0] +1
2/1/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: But written out
2/1/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: It's one word after the beginning of the class
2/1/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Since the first word was the int
2/1/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: So [address + 1]
2/1/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: you know next doesn't necessarily have to be 1
2/1/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: oh nvm
2/1/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I read it wrong
2/1/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: that's the address
2/1/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Does anyone have this year's Psychology&Technology Exam?
2/1/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: nope
2/1/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: daniel does not make the exams public
2/1/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: because he hates creating new questions
2/1/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But that kinda means good news when I still remember what I didn't know last time
2/1/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since it'll probably come back partly
2/1/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: perhaps
2/1/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: or he does have 2 versions of the exam
2/1/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But you could alway use the exam questions in the powerpoint that we created ourselves
2/1/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: guess he'll use 4 of them again
2/1/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but a lot of those seemed bullshitquestions haha
2/1/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yeah okay that's true xD
2/1/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: anyone?
2/1/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
2/1/17, 16:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: <Media omitted>
2/1/17, 16:51 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Also, be careful, answers to 1st and 2nd questions are wrong
2/1/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: Why are they wrong? They seem fine to me
2/1/17, 17:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: for example
2/1/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: Oh wait nvm
2/1/17, 17:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: it accepts "b"
2/1/17, 17:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: which is odd length sequence
2/1/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: Yes that's what I saw
2/1/17, 17:13 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: so wrong
2/1/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: But how about the second question?
2/1/17, 17:13 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: b1L right after R
2/1/17, 17:13 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: the one thatleads to halting is wrong
2/1/17, 17:14 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: it will lead to 1111221
2/1/17, 17:14 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: it has to be bbL
2/1/17, 17:15 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: To correct first question change top right accepting state to non-accepting and the right bottom non-accepting to accepting
2/1/17, 17:15 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: then it will work correctly
2/1/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: Thanks
2/1/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Do we deed to bring something to the test apart from a pen?
2/1/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I would advise a calculator
2/1/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Not allowed
2/1/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It was at the 2016 exam
2/1/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And just bringing one and not being able to use won't hurt
2/1/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If you have to do something like this without a calc it's gonna cost you a lot of time..
2/1/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
2/1/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Especially for b/c
2/1/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That would be bs
2/1/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: So either we're allowed to use a calculator
2/1/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: or we won't get those kind of exercises anymore
2/1/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: oh oke
2/1/17, 19:36 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I think it was mentioned that its not allowed
2/1/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thanks guys!
2/1/17, 19:36 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: not sure tho
2/1/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Just bring one
2/1/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: What's the worst that can happen
2/1/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: It's not hard to calculate that
2/1/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: i'll just bring it
2/1/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That's why I'm saying just bringing one won't hurt
2/1/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I didn't say it was hard
2/1/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just that it takes a lot of time to do manually
2/1/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It's not about the fact that it's not hard
2/1/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it was np-hard
2/1/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It just takes time yea
2/1/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which is bullshit to ask of you since proving you can do a calculation correctly isn't part of this course
2/1/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: <Media omitted>
2/1/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i dont get what the hell NP-hard is
2/1/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so no
2/1/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: reduction from traveling salesman
2/1/17, 19:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I guess its done the same way as hw one
2/1/17, 19:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: event he hint is the same
2/1/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I know what's hard 😏
2/1/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not me
2/1/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: im dying inside
2/1/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: Why would you have to use traveling salesman if Hamiltonian cycle is given?
2/1/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: oh than hamiltonian
2/1/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Normally I would've said you shouldn't bother with it since I haven't seen exercises asking to prove that something is NP-complete in past exams, but after today's exam it seems that you can't trust the old ones anymore haha
2/1/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: <Media omitted>
2/1/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: look at the answers from A4 guus
2/1/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Is this just yes twice or am I missing smth?
2/1/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: a) yes b) no
2/1/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: I think the 2nd is no
2/1/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: Yes computer systems threw aside everything we thought we could trust
2/1/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: The whole palindrome thing can be defined by a regular expression right?
2/1/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: No
2/1/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: no
2/1/17, 20:00 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: nope
2/1/17, 20:00 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: 1) Kleen's theorem
2/1/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yes very helpful guys
2/1/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: Because you cannot make a finite automoton
2/1/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Oke now wer're talking
2/1/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: It's kleene's thesis
2/1/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: This only worked the other way around right?
2/1/17, 20:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: 2) There exists TM that accepts marked palindromes. They cant be described by RE
2/1/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: It's on the slides
2/1/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: No?
2/1/17, 20:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Second answer is no
2/1/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: Somewhere on the slides it's explained that fa cannot accept mareked palindromes
2/1/17, 20:03 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Its in Syllabls as well
2/1/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I know, but the question is the other way around
2/1/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But Andrei convinced me
2/1/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Thanks everyone
2/1/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: A Turing machine cannot always be turned into a RE
2/1/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: the marked palingdrome is basically a counter example
2/1/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: That means one is unable to create a finite automaton that accepts a marked palindrome?
2/1/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: Yes
2/1/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes
2/1/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 🤔
2/1/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yes

2/2/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Thank you Luke 😊 we made it
2/2/17, 17:56 - Luke Houben: Good, now enjoy your 3 days off😂
2/2/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: next quartile is gonna be great, exciting things are comming
2/2/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hard things are coming
2/2/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but also that one exciting thing though
2/2/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: what one thing
2/2/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you'll see 😏
2/2/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which is?
2/2/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Something hard that is coming
2/2/17, 18:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes i am curious
2/2/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I have no idea honestly, I'm guessing Jort is talking about the sorting machine we'll be building
2/2/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Using the pp2 processor and making the sorting program in Assembly
2/2/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you know damn well what I'm on about
2/2/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I just hope it won't be hard
2/2/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But you want it to come?
2/2/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Here's a prevew: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWco7oZ9XYQ
2/2/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: That data structures test is fucking easy
2/2/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh really :o
2/2/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What's in ot
2/2/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It
2/2/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Guys
2/2/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Exams are over
2/2/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: RRelax
2/3/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: About question 4, computer systems
2/3/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Dag Johan,

Ik acht jullie in staat een conditionale branch instructie te bouwen, waarbij je ook naar de inhoud van 
de vlaggen moest kijiken. Bij deze opgave moest je inderdaad halverwege executie van de instructie kijken 
naar de C vlag, en dat gaat natuurlijk vrijwel hetzelfde. 

Een mogelijke oplossing was om de waarde van RAM[RB] in register RA te zetten, en gelijktijdig
de Z vlag te zetten. Als de Z vlag gezet is, verhoog je RA met 1. Dan schrijf je deze waarde naar
RAM[RB] en verlaag je RA weer met 1. Als de Z vlag niet gezet was hoef je verder niks te doen en
spring je naar de volgende instructie fetch. 

Ik heb jouw commentaar doorgestuurd naar de corrector van opgave 4. 

Groet, Jan Friso 
2/3/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Wtf
2/3/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: We hebben nooit zoiets moeten doen
2/3/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: "Ik acht jullie in staat..." ik acht hem in staat fatsoenlijke opgaven te maken
2/3/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: HAHAHAHHAHA
2/3/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I did that and thought it was complete bollocks
2/3/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 😂
2/3/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Accidentally got a question right
2/3/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hij acht ons tot zo iets instaat omdat " .... dat gaat natuurlijk vrijwel hetzelfde."
2/3/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Kk op man
2/3/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Partieel integreren gaat ook vrijwel het zelfde als 2 + 2 als je het eenmaal begrijpt maar je verwacht toch ook niet dat kinderen in groep 3 dat kunnen?
2/3/17, 10:28 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Naja "Ik acht jullie in staat een conditionele jump te bouwen".. Waar was onze displacement?
2/3/17, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: What instruction checks z flag?
2/3/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No clue
2/3/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Ipv displacement dan +1 of zo laten, is niet heel ver gezocht toch?
2/3/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Is gewoon een jump instruction met iets anders als displacement
2/3/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: is there anything i should read through before starting the prior knowledge test for data structures?
2/3/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Induction if you don't remember it
2/3/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: aight
2/3/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: thats it?
2/3/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: There's more stuff but I can't remember everything
Logarithms too 
I think there's a page about the content of the test
2/3/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Just read the links that are there
2/3/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Some about arrays and linked lists, vertices and edges, binary trees
2/3/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Sth about leaves and nodes and shit might be helpful
2/3/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Takes 20 mins to read/watch all that, then 20 mins to do it
2/3/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Really easy
2/3/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: where can i find that?
2/3/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Same page as the test really
2/3/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz i havent come across any links or whatsoever
2/3/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: It's like "more study material" or some shiy
2/3/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ah the "study material
2/3/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: aigh
2/3/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: aight
2/3/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: gonna check it out then
2/3/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Good luck 😉
2/3/17, 10:59 - Luke Houben: Don't be surprised if you score a 6.3 and it still says your prior knowledge is insufficient
2/3/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: are they retarted?
2/3/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>

2/3/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: would have been nice tho
2/3/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: to know what a linked list was before CS exam
2/3/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Why?
2/3/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Oh the class pointer to the next you mean or what
2/3/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: well bc the assembly ex was about a linked list
2/3/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and i had no clue what that even was
2/3/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not that i would have done better if i knew probably, but still
2/3/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: It was implied how it worked though 😁

2/3/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Hi Is there a place where i can see the topics of the preknowledge test
2/3/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I just started the test and googled the thing I didn't know got an 8.1 and didn't even do the 'proof'
2/3/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: It's not that hard if you did fundamentals and logic
2/3/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oki i got it
2/3/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Yeah its basically induction and algorithms
2/3/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: thanks

2/3/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Do we need a book for data structures or DBL embedded systems ?
2/3/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: There is one, for data structures i believe
2/3/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: what does it cost?
2/3/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and which one

2/3/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The adobe cc install should be there but I can't reach it ;/
2/3/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Imagine all the things u could buy instead of 46 euro book
2/3/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: Imagine all the exams you could pass instead of not buying the book
2/3/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Been passing exams since 2K16 without buying books
2/3/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I only bought the physics book this quartile and that was a big mistake
2/3/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Only used the pdfs
2/3/17, 18:50 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: @31643222030 the Adobe package is still on my drive if you want it

2/3/17, 22:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: guys did any of you notice our program ? should I be worried about 70 DLB embedded systems a day and 99 Modeling in Monday ?
2/3/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 70 and 99 what?
2/3/17, 22:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i know that's not how its supposed to be but still shouldn't it properly display so you can plan your life ?
2/3/17, 22:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: you know sander 2 of the 3 subjects we have q3
2/3/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: no clue what you are takling about with those numbers
2/3/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: He's talking about how fucked up our roster is
2/3/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: ahh
2/3/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: because they only give the time of all th stuff

2/3/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: well will only have to go to 50% of the classes probs
2/3/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: modelling is only online lectures
2/3/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: so
2/3/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: lol really?

2/4/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: How much time do we have when we start pre knowledge test
2/4/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: One and a half hour.
2/4/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Isil its just calc and logic (induction)
2/4/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: I skimmed through it and got a 4 in 10 min
2/4/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: :D okay
2/4/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Idk why im so creepd out by it🙂
2/4/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: plus it's just for advice
2/4/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: they don't really care about the result
2/4/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: <Media omitted>
2/4/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Rule 4 says 3^(n-1) but the induction hypothesis says (3^n)-1
2/4/17, 14:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
2/4/17, 14:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Dafuq

2/4/17, 14:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: We dont know what do something is we dont know what n is ?
2/4/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: I thought it would be n-1 since they said TO, not including
2/4/17, 14:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Or am i thinking wrong ?
2/4/17, 14:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh shit i read the question wrong
2/4/17, 14:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Maybe you are right
2/4/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Are you sure TO means not including?
2/4/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: They would say UNTIL in that case i suppose
2/4/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Maybe i am wrong
2/4/17, 14:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: count from 1 to 5
2/4/17, 14:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 1
2/4/17, 14:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 2

2/4/17, 14:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oops sorry for spam
2/4/17, 14:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: the point is isil might be right
2/4/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: N+1
2/4/17, 14:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but why ?
2/4/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: For loop it will run until the loop will not hold anymore
2/4/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: So it will run the loop until i = n but when i = n+1 it will stop
2/4/17, 14:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
2/4/17, 14:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Eeeh ? How do we answer this ?

2/4/17, 14:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐔
2/4/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: It's diagnostic don't worry about it
2/4/17, 14:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: still I am curious
2/4/17, 14:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can I just say induction hypothesys is wrong ?
2/4/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I think so
2/4/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: At the end you get answers for everything
2/4/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: a_(k-1) is not defined
2/4/17, 14:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: uuugh fuck this induction bullshit
2/4/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I got a 6.4
2/4/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: What the fuck
2/4/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I did it in 20 mins filling in mostly bs
2/4/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I had an 8.2 with 45 mins, so that was rather easy
2/4/17, 16:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I got 6.9 and I didn't even bother to do induction writing
2/4/17, 16:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :D
2/4/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
2/4/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well then I'll just try
2/4/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should I recap anything first?
2/4/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or just go for it
2/4/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Read the required knowledge stuff
2/4/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Then you'll be fine
2/4/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Oh, and know how to do induction
2/4/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: okidoki
2/4/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm feeling tired
2/4/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is gon' be a bad grade
2/4/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: :p
2/4/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I had a 6.3 so obviously that's insufficient hahah
2/4/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: Is the deadline today or tomorrow for the test?
2/4/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Tomorrow
2/4/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: How much is sufficient?
2/4/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: It is depended per section of the test I think
2/4/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But it doesn't matter what you get tho
2/4/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: You won't be excluded from the course, even if you get a 0
2/4/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I had every section above the recommended score
2/4/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But still not sufficient haha
2/4/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah the calculation is pretty weird
2/4/17, 19:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I got everything above aveage and integration below and i got 6.9 and i was sufficient knowloedge
2/4/17, 19:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Didnt do 3 of the integration ones at all
2/4/17, 19:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Seems like its a rngesus
2/4/17, 19:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait what
2/4/17, 19:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You guys got integration?
2/4/17, 19:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which test did I do
2/4/17, 19:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sorry
2/4/17, 19:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Induction
2/4/17, 19:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐔👌
2/4/17, 19:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😅
2/4/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pfeww 😂
2/5/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Tomorrow first hour there wont be any lecture right?
2/5/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: SfS is 2nd hour
2/5/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 9:45 right?
2/5/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or 10:45
2/5/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: modelling?

2/5/17, 17:31 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: taught it might be useful
2/5/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: lol embedded systems everywhere
2/5/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Claudiu ty
2/5/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Tutor meeting??

2/5/17, 21:33 - Luke Houben: REMINDER: Make sure you all finished the pre-knowledge test of data structures!
2/5/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Otherwise you're pretty fucked
2/5/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 83411377‬: 👆🏻
2/5/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Thats way better than 08.45
2/6/17, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: Anyone knows what we have to do in the "eigen ogo ruimte" of embedded systems?
2/6/17, 08:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: embedded systems is a project
2/6/17, 08:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so in that ogo room you work with your assigned group on that project
2/6/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: the groups will be announced tomorrow, so attendation is mandatory tomorrow
2/6/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Work with your group
2/6/17, 08:54 - Luke Houben: How many finals do we have to make then in 8 weeks? Just 1?
2/6/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: 2
2/6/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: modelling and data structures
2/6/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so 2
2/6/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Modelling has a final test
2/6/17, 08:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Counts 60% for modelling, the final
2/6/17, 08:55 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: 40%
2/6/17, 08:55 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: But basically everything is ogo ruimte so does that mean that you can make appointments with your group to work within the given hours?
2/6/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: <Media omitted>
2/6/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Also outside the given hours I guess
2/6/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: But you have to make time with your group to work on it
2/6/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes, they just scheduled in when you sortof should do that so it's easier to obligate some teammates to come when they are a pain in the ass
2/6/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Do you get put into a group?
2/6/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No
2/6/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For modelling you already chose your group
2/6/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: On Oase
2/6/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For embedded I mean😅
2/6/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 🙊
2/6/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Idk, we will hear it tomorrow I guess
2/6/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: This
2/6/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: Probably put into a group
2/6/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hope we may choose
2/6/17, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Yeah daan
2/6/17, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Because you have embedded systems as well
2/6/17, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Hihi
2/6/17, 09:02 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: There was sth in the mail for embedded systems like "the groups will be announced" if I recall correctly so I think they'll place you in some group
2/6/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait what am I doing indeed John
2/6/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't even have that courze
2/6/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What about data structures
2/6/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: courze
2/6/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jeweetzelluf
2/6/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is the mathematical proof thing from data structures important? Because it was listed as a mini course or smth
2/6/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What? :P
2/6/17, 09:14 - Luke Houben: Induction?
2/6/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I thought I read something about a mini course in mathematical proofs, with iduction and contradiction, for people that struggled with it
2/6/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: It is already planned during lecture hours so just turn up and try to learn shit
2/6/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah alright, thanks
2/6/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 'try to learn shit'😂

2/6/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is there a group division for data structures?
2/6/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The guy-lecturer hasn't said so
2/6/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But the woman apparently did

2/6/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You can register for one on oase right now
2/6/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Done!
2/6/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: ignaz was cool she said right?

2/6/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Welp, i need a partner now, the tutor group is full.. anyone without a partner for DS yet?
2/6/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Weekly quizzes 3NAB2 just got uploaded to oase
2/6/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I guess the final won't take long now
2/6/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: You are 2 weeks late
2/6/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Famalam
2/6/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I appreciate you start your sentence with weekly, saved me a heart attack
2/6/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It has already been on there For like 2 weeks
2/6/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Not on the "results" page of oase,
2/6/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: It only was a .pdf
2/6/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: For me it's already uploaded just now..
2/6/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Olso*
2/6/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Also*
2/6/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Also on oase
2/6/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: At least For me
2/6/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Was just uploaded for me
2/6/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Ah well
2/6/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: They should make a data structures group for people for didnt follow fundamentals and those who did
2/6/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: That would be faster
2/6/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Just change fundamentals group name
2/6/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Done
2/6/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He means course-wide
2/6/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Can I have the link?
2/6/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No😈
2/6/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Yeah for the lectures
2/6/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 😔
2/6/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Please?
2/6/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How do you get a link for a group?😂
2/6/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Anyone knows where I can buy a raspberry pi 3 for cheap
2/6/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I would like to get the link as well
2/6/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31649673225
2/6/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Interneeeet
2/6/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Google it
2/6/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Tweakers.net/pricewatch
2/6/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I googled it but it is supposed to be $35 but European websites that I found usually sell it for more than that
2/6/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Anyways thanks for the link
2/6/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They're like 35 euro's everwhere
2/6/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's logical. If something costs 35 dollars, and you take into account that the euro is worth more than the dollar, it obviously costs at least 40 euros

2/6/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay which hero asked *the* question
2/6/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: @31642007885
2/6/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I didn't asked it :/
2/6/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 👏🏻
2/6/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Still a hero turtle man
2/6/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Thank you
2/6/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: What wuestion?
2/6/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Question?
2/6/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 28844767‬: I have a telegram group for Datastructures: https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEHIBuoDVvm31N9-RA
2/6/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Please dont use Both Whatsapp and telegram😔
2/6/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 28844767‬: I'm from EE and we only use telegram 😂
2/6/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: whats telegram?
2/6/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 13850516‬: Blue whatsapp
2/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Max
2/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Create a group for datastructures
2/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: 😘😘
2/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: How did you end up in a software Science groupchat 😂
2/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Is telegram just literally the shittier, less known whatsapp?
2/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Not owned by facebook is the main reason to use it right
2/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Both SfS and WbS have data structures, no need for a seperate groupchat
2/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31628151420 is that even nessesary?
2/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 13850516‬: Pretty much
2/6/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this
2/6/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Not spam turtle
2/6/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: just discussing whether or not to make another groupchat
2/6/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Telegram>whatsapp
2/6/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: It's alright
2/6/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 28844767‬: I think it is easier to have different groups for different courses, but thats just my opinion :)
2/6/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: So I'm pro
2/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well Whatsapp doesn't save any messages at all either. That was the sole reason Telegram became known
2/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Then you just get spammed to shi though
2/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I liked the fundamentals only group, sorts questions and answers per course
2/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: So I like an extra group
2/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Yeah but, that's because fundamentals was an elective
2/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I agree
2/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I like an extra group, but not extra apps
2/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Data structures is mandatory
2/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Does Telegram have a windows application
2/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: True but still easier to use than this app was for cs and physics at the same time
2/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If not it's a NOPE
2/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Dw stekoverflow is live soon
2/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yess
2/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And a web version
2/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: That is standalone
2/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Whatsapp does check your metadata though iirc
2/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: So you don't actually need to install any app
2/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: https://chat.whatsapp.com/6Qehj56nyjd7UOIrDMF5jT
2/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: There
2/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the data structures group
2/6/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: https://chat.whatsapp.com/LANNB6EFltD9wwCkALy4hd
2/6/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks Max
2/6/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Modeling group
2/6/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: https://chat.whatsapp.com/G7MXNoMrNC23FRsl34j7g2

Embedded systems
2/6/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I assume the course-specific chats are Spam=Kick as well
2/6/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thats the intention
2/6/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I would say yes
2/6/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬ added ‪+31 6 42623926‬
2/6/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Don't all the course specific chats make this one obsolete though?
2/6/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Or do we just make this one the general one
2/6/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: For questions about timeslots and such
2/6/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Idk I thought this one was for courses we all had
2/6/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: And we had different chats for electives
2/6/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But now I have 14 chats with 1000 messages every hour
2/6/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Isn't it maybe better to switch to a different platform like IRC or slack or discord?
2/6/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You can ask all (serious) question here and we'll keep this one for general use
2/6/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because WhatsApp doesn't really have the required functionality for this amount of people
2/6/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: What do you suppose ?
2/6/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm
2/6/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I think it works fine like this. Remember, we will still have the same amount of messages, just spread out over group chats
2/6/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I heard good stories both about slack and discord
2/6/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: It shouldn't cause any problems
2/6/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Discord doesn't work great on mobiles though
2/6/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Dont worry, we are setting up a system that will solve all these issues. Coming soon
2/6/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Thanks Jort. You're our hero
2/6/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: No further details will be released as of yet
2/6/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: We can always switch if this doesn't word
2/6/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Work
2/6/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: But you will have orgasms when using it
2/6/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 🙌🏻
2/6/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: We're gonna be software scientists. Shouldn't we be able to just design a new app?
2/6/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: We could
2/6/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: As a side project
2/6/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: We are almost done woth that
2/6/17, 17:13 - Luke Houben: Some of us, like jort said, are already doing something like that
2/6/17, 17:13 - Luke Houben: ^
2/6/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is there a githubm
2/6/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: ?
2/6/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Aight
2/6/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We're trying to release this week
2/6/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: We will launch this week. Just board the hype train on time
2/6/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Are you releasing an iOS and android version ?
2/6/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Windows phone only
2/6/17, 17:15 - Luke Houben: Fully responsive
2/6/17, 17:15 - Luke Houben: Web app
2/6/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Mobile website that is has a really nice webinterface on mobile
2/6/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 🖕🏻
2/6/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Can we not make it into an app?
2/6/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: By the way, mad respect to you people working on it
2/6/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: You're doing gods work
2/6/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Modern responsive web can be just as good as an app
2/6/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Hmmm idk
2/6/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not necesarry, webapp works nicely
2/6/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Alright, if you guys say so
2/6/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Let's first try this out and see what Jort and co come up with
2/6/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Im curious in what way your webapp will be superior to WhatsApp
2/6/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Or discord or Skype etc
2/6/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just wait and see
2/6/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Keep in mind we're countering all problems we're experiencing ourselves with other systems and combining the best options. This is not made by teachers ;)
2/6/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Yeah but dont all communication apps do thag
2/6/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: That
2/6/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm excited to see, but tbh I'm not hopeful
2/6/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: surprise me tho
2/6/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Same
2/6/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Probably will
2/6/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Just skeptical
2/6/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Logical
2/6/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You can better be skeptical and surprised than hyped and disappointed
2/6/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: true
2/6/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Let's stop spamming the shit out of everyone for now though
2/6/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thanks
2/6/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: what is this?  ∂
2/6/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: that thingy
2/6/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: its all over the modeling test haha
2/6/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: modeling test?
2/6/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what modeling test
2/6/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: the weakly
2/6/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: do we have weekly modeling tests?
2/6/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: Yes
2/6/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It is like the d in dy/dx, but you use this ∂ for partial derivatives
2/6/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: its a delta right
2/6/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: not 15 apps for chat please
2/6/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: just ask every question here
2/6/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: that's what this app is for
2/6/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ikr
2/6/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: ∂ is not a delta (δ)
2/6/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think I should watch the modeling videos to understand the partial integration d?
2/6/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Isnt it the same as calculus?
2/6/17, 19:25 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It is just differentiating with respect to x or y, where you consider the other variable as a constant.
2/6/17, 19:26 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You can watch the video for a clear explanation, but we also had to these derivations for physics with wave formulas (y(x,t)=...)
2/6/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Any Overleaf pro's here?
2/6/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I got a question about it
2/6/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: About overleaf or LaTeX?
2/6/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: overleaf
2/6/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then not
2/6/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: http://cs-students.nl/ now works \o/
2/6/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I know that in TexStudio I could have multiple documents that I could call from a main document
2/6/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How does that work in Overleaf
2/6/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh yes
2/6/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is the shit guys ;)
2/6/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: oeps
2/6/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: This is the shit that's still under development
2/6/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
2/6/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This was a very professional error because those happen
2/6/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yup
2/6/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Please have some patience and respect ;p
2/6/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: <Media omitted>
2/6/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: that was not meant for this chat
2/6/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: my sincere apologies
2/6/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: we will get shit going asap
2/6/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: please all board the hype train
2/6/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
2/6/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fill it up with coals
2/6/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I shall
2/6/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Hey everyone i cannot access the solutions of the exercises of the lecture notes
2/6/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I cannot find them on oncourse ; just an empty folder
2/6/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: it crashed my oncourse when i clicked on it...
2/6/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 57866325‬: In the study guide it is said that they will be posted during the course
2/6/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah you have to logout via the login url first
2/6/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: hmm thanks
2/6/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: and why is this a thing?
2/6/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I think it locks the embedded state that canvas forces on it for your account
2/6/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because TU/e and information systems
2/6/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For some reason
2/6/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: @31643157069 i cannot find it unfortantely 
Would u plz post it here ?
2/6/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: In a weird way
2/6/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: https://oncourse.tue.nl/2016/login/
2/6/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Use that
2/6/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Click on logout
2/6/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And login again
2/6/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That should fix it
2/6/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I cant get in mohamed
2/6/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And the assignment seems to be locked still for some reason
2/6/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yes plz @31643157069 😊
2/6/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
2/6/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For me the course isn't even listed on oncoarse..
2/6/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Has anyone been able to find the book for modeling? Our tutor asked us to make the exercises from chapter 6 till 9 but I can't find a book or something..
2/6/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: What is the best LaTeX editor according to you guys?
2/6/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: ShareLaTeX
2/6/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm using overleaf and I'm liking it

2/6/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Eh, just a difference in interface
2/6/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I used both for a short period of time, I do not dislike any of the two, but so far Overleaf looks more fancy and versatile

2/6/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You might as Well get familiar with it by using it For small projects
2/6/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And for data structures
2/6/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You need it for embedded systems
2/6/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It has to be in latex afaik
2/6/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hmm

2/7/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is anyway able yet to start the Datastructures Quiz 1?
2/7/17, 13:03 - Luke Houben: Any idea why the output pins are not working on the PP2 processor? Conneted a LED or Motor to the output but it doesn't do anything and the red LED turns on.
2/7/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: what's your code?
2/7/17, 13:06 - Luke Houben: oh wth suddenly it works
2/7/17, 13:06 - Luke Houben: Wait hang on
2/7/17, 13:09 - Luke Houben: Lol suddenly the light works but not the motor
2/7/17, 13:10 - Luke Houben: This is my basic code: @DATA
	IOAREA      EQU  -16  ;  address of the I/O-Area, modulo 2^18
    INPUT      EQU    7  ;  position of the input buttons (relative to IOAREA)
   OUTPUT      EQU   11  ;  relative position of the power outputs
   DSPDIG      EQU    9  ;  relative position of the 7-segment display's digit selector
   DSPSEG      EQU    8  ;  relative position of the 7-segment display's segments
    TIMER	   EQU   13  ;  relative position of the TIMER 
@CODE
 main:  LOAD R5 IOAREA
 		LOAD R0 %11111111
 		STOR R0 [R5+OUTPUT]
 		BRA main

 @END
2/7/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: maybe you have faulty wiring
2/7/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: or your output position is wrong
2/7/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: If the leds are red you need to push a button on the pp2
2/7/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You need to reset the output or something,
2/7/17, 13:20 - Luke Houben: Yeah but after pushing it turned red again inmediatly
2/7/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: It's a button and it's is in the manual of the pp2
2/7/17, 13:20 - Luke Houben: But thanks for the answers, turned out the motor was broken
2/7/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Then you short-circuit
2/7/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: okay
2/7/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: got it working?
2/7/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: It's a failsafe
2/7/17, 13:21 - Luke Houben: Yeah it works now, just thought it had to do something with the pp2
2/7/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: okay nice
2/7/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 14336980‬: Anyone who doesn't have a partner in data structures? I missed Monday because I was out of the country.
2/7/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 18545037‬: You have to sign in for a tutor group, and within your tutor group you have to find a partner for data structures
2/7/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Is no one able to access quiz 1 of data structures?
2/7/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: <Media omitted>

2/7/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What do you mean with adress?
2/7/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I want to just turn on the motor, but it's connected to the H bridges right. But just turning on all output didn't work :/
2/7/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Nevermind we are dumb
2/7/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Welcome to the club

2/7/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Question about embedded systems: The study guide says to mark any components that are missing from the kit, where should I do this?
2/7/17, 16:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: on the same paper
2/7/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i dont know, we did it on that form

2/7/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Do you guys have a lot of missing components?
2/7/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: please dont start building and coding your robot already
2/7/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For us mostly buidling things were missing
2/7/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: stick to the study guide, youll get lost otherwise
2/7/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31644497802
2/7/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: We missed 1 complete component, and 1 of 6 of another

2/7/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We're missing 20 pieces from 2 components
2/7/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: We missed 20 (identical) components
2/7/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: and some others, which we mostly miss only one from
2/7/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: same

2/7/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: 37237 was the code for the ones we missed
2/7/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Do you also have to note if you have too many of a component btw?
2/7/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Note that some stuff on the list are alraedy combined
2/7/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: OMG ERIC

2/7/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Data structures doesn't have a project right?
2/7/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: oh wait

2/7/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because they think the course should be about skills, and not about remembering stuff
2/7/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: like the same bullshit we get for CS
2/7/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ah that bullshit again

2/7/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Not that I know but you gotta finish the first assignment for data and modelling this week
2/7/17, 21:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: is that in osas or canvas
2/7/17, 22:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>

2/7/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: The quiz is part of homework assignment 1
2/7/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Yeah I cant either
2/7/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Why cant i hand in my self reflection with belbin roles thingy
2/7/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You probably have to email it along with the other of your group
2/7/17, 22:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guys, I have sent a mail to mr. Rutter from Datastructures regarding the Quiz 1 problem most of us seem to be encountering (being unable to open it)
2/7/17, 22:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Received a reply that it should be working (he just checked) and I should mail Arthur if it still doesn't
2/7/17, 22:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So I did that with an attached error screenshot
2/7/17, 22:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They're listed as deadlines in the studyguide as deadlines too so we might just have to email it or something like that
2/7/17, 22:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will report back
2/7/17, 22:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
2/7/17, 22:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: still cant open quiz 1
2/7/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Is there even someone that can open the quiz?
2/7/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I guess it's just blocked for everyone
2/7/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: It says unavailable to students so probably that's the reason why he can open it
2/7/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Quiz works for me
2/7/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: <Media omitted>

2/7/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They must've fixed it quickly
2/7/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And emailed back that it worked
2/7/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Ofc they never wanna admit they did something wrong or something wasnt working on their side
2/7/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: So they do it this way and pretend it worked all this tine
2/7/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Does last attempt mean you can try multiple times?
2/7/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I guess so?
2/7/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
2/7/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Works now :)

2/7/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He admitted it just fine
2/7/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Hahahah Daan

2/7/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It was rather short
2/7/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: He did add this ':S' though
2/7/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nono

2/7/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Rutter was short
2/7/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Arthur was nice
2/7/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Ohhh that one was for Rutter

2/8/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: With us 100 people we would get 1000 points in 10 days this way
2/8/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which is a lot obviously

2/8/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well 10 does the same as 8 :p
2/8/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's just at least 8 I suppose
2/8/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: A lot of new games also don't state anything about 10
2/8/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: old file i guess
2/8/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering you pay a brand-new €1950 each year there is a suspiciously large amount of 10-year old slides and such which contain errors that supposedly weren't noticed earlier
2/8/17, 15:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: daan half of the lecturers think they are a demigod child of jesus and the staff is just lazy ass not caring pde /phd/some other shit
2/8/17, 15:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: no matter how muc money they get they wont fix shit because organization in the uni is lower than a ghetto hobo gang
2/8/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Whaha, true
2/8/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: lazy ass not caring phd is funny
2/8/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: because it is true in this case but those people had to be hard-working some time
2/8/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Else you won't reach that point
2/8/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So I wonder how they got there
2/8/17, 15:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: did you do quiz 1 ?
2/8/17, 15:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can I ask if there is a difference of sum with upper bound log or just n ?
2/8/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: You can
2/8/17, 15:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: are you edgy you cunt :>
2/8/17, 15:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: wanna fight ?
2/8/17, 15:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: huh ?
2/8/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: well technically
2/8/17, 15:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yeh  I tought so now crawl back to your corner

2/8/17, 15:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: spam chat turned into  Don't write anything or you will be answered with an edgy response ?
2/8/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: [ spam = wait until thomas vente answers ]
2/8/17, 15:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: AYYY
2/8/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You mean the sum until log(n) or the sum until n?
2/8/17, 15:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
2/8/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is not different to calculate with, but it either stays log(n) or it stays n
2/8/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Thats the gangster i was before the church of the spaghetti monster changed me
2/8/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ramen!

2/8/17, 16:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: sorry

2/8/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: The first one seems wrong
2/8/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Because there is only a 1 after the summation sign, the i and j aren't there
2/8/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: There should be an i
2/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, it is correct
2/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yes it is
2/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: it adds one for j until i
2/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: robin having one means that you will get just I*1
2/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: and i is for every n
2/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: which is I
2/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: rick my lord I love you :}
2/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can you check the others too
2/8/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: With the second one, how did you get log n ^2
2/8/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: oh, wait
2/8/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: that one seems pretty legit as well

2/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: all of them kinda make sense
2/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: but im not really sure tbh
2/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can we repeat quiz ?
2/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is this for DS?
2/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: or modeling?
2/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: DS
2/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ds
2/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then I don't know
2/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can we redo it after
2/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: on grading it said last attempt
2/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: does that mean they grade the last attempt only ?
2/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think so it was the same in calc online test rite ?
2/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No
2/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They give a grade
2/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: should have done it last day AKA with other people
2/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which takes a very fucking long time to update
2/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And then you can try again
2/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Or you can try again directly
2/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But then you don't know your grade yet
2/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oh so its not a bog deal for me
2/8/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I hd 7.5/8 but idk what I did wrong lol
2/8/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: has to be one of the first exercise
2/8/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: you can try it again and sent your answers here so we can check it
2/8/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: how do you know it has to be one of the first?
2/8/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because those are 4 which count for 2 points
2/8/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And the second is 6 for 6 points ;)

2/8/17, 17:44 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Isn't it nlog(n)
2/8/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I put n outside
2/8/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: And apply the formula
2/8/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: N times n plus one divided by two
2/8/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Which is n squared
2/8/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Logn squares
2/8/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Times n
2/8/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Squared
2/8/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oh ur asking i (n)
2/8/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Sry
2/8/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 4n plus log n factorial
2/8/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Log n! Smaller than n so just eliminated that
2/8/17, 18:22 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Why factorial?
2/8/17, 18:23 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Log(n) is constant
2/8/17, 18:23 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's should be 4n + n*log(n)
2/8/17, 18:23 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Isnt it?
2/8/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: N changes
2/8/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: In sum
2/8/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 1-2-3-4....
2/8/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Loga + Logb = log ab

2/8/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Half and 11 in the same sentence made half past 10 in my head
2/8/17, 23:47 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Haha no woeekws
2/8/17, 23:47 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Worries ***
2/8/17, 23:47 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: The go do sth fun still stands though
2/8/17, 23:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: emergency trip to stratum :P?
2/8/17, 23:49 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Phew.. I had all kinds off woeekws
2/8/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: But I'll stop or we're gonna piss off turtle man
2/8/17, 23:55 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: where is this from exactly? what subject?
2/8/17, 23:55 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: The math part of modelling
2/8/17, 23:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: is that like a weekly quiz as well?
2/8/17, 23:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: before when should we finish that?
2/8/17, 23:56 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeahh I think it is before Sunday every week if I recall correctly
2/8/17, 23:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: also this week's sunday?
2/8/17, 23:57 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I'll check to be sure but I think so
2/8/17, 23:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: fml
2/8/17, 23:59 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ohh it's not 😅
2/8/17, 23:59 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Every Friday but starting next week
2/8/17, 23:59 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: So the first test is due to next Friday
2/8/17, 23:59 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: But already available
2/9/17, 00:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Ah, thank god
2/9/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Really next friday? I just assumed it to be this weeks friday but nvm thats great
2/9/17, 00:26 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Hey guys 
Where can I find the list of available USE subjects for q4 ?
2/9/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Is it the same one as for electives ?
2/9/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: what even is USE?
2/9/17, 00:28 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
2/9/17, 00:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: so a package of 3 electives with a certain theme?
2/9/17, 00:33 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I am sorry I do not understand what you mean.
@31681422900
2/9/17, 00:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: so a use is basically the same as an elective, only a use consists of 3 different subjects that all have the same theme?
2/9/17, 00:35 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I am not sure tbh 😅
2/9/17, 00:39 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: I think USE is supposed to be like less technical and more critical thinking and stuff but I don't know. That's just what I heard
2/9/17, 00:52 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: And where can I find such subjects ?
Can I just choose any subjects from the list of electives as my USE ?
2/9/17, 01:01 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: A elective is a subject just like any other subject you have.
2/9/17, 01:03 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: An USE is a package, it's often considered easier and it's idd less technical. It can be anything "participating in a software contest" / "doing research about robots" / Entrepeneurship etc
2/9/17, 01:03 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: There are 3 phases
2/9/17, 01:03 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Exploration Specialization and Application
2/9/17, 01:03 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: More info about them here:
2/9/17, 01:04 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: <Media omitted>
2/9/17, 01:04 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: On the PlanApp
2/9/17, 01:05 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: You can see a list of Electives
2/9/17, 01:05 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: And a list of USE-trajects
2/9/17, 01:05 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: You only have to choose one USE package (3 courses = 15 ECS)
2/9/17, 01:06 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: You can choose more, if you'd want to. But it wouldn't count as elective. Just for personal interests or smt
2/9/17, 01:06 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Keep in mind not to choose electives which are prohibited for your major
2/9/17, 01:06 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: For example
2/9/17, 01:06 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Creative Programming
2/9/17, 01:06 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Because it looks too much like Programming
2/9/17, 01:07 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: https://educationguide.tue.nl/programs/bachelor-college/elective-courses/overlap-courses/
2/9/17, 01:07 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Here you can find links to all overlap courses for each major
2/9/17, 01:07 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: The USE course that we have in Q4 is an introduction, where we don't get to choose anything. In the 2nd or 3rd year we get 3 more USE courses which we can put in any of the elective/use spaces of the curriculum
2/9/17, 01:07 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Yes idd
2/9/17, 01:07 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: USE in quartile 4
2/9/17, 01:08 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Is a basic course
2/9/17, 01:08 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Like it's mandarory
2/9/17, 01:08 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Think of it like an introduction
2/9/17, 01:09 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: It does NOT count as USE in your major. You do have to choose an USE package for the 2nd or 3rd (or 4rd) year
2/9/17, 01:12 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: @31611725278 can you give us a lecture on how to plan our lectures?
2/9/17, 01:13 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: HAHAH sure mate
2/9/17, 01:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: gewis midnight lectures
2/9/17, 01:19 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: And do I need to have at least 3 use subjects ?
2/9/17, 01:23 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Yes
2/9/17, 01:23 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: But you'll have that automatically
2/9/17, 01:24 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Every USE packae has at least three subjects:
• An exploration subject
• A specilization (there are sometimes multiple subjects here to choose from)
• An application subject

2/9/17, 01:29 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Moreover
2/9/17, 01:29 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: It's mandatory since 2014 to participate in at least 5 studium generale activities
2/9/17, 01:29 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: It's explained right here
2/9/17, 01:29 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: <Media omitted>
2/9/17, 01:31 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Here you can see a few SG activities. However pay attention whether they have an USE logo besides them, because only those will count as USE SG activities.

http://m.studiumgenerale-eindhoven.nl/nl
2/9/17, 01:31 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ahhh
I see thank you Damien :)
2/9/17, 01:32 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: No problem
2/9/17, 01:35 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: I'd recommend to start your SG as soon as possible. Because most people just simply forget about them. You can do a workshop storytelling, watch a documentary, go to an exhibition about flirting, stuff like that. Some activities are free and some cost money (like 10 euros or smt). It's just a way of forcing you to get to know more about culture, art and stuff like that. To develop more skills besides your technical ones
2/9/17, 01:46 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ahhh ok 👍🏻👌🏻
2/9/17, 07:27 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Thanks damien!
2/9/17, 07:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Morning beautiful
2/9/17, 07:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: To all the people that have class at doomshour aka 8 in the morning aka the fuck up people who cant aleep
2/9/17, 07:47 - ‪+31 6 28844767‬: I recommend the social robots use track, because the technical specialisation course has a lot of overlap with computer science major and the first course didn't cost much time
2/9/17, 07:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sorry if it was a bit homoerotic
2/9/17, 07:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😐🐍👌
2/9/17, 07:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, if you get your teaching certificate, you don't have to do USE. You will get your 2nd degree certificate for computer science
2/9/17, 08:10 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: how do you get your teaching certificate ?
2/9/17, 08:12 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: It's a Dutch program only I think
2/9/17, 08:12 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: https://www.tue.nl/universiteit/over-de-universiteit/eindhoven-school-of-education/studeren/beginnen-in-je-bachelor/
2/9/17, 08:13 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: You can do a master to get a teaching license, however you can do part of the program in your bachelor already.
2/9/17, 08:15 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: If you finish the bachelor part, you get a license to teach on the Dutch 'equivalent' of Junior High School. (The secondary education system is really different in NL)
2/9/17, 08:16 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: If you finish the master part after, you can teach all grades of High School
2/9/17, 08:18 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: The Bachelor part consists of two Elective Packages each 15 ECTS. So a total of 6 electives.
2/9/17, 08:20 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: oh ok thanks ^
2/9/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: are there more people where the mark of the data structures test dus not show up after 12+ hours?
2/9/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I got it within 15 minutes
2/9/17, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: oh...
2/9/17, 09:00 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: when did you do the test? maybe they changed it
2/9/17, 09:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yesterday morning
2/9/17, 09:03 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: oh okay i did it in the afternoon
2/9/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is there a DBL group that is not meeting today, but has his stuff in U5. Because we don't have a connector cable for our PP2 yet, so if we could borrow yours 😬
2/9/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You can just use any generic USB-B cable
2/9/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But we don't have one of those
2/9/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Doesn't anyone have it lying around? They are pretty common
2/9/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: uhm, none of us has oen
2/9/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: one*
2/9/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm, is U5 the paviljoen?
2/9/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yes
2/9/17, 09:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, where can I find what specifically has to be done for thursday deadline for modeling group assignment
2/9/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay, then I can't help you
2/9/17, 09:08 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: No problem, thanks anyway
2/9/17, 09:11 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Please, guys, I cant find it..
2/9/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 16916261‬ left
2/9/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Andrei hang on
2/9/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: I'll show you
2/9/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: If you go to Modelling in Canvas
2/9/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: There is a folder "Group Assignment Template" or smt
2/9/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: There you'll find this

2/9/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: This is a rubric showing how they will determine your grade
2/9/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: For thursday you have to make Version 1
2/9/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: You'll see that they will only mark 5 boxes then. On the right you'll see about what part of the report it is. For example: "V.1:8" means. Version 1, point 8 (aka the sub-questions)
2/9/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: No problem

2/9/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Guys, data structures question 3.b, should we analize the worst-case runtime?
2/9/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: yes
2/9/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: always analyse the worst case
2/9/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Thanks
2/9/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: if you think about it this algorithm does not have a "best" or "worst" case
2/9/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: no not really
2/9/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: well it does
2/9/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: best is when the array has 1 no elements
2/9/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It will always run n times
2/9/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: not if the array is empty
2/9/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah but you don't have to argue best case ;)
2/9/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: true
2/9/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If the array is empty, n=0
2/9/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: so it will still run n times
2/9/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Tik 'm aan
2/9/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 🙏
2/9/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes, but that would make an array of infinite length the worst case for every algorithm. If only we could express the running time regardless of input length 🤔
2/9/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I knoe
2/9/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: knoe
2/9/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: know
2/9/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 🐄?
2/9/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: that's why in this case it doesn't matter
2/9/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes
2/9/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it's the same
2/9/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: so it doesn't exist
2/9/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: roses are red
violets are blue
if you assume false
then everything is true
2/9/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So we should use the Theta notation here?
2/9/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: MOM, GET THE CAMERA
2/9/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: This should be a shirt
2/9/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: yes
2/9/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: use theta

2/9/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, yes, lets stop spamming
2/9/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: when analysing runtime you only have to show the time of each element in the algorithm and calculate the runtime right? you don't have to do anything else with it?
2/9/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: i guess so
2/9/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: and the total running time

2/9/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Does anyone know if we get free printcredit every year?
2/9/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I believe So
2/9/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not sure tho
2/9/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So basically it's free printing
2/9/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I printed a shitton for two people and still have 12 euros
2/9/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is there a place with the formulas for specific sums. Like the one for the sum of 1 till n= n(n+1)/2. Because there are some more right ?
2/9/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ah that's nice
2/9/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Thanks!
2/9/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
2/9/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wikipedia
2/9/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It has the full list with all standard sums
2/9/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh lol, alright :p thanks
2/9/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: How long did the grading of the data structures test take? I'm probably asking an already answered question, but couldn't find it in this app
2/9/17, 19:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: i guess sunday 23:55
2/9/17, 19:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: so nobody can share answers
2/9/17, 19:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: that 110% right'
2/9/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh so nobody has the answers yet
2/9/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: They would give it back at Wednesday right?
2/9/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But you can't keep ondoing it until you have a 10 then 😪
2/9/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You mean the Quiz1 thingy?
2/9/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I got my grade after 15 minutes or so
2/9/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: yeah
2/9/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh, alright
2/9/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Should be fine then
2/9/17, 20:31 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: wow, you got it that fast? I made it wednesday afternoon, and still haven't seen any grade on canvas yet
2/9/17, 20:32 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: All grades are muted now
2/9/17, 20:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh dear
2/9/17, 20:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is not good
2/9/17, 20:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Does that mean we're not gonna get second chances anymore?
2/9/17, 20:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: While they stated last submission counts
2/9/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Arthur even clearly said it'd be the same as calculus :(
2/9/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And you get second chances there
2/9/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: You don't get grades
2/9/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: You can try as often as you want
2/9/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nahw
2/9/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But for calculus you see what you get wrong
2/9/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They don't tell you that for Data
2/9/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So it's not the same idea
2/9/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: I believe modeling test have the same set up as calculus right
2/9/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
2/9/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: Where you can try again and you know what you did wrong
2/9/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: Not per se for data structures
2/9/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Partial differentiation was easier than it seemed
2/9/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
2/9/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: does anyone know how to rewrite this into a polynomial
2/9/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: cant find any summation thing on wikipedia for this
2/9/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: log n + n^3
2/9/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: the sum to the right is n*n
2/9/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: then with the sum to the left of that, you do that times n too
2/9/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so you get n^3
2/9/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Anyone else having trouble submitting on Canvas?
2/9/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: how do you know this?
2/9/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: summation rules
2/9/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: basically what is in the top line of the sigma, you do that times what is to the right of it(at least, that's what I think it should be)
2/9/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: but j=i
2/9/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: it would be n^2 if i=1
2/9/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: *if j=1
2/9/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I think I get it already
2/9/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: ty
2/9/17, 21:29 - Reinier Schmiermann: It is log n + 1/2*n²(n+1)
2/9/17, 21:30 - Reinier Schmiermann: The right sum equals (n-i+1)n, not  n*n
2/9/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yeah but because you can ignore constants it doesn't really make a difference right?
2/9/17, 21:34 - Reinier Schmiermann: No, the final
2/9/17, 21:34 - Reinier Schmiermann: awnser is the same
2/9/17, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Did you came up with the polynomial just by reasoning or can you find that one anywhere?
2/9/17, 21:40 - Reinier Schmiermann: The rightmost sum contains n-i+1 terms, and all these terms equal n, so  this sum is (n-i+1)n
2/9/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I get that part
2/9/17, 21:41 - Reinier Schmiermann: Because n is a constant, we can get it out of the sum, so we get the sum over i from (n-i+1)
2/9/17, 21:44 - Reinier Schmiermann: If i goes from 1 to n, these terms go from n to, so this sum equals the sum of k with k from 1 to n, this equals ½n(n+1)
2/9/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: ahh I get it
2/9/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: thank you!!
2/9/17, 21:44 - Reinier Schmiermann: Np
2/9/17, 21:56 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: np complete

2/9/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: The summation yields 4
2/9/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You know that that is one from last year right?
2/9/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yes I do

2/10/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Y
2/10/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Leg is half ko
2/10/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Walking is hard
2/10/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Bit
2/10/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: For this i csn try to walk
2/10/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wth
2/10/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hakan no
2/10/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Yeah
2/10/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Fuck this shit right
2/10/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I even tried registering next to you
2/10/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Wtf
2/10/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I didnt check my mail for 2 days
2/10/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: 2 days
2/10/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: And im deregistered for the course
2/10/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: did you go to the lectures?
2/10/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you registered during te lectures didnt you
2/10/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: We only had 1
2/10/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ohhh shit that was on your phona
2/10/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Or 2
2/10/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Yeah
2/10/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and it did t work
2/10/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: for embedded systems, we dont have connectors for the motors. does anyone have them? they are not on our parts list
2/10/17, 10:20 - Luke Houben: Isn't that just cable A
2/10/17, 10:20 - Luke Houben: 2 connector to 2 seperate outputs?
2/10/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: we have loose cables
2/10/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: without connectors
2/10/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: we have to build the types ourselves
2/10/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: but we dont have the connector thingies
2/10/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: and they are also not on the parts list
2/10/17, 10:21 - Luke Houben: Oh wth we had them completed in the box
2/10/17, 10:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: We did too
2/10/17, 10:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Completed ones
2/10/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Does anyone know if there are meetings for hypermedia today?
2/10/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: i heard from a couple of people there were
2/10/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We just mailed eachother and met/discussed somewhere
2/10/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So if you agreed to meet, then you had a meeting
2/10/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you didn't then you did not :p
2/10/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: wrong group wtf
2/10/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: sorry
2/10/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
2/10/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Nice
2/10/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's detecting the chip color quite fast btw
2/10/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Wow
2/10/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thats pretty nice
2/10/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Are you guys done now?
2/10/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So you guys are done?
2/10/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: The fuck
2/10/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Group 1 confirmed
2/10/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Already?
2/10/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Group 20 bitches
2/10/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: group 20 in da house
2/10/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 83411377‬: Woot woot
2/10/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What are you guys gonna do now,
2/10/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Party hard and drink harder
2/10/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: group 1 is making a tic tac toe machine
2/10/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: as in you play tic tac toe vs the machine?
2/10/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: jup
2/10/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: we are trying at least haah
2/10/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: haha
2/10/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: If its a 3x3 playing field it should be doable
2/10/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: The AI atleast
2/10/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: idk about the machine lol
2/10/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yeah its tricky
2/10/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: You can just make a list with best moves
2/10/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: And we were happy that we made our motor work 😖
2/10/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: the sorting machine looks really good tho
2/10/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: i wrote a tic tac toe AI on my calculator a while ago, its pretty easy since there are a few moves
2/10/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: but dropping the discs in the right square is pretty hard i think
2/10/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: GL tho
2/10/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thanks we need it haha
2/10/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: And we were happy that we had almost all components
2/10/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Hardest part might be dropping only one
2/10/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: ^
2/10/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Thats quite a complicated mechanism
2/10/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: So
2/10/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: How many virgins did you sacrifice to get your whole project done in just 4 days
2/10/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 46247309‬: Only themselves
2/10/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Nice
2/10/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Just a couple of our souls were enough for the glorious being called Satan
2/10/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Satan sounds logical
2/10/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Sinds we are technically building a segregationmachine
2/10/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 14336980‬: Anyone know the virgin to difficulty conversion? I'm only making the sorting machine so won't need as many
2/10/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: virgin to difficulty conversion
2/10/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What the heck is that :p
2/10/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 14336980‬: Make the connection
2/10/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 14336980‬: I cba
2/10/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The amount of virgins you need to sacrifice to go get your machine working depends on how complicated your machine is
2/10/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Doe godverkkdomme normaal
2/10/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Tering zeg
2/10/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Facking nu al
2/10/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Zijn jullie dat groepje met een facking 11 gemiddeld of wat
2/10/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Rustig Stef
2/10/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Een 11 lijkt me een beetje onmogelijk Stef
2/10/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
2/10/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 14336980‬: Lol stef
2/10/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
2/10/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: We zijn groepje 20 schat
2/10/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: We hebben gemiddeld een 6e
2/10/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: 😂😂🎉
2/10/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Hahahaha xD
2/10/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: When You are gonna propose Your idea for an alternative assignment, are You just going to show Your machine?
2/10/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: we(group 20) are not going to hand in an idea for an alternative assignment, we are content with our working sorting machine
2/10/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Is it pen proof though?
2/10/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: What happens when you pull out a wire and put the pen in front of the light?
2/10/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How can you already even work on the machine, you have to go through the whole V-model process
2/10/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Ours is pretty far too though
2/10/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Whole other sorting system though
2/10/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Like the simplicity in yours a lott
2/10/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: "Reject your reality and substitute our own" -Adam savage
2/10/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: 👆🏻
2/10/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I like his name😂
2/10/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Our entire sorting part is almost done now, but we are making a sorter into a calculator, such that we can make binary calculations
2/10/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys
2/10/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It has been 1 week
2/10/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes
2/10/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You've got 8
2/10/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: we're doing the same, but we're doing it so much better
2/10/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Are you actually doing the same ?
2/10/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I don't mind who of us does it better
2/10/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: yes
2/10/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But it is less cool of it is the same
2/10/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hmmm
2/10/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: we didn't steal each others ideas
2/10/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: No I know
2/10/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But how are you going to display the output for example
2/10/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: With discs ?
2/10/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Of the display
2/10/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Or*
2/10/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah well, I just hope we don't accidentally make the same machine lol
2/10/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Even if we do, It doesn't matter tbh
2/10/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: haha
2/10/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: like exactly the same 😂
2/10/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: even the building parts
2/10/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: That would be amazing
2/10/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: 😂
2/10/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: try explaining that to Cuijpers
2/10/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Not trying to make it any worse or anything, but we were thinking of creating a binary calculator as well... Woops!
2/10/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: lol
2/10/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: 😂😂😂
2/10/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: we've considered building a turing machine
2/10/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: then decided not to
2/10/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: well, I think it doesn't matter, multiple groups also just build the sorting machine. it's not so much about what you build. it's more about working together and group dynamics
2/10/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: With like 20 groups you will always have the same designs
2/10/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Especially because we all have the same parts and thus are "forced" into a general direction
2/10/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: But advanced features :)
2/10/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Premium™
2/10/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Premium en co.
2/10/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: No you are right, tbh I am having a lot of fun on this project
2/10/17, 18:54 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yeah it's a very friendly environment to learn team work and a lot of fun
2/10/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Tom, our group is like 50% shits and giggles, and the rest is hard work
2/10/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But it works :)
2/10/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: so.. 25% shits, 25% giggles and 50% concentrated power of work?
2/10/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Not sure we have a shits and giggles formula for that
2/10/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: we have progressed quite far already, so if we finish it before the 8 weeks deadline, I guess we'll just take those days off entirely :D
2/10/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Can I use for the Data Structures Assignment that nlog(n) is always quicker than log(n) ?
2/10/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or wait, is it
2/10/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Isn't it the other way around
2/10/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 42082100‬: yes
2/10/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah log(n) is quicker right
2/10/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 42082100‬: nlogn is quicker
2/10/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: but why.. if n gets larger you basically get the same log(n) but multiply that with n
2/10/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So you increase it?
2/10/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Our sorting machine will have an emoji bar and is therefore superior and 1000$ more expensive than one without
2/10/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Log n increases slower then n log n
2/10/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Right 😂?
2/10/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So log(n) is the quicker runtime?
2/10/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah I thought so
2/10/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yes
2/10/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: oh just like the new macbook storm?
2/10/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: don't forget about the orange with the bite out of it, that increases it by another $900!
2/10/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: It has quicker runtime
2/10/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But he said this, @31644497802
2/10/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
2/10/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: nlog n is growing faster, but thats not the same as faster runtime
2/10/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no
2/10/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I said log(n) has the faster runtime
2/10/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Nah, this is the iSort, it doesn't sort fast or efficient but it's shiny and expensive and therefore better
2/10/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: ooh I see my bad ye ur right XD
2/10/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahaha
2/10/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No worries, I get distracted by these things every damn time
2/10/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Like copied from the open source bogosort, but then made closed source.
2/10/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: but does it have a headphone jack
2/10/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: ???
2/10/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Do you guys suppose we fuck over next year's students by showing that the project can easily be done within 2 weeks?
2/10/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Yes
2/10/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: No, ours uses the new magic ifrequency modulation that transmits waves of music into the air
2/10/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Never been done before

2/10/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: 😂😂
2/10/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: We call it iFM
2/10/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: wow thats so revolutionary
2/10/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: iFM radio is the new*** way to listen to music

2/10/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Tried Google already?
2/10/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You do this:
2/10/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: 2^{thing}
2/10/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: The {} are used for everything
2/10/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Yes
2/10/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Worked, thanks 👍🏻

2/10/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: careful*
2/10/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Because that's how plagiarism happens.
2/10/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: @31630168397 @31634614111
2/10/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Thing is, if you share it with someone it can even be seen as plagiarism
2/10/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That's what happend with Martin and Tim indeed
2/10/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which really fucking sucks
2/10/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And is really bullshitty
2/10/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: How?
2/10/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Oh damn, in which course did that happen?
2/10/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: FUNdamentals
2/10/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Hahahha martin tim

2/10/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: That really fucking sucks indeed
2/10/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: May I have the full story?
2/10/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If Martin and Tim don't mind I'd tell it but not without their confirmation ;d
2/10/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 🙊
2/10/17, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hi I'm Martin please tell the story
2/10/17, 23:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No you're Rick
2/10/17, 23:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Try again later when I might be drunk
2/10/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: It sucked mayor dicks thats what
2/10/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: Basically a forced resit
2/10/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: And they were being "nice"
2/10/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: What happened?
2/10/17, 23:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wow indeed, how did you get to that point of discussion
2/10/17, 23:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What did you guys do :o
2/11/17, 00:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I guess somebody was lazy when copying homeqork and didnt change anything ?
2/11/17, 00:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Literaly i see mo other way of getting caught with copied homework
2/11/17, 00:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So yes indeed boys and grolls dont share because there is atleast one of 300 people that doesnt care 🐔👌
2/11/17, 00:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Rhymes lime aminem
2/11/17, 00:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 👴🏿🙏🏿
2/11/17, 04:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I give permission to tell it
2/11/17, 04:07 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Don't have the time / don't want to tell it myself tho
2/11/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Guys, in assembly, can you use BRS in a subroutine or will that go wrong?
2/11/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Should be fine
2/11/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: my best guess is that it will go to another subroutine
2/11/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Rts once will go back to that subroutine then rts again will go back to the main
2/11/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: so it will have more layers
2/11/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Kaythanks
2/11/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Do you get an email verification if your book has arrived at gewis ?
2/11/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
2/11/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah okay thanks, pretty obvious actually 😂

2/11/17, 15:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 👌🙃🗡
2/11/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I think everything will be checked after the first week
2/11/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: The grading method of the quiz is last attempt
2/11/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I guess to avoid plagiarism you can only check it after tomorrow
2/11/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I think it's really dumb that it is graded for highest attempt, while you can't check if you had it correct or not
2/11/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: is it highest attempt or last attempt, last one right?
2/11/17, 15:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yes
2/11/17, 15:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: guys how do we ""sign up for pairs for data stuctures in canvas""
2/11/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: go to people
2/11/17, 15:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I don't see nayoption anywhere in data structures in canvas to do that
2/11/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: and then click on the group tab
2/11/17, 15:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ok
2/11/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Pick a group with 0 people
2/11/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And let your groupmate sign up for the same group number
2/11/17, 15:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oki tnx
2/11/17, 15:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <#
2/11/17, 15:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ❤
2/11/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We should mail 'em about thi asap

2/11/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: It says "return outside method"
2/11/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You don't have a main() method
2/11/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, what the hell is going on over here
2/11/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
2/11/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ohhh haha this is wrong
2/11/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yes should have put () 😅
2/11/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Thx rick
2/11/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: also you have to return something outside of all if statements
2/11/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: return 0 or something
2/11/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yup just put it now 😅
2/11/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Thx
2/11/17, 23:43 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Another mistake ; binary search takes sorted arrays 😅
2/11/17, 23:43 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Haha, you could make a binary sort and search
2/11/17, 23:44 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: first sort then do binary search
2/11/17, 23:44 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I will try that :D
Sounds better
2/11/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: To save yourself the effort, Java probably has a built in sorting function
2/11/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So you don't have to implement the algorithm yourself
2/12/17, 00:13 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I don't think he is doing it for the sake of sorting an actual array
2/12/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I am just trying to learn the code without memorising it 😅
But thx anyhow
2/12/17, 01:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Mo check out these sites: http://algo-visualizer.jasonpark.me/#path=sorting/selection/basic

2/12/17, 01:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: ^ really good site
2/12/17, 01:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They both give quite good explenations of the searching algo's their runtimes and on top of that
2/12/17, 01:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: A nice visualizations
2/12/17, 01:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: zation*
2/12/17, 01:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which is really nice
2/12/17, 01:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And looks good
2/12/17, 01:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And is informative
2/12/17, 01:24 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yup it is useful 
Thx @31643222030
2/12/17, 02:48 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Ok
2/12/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Wat ok jij ons?!
2/12/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hi there!
As you might have seen the amount of questions in the various group chats has been steadily increasing, and with that the amount of repeated questions as well. Jort came with the idea of a stack overflow like environment in which we could ask questions, search them and give answers in good way. So we got together and are proudly presenting https://cs-students.nl/. You can ask questions and upload files. More information is available on the site (which also looks damn nice on mobile), when making an account just make sure to use your TU/e email adress and start asking questions! (Btw the SSL certificate is still settling down, if you get a message about the site being insecure give it a few days, we can ensure it is secure at the moment ;) )

2/12/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Nice work! While it is still getting started and people are creating their accounts, I'll ask one final question in this chat! ^^

For exercise 4 of DS, is it enough to give the constants? Or do you also have to construct a proof to ensure that with your constant, the formal definition always holds?
2/12/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: This is how I did a similair exercise for Fundamentals last quartile:

2/12/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And this is how I did that same exercise:

2/12/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Very clear, thanks!
2/12/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What is the filename guideline of handing in Datastructures assignments?
2/12/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Daan
2/12/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Remeber what we have been working on for the past few weeks
2/12/17, 14:40 - Luke Houben: There's a guideline on that?
2/12/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: whoops, solid point Jort
2/12/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
2/12/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: try firefox
2/12/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I had this problem on chrome anyway
2/12/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and switching worked for me
2/12/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yes, worked just fine for me on chrome
2/12/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thank you, this worked
2/12/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good to see the people who teach us what we need to do use stuff that does not work properly
2/12/17, 15:08 - Bart van Dooren: Is there a way to turn down the notifications i get from confluence received 4 mails in 15 min 🙃
2/12/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Profile > Settings > Email
2/12/17, 15:10 - Luke Houben: Or bottom of every email
2/12/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'll see if I can disable them server wide, thanks for notifying me
2/12/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: <Media omitted>
2/12/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys is this enough ?
2/12/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: As proof ?
2/12/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: @31628151420
2/12/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It's correct
2/12/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: maybe explain everything a bit more in detail
2/12/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: This is how i did it at fundamentals
2/12/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: In the DS slides, the 0 as the lower boundary isn't mentioned, right? You don't have to specify that do you?
2/12/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Hmm
2/12/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: This is the formula i found out
2/12/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Btw where are those DS slides ?
2/12/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: canvas
2/12/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: when the fk are we gonna get our physics results
2/12/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: it has been almost 3 weeks
2/12/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: They have three weeks to grade them!
2/12/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Last quartile they used the full three weeks every time haha!
2/12/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: So I think this wednesday!
2/12/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Is b false guys
2/12/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: you mean question 5?
2/12/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Question 4b
2/12/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: 4b is indeed false
2/12/17, 16:45 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: 4d is also false right ?
2/12/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: 4d is correct i thougt
2/12/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
2/12/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I thought 4d is incorrect/false as well
2/12/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I'd expand on that proof a bit more Leon
2/12/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it seems a bit short
2/12/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: At least show that c_1n^3 <= n^3 - 3n and n^3 - 3n <= c_2 n^3
2/12/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: And how you got the n_0
2/12/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Because this is like picking some random numbers and saying IT HOLDS
2/12/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Which is not how a proof works
2/12/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Ill look into 4d and my proofs a bit more then
2/12/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
2/12/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: 4b and d are false
2/12/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: How did u guys do e ?
2/12/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: proof that it is transitive
2/12/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: What jort said is correct
2/12/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Where can I find an example with a false proof of asymptotic notation??
2/12/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I don't know where you can find an example, but if you can prove O(logn) for 4b, then you have shown that omega(nlogn) is false
2/12/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Can I just choose a big n0 and prove it doesn't hold?
2/12/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You got it
2/12/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: No wait
2/12/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I misread what you just sent
2/12/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Try what I sent initially
2/12/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Yeah I'll try that thanks!
2/12/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 13850516‬: To upload the assignment in Canvas, do we just put it in our group homework folder?
2/12/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If you're in a group, just upload it as usual
2/12/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: One of you
2/12/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: see https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/questions/6815875/what-is-the-guideline-for-handing-in-datastructures-assignments 🙂
2/12/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 13850516‬: Alright, thanks
2/12/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fucking awesome
2/12/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Those that haven't yet registered at cs-students.nl may encounter their validation email ending up in the spam folder due to the large amount of registrations we have had in a short time span
2/12/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬ changed this group's icon
2/12/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Updated the old SF/s logo to the TU/e colors
2/12/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Better!
2/12/17, 18:49 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: wait how exactly is 4d false?
2/12/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: That whole thing can be rewritten to 1, and 1 is constant while log(n) is increasing, so 1 is not part of the set of all things growing at least as fast as log(n)
2/12/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
2/12/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: dividing by n gives n
2/12/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: not 1
2/12/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Try wolfram alpha or symbolab
2/12/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: This is the crucial part: log((2^(log (n)+1))/n) = log((n*2)/n)
2/12/17, 18:54 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: 2^log(n) = n, 2^1 = 2
2/12/17, 18:54 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: So 2^log(n)+1 = n+2
2/12/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: n*2
2/12/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: not n+2
2/12/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yeah i see where i messed up
2/12/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: the *n should be *2 in my calculation
2/12/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Okay nice
2/12/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: ye
2/12/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: where do i find the slides from lecture data structures
2/12/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: They're on canvas

2/12/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You have log n debt
2/12/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: depth*
2/12/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: That ^
2/12/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ahhh

2/12/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: 👌🏻👌🏻 got it
2/12/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Guys results of physics B are on oase

2/12/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Finger in the arse
2/12/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: just drink some water while heaving your head upside down
2/12/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: works 100%
2/12/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: just hang yourself
2/12/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Eat straight up peanut butter works well too

2/12/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I thought most of us did physics b? Or isnt that the default one 😂
2/12/17, 22:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: nope, A
2/12/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Alright mb

2/12/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But yeah Thorn
2/12/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Thorn :p
2/12/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Ruben was Thorn apart by the choices
2/12/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I know but when you look at it quickly it could also be Thom ;D
2/12/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 😂😂😂
2/12/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: That does happen quite often, sometimes even after i ask if they mean thorn
2/12/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I know Thorn ;) He's one of the guys who's also quite enthusiastic about cars
2/12/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Exacly :D
2/12/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Tell me about your favorite car
2/12/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 3rd hour starts at 10:45
2/12/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We might wanna move this convo though guys
2/12/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Thanks! And storm not the right group to do so 😉
2/12/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I actually want to know what's hot in the car world tbh, apart from the engine ofc
2/12/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Spam=kick 'n stuff

2/13/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: still no certificates
2/13/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There are
2/13/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just not visible yet for everyone
2/13/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The site has better security than rabobank has op het moment
2/13/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Has anyone else contacted the DataStructures staff yet regarding the fact the Quiz doesn't give you any feedback at all?
2/13/17, 16:51 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: has anyone contacted the Data Structures staff regarding their slides being fucked up ?
2/13/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Is this regarding to Dipsy being spelled as Dispy?
2/13/17, 16:56 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: no, i'm talking about the slides with the master theorem, where the writing is not aligned properly
2/13/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay I just emailed Arthur regarding DataStructures Quizzes
2/13/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
2/13/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah that sounds about right
2/13/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well that's your answer to question 1 then haha
2/13/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I assume distinct elements means they can't be the same?
2/13/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
2/13/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
2/13/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: B because it makes sense but A because we could also make a nonsense min-heap and this nice array while it doesn't make sense
2/13/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
2/13/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: for this one it would fit
2/13/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Got that as well
2/13/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In doubt as well ?
2/13/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Nope
2/13/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I am pretty sure it is correct
2/13/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I think its B
2/13/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I think so too

2/13/17, 18:01 - Julian Smits: anyone knows this one?
2/13/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 12026240‬: I think its d
2/13/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 12026240‬: Its a correct max heap and values are still on the same side of the root
2/13/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: d
2/13/17, 18:08 - Julian Smits: thanks

2/13/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: what did you ask him?
2/13/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: In that case we should just put them on the new site :p
I mean why would they not give the answers anyway
2/13/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Whether it would work the same as Quiz 1 did for us Stef
2/13/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They muted all grades
2/13/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So you don't get any feedback anymore
2/13/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think this isn't a good idea since that could be a weird form of fraud
2/13/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We can just share them here
2/13/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then why can it not be A?
2/13/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or does the 2 in the top automatically go for the 36 on the right for the build-max-heap command
2/13/17, 18:49 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: guys did any of you chose an elective for 4th quartile that is different than human technology interaction
2/13/17, 18:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yesh
2/13/17, 18:49 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: yea

2/13/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The answers are NOT at the same letter for all of us

2/13/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: do u guys know something easy other than human technology interaction (i already chose that one)
2/13/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAJ
2/13/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: and i think organization one is only in dutch

2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: I think there was someone else
2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: probably
2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Dont they upload them all at the same time?
2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: there was a lot more people than 3
2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: okay
2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: max had a lower grade for his resit and it is uploaded at his results
2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: so dimitar dont freak out yet
2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Isnt it like filling them all in and pressing submit?
2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what
2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: lol
2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i dont think so
2/14/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I didnt even have a resit
2/14/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Thomas who even are you
2/14/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: 🤔maybe youre not the only max🤔
2/14/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: yeah max the world doesn't revolve around you
2/14/17, 10:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: To everyone who wants to panic me dont worry you cant
2/14/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh damn
2/14/17, 10:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Last time i had 2.2
2/14/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: thanks for explaining pim and stijn
2/14/17, 10:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And this time everything i did is working as intended
2/14/17, 10:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I did all but bouncers from 3 so i am expecting more than 2.2
2/14/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Maybe you did them al in the wrong way?
2/14/17, 10:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So eat shut haters
2/14/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Like didnt look at recursion and shit
2/14/17, 10:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Maybe but how do they work then?
2/14/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: he eats haters
2/14/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: shut up

2/14/17, 10:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How are they working when i use recursion then
2/14/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i did recursion and everything before that and couple monsters after it
2/14/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: and got 5.3
2/14/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: bulshit
2/14/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So dimi
2/14/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah u can check if the program is working u know
2/14/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: She did everything and got 5.3
2/14/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: im gona check my mstakes

2/14/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: 🙆
2/14/17, 11:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Spoke to hyeeevees huben while getting fontys adds from roel bruh
2/14/17, 11:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Aparently they upload them in batches and there is also delay
2/14/17, 11:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And not
2/14/17, 11:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: At the same time
2/14/17, 11:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also grade is always upleaded no matter the result
2/14/17, 11:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And no its a fresh grade they dont update your last one
2/14/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: and are they putting it up even if it didnt improve from your last grade?
2/14/17, 11:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes
2/14/17, 11:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So for anyone wondering it might take time
2/14/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys for the PWM is it true that you're still sending like 12v to it? But for instance only half the time so it counts as 6v?
2/14/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because that makes literally no sense at all imho
2/14/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 6.1 programming
2/14/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: LEKKER SANDER, IK HOU VAN JE!
2/14/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Stuur me dan een roos de volgende keer verdomme man
2/14/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: hhahahah
2/14/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Sorry schat, maar jij weet het al, en ik dacht zo kan ik de liefde die jij mij geeft doorgeven aan meer mensen.
2/14/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 😘
2/14/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: ^
2/14/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm not understand how it would work with the motor because you'd still be sending the full 12v to it half of the time
2/14/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Or can I just send like .5 to one of the h-bridges and that'd be like half positive?
2/14/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah just do pwm to not overload it
2/14/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So like sending 1 to the h-bridge for 0.5s will make it 6v?
2/14/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ty for answering btw
2/14/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: if i blow up i can blame maas right
2/14/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: No
2/14/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: You can blame the guide :p
2/14/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: you ARE our guide
2/14/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Haha, you sure you wanna follow someone with 5 credits?
2/14/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You only have 5??
2/14/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Yeah, but I think a lot more after I get all my Shit back :p
2/14/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: But I was ill last quartile for 3 weeks and therefore missed 0.4 on both calculus and lst
2/14/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Last quartile?
2/14/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: First you mean?
2/14/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, he means first, because I was in his group there
2/14/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I just hope you passed all your resits maas :)
2/14/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Yeah first
2/14/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Haha thanks
2/14/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I fear for calculus though
2/14/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i fear for everything
2/14/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This.. brother.. this
2/14/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Makes sense.. small dogs make the most noise
2/14/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i fear for all grades***
2/14/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh btw, if anyone, no matter who it is, says calculus is online while it is not, I will feed them their family members trough their anus
2/14/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: kinky
2/14/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: Guess what's online?
2/14/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: Absolutely fucking nothing
2/14/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: Because fuck the TUe
2/14/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 46247309‬: The deadline is 3 weeks right?
2/14/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: jup tomorrow tnw
2/14/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 46247309‬: So are there any consequences if they are late?
2/14/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Nope
2/14/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And it does happen
2/14/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Alot
2/14/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I heard they increase ur point by one
2/14/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Ur grade
2/14/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: Lol no
2/14/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: From what I know the three week deadline is actually in the NL law
2/14/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But as long as no one makes a problem no one will pursue that law
2/14/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 46247309‬: Wow
2/14/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 46247309‬: I had to hand in a research paper for Creative Thinking about 4 weeks ago
2/14/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Try to google it
2/14/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 46247309‬: And they were all like "If you are even just 2 minutes too late that's too bad"
2/14/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so guys
2/14/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: do we all agree to press charges if they are more than 3 days late?
2/14/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Lets do it
2/14/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which floor in Meta is the desk where they have whiteboard markers again
2/14/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 4 or 5?
2/14/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What the heck
2/14/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Where was it
2/14/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Is there a floor where they hand out markers?
2/14/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No there is a service desk for the top floors (above 3)
2/14/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And they ave markers there I heard
2/14/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: You can buy markers on 3rd floor
2/14/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: At the student shop
2/14/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah you can buy them way too expensive from the library shop as well
2/14/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: True
2/14/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I just want to draw something on the whiteboard in my reserved room
2/14/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: It gets even better! Officially, according to the OER, everything has to be graded before the next graded assignment starts.
2/14/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: so as long as they don't post the data structures grades they are fine
2/14/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I already have one data structure grade
2/14/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: No, it's per course! For example programming? They graded our assignment after we started a new one. Officially, that could never be the case!
2/14/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: how?
2/14/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Oh lel, they removed my grade
2/14/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: But last wednesday i had 8 out of 8 for the first quiz
2/14/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah that
2/14/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What the heck.. So please tell me how we can pursue this to make their deadlines feel like pressure to them as well?
2/14/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Where can we file mass-complaints about this
2/14/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Student politics groups
2/14/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Like?
2/14/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: No idea what they are called
2/14/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: dimi you got your grade?

2/14/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Is physics grade on oase?
2/14/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: no?
2/14/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yeh
2/14/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: for me at least
2/14/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: in DataStructures, when they ask for upper and lower bound, does it suffice to give an answer in Theta notation?
2/14/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Ah yeah it is..
2/14/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: whatchu got?
2/14/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: no physics for me :(
2/14/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 4.1...
2/14/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: ahh noo

2/14/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Would they mind fucking sending an email
2/14/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: i have no physics result on my oase
2/14/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I dont have physics either
2/14/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Oh weird

2/14/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: for data structures assignment 2 exercise 4. you only have to use the master theorem and give the big o, theta or omega right?
2/14/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fuck that man haha, I got my third "missing 0.2 on final to pass course" haha
2/14/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Thats what I did?
2/14/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: or also show the c1 c2 and n0 for the bounds
2/14/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Since you use the master theorem, that has a proof, you probably don't have to proof the result again
2/14/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: physics is online on oase!!!
2/14/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: no joke

2/14/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Wait didnt they say that the intermediate test doesnt count if its makes you fail
2/14/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then you need to pass the resit as well
2/14/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: for the same idea
2/14/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: only if you have scored over a 5.5 in both the resit and the non-resit
2/14/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: i believe

2/14/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: I know

2/14/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: me and @31681422900 tried to do substitution
2/14/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it lead to suicide
2/14/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: me too
2/14/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: it doesn't work
2/14/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: you don't have the constants
2/14/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: maybe use a heap?
2/14/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: or call Arthur the heapspert
2/14/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Recursion tree would work
2/14/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you can assume that T(1) = 1 as the x^2 for 0 is 0
2/14/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You'll get something with signa
2/14/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: *sigma
2/14/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: more like a recursion line in this case
2/14/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: jort can you explain?
2/14/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Indeed a line ;)
2/14/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: So, we have this function that call's itself to be solved. when it does so it reduces the input by 1, it (trivially) does this n times, so you have to execute the whole algorithm n times. Given that the other bit takes n^2 time we can assume (guess) that the running time will be O(n^3)
2/14/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: this has to then be proven by induction
2/14/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but I didn't get further than that
2/14/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: but how do you know T (1) = 1
2/14/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I don't think you should do it with t(1)
2/14/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But t(2)
2/14/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Would you mind moving this question to cs-students.nl I can answer in more detail there and other people who will have the same question in a few days can easily view the answer
2/14/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Because it's constant for =< 2
2/14/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Just what I wanted to say Jort
2/14/17, 23:33 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: @31623837581 is the verification still not there?
2/14/17, 23:33 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: No, and I found out why
2/14/17, 23:33 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: hold on, let me show you
2/14/17, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I still can't enter
2/14/17, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Our certificate authority got distrusted by chrome and mozilla due to some weird chinese related incident (https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/10/24/distrusting-new-wosign-and-startcom-certificates/) They are currently fighting it and I hope our certificates will be valid again
2/14/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: On chrome you can bypass this message, on firefox you have to temporarily disable your certificate checking
2/14/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so whenhow will I be able to bypass it on firefex
2/14/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: nvm
2/14/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: you answered already
2/14/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: @31623837581 why don't you use (temporary) let's encrypt certificates
2/14/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: They're free
2/14/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Please, let it be know, *your data is still encrypted and not at risk* The only problem is the validation of our certificate (I.E. are we who we say we are)
2/14/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And also work very well!!
2/14/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: We have looked into them, but last time we tried setting them up it fucked some shit up causing us to have had to roll back to a backup
2/14/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: This was tried but doesn't work
2/14/17, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: On Safari on iPhone you can't open the site. It just immediately stops loading so that's a bit annoying now
2/14/17, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: So I have to use laptop
2/14/17, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: that is indeed an issue
2/14/17, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ah okay
2/14/17, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Hope it'll be fixed soon
2/14/17, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Because the site is really a great idea!
2/14/17, 23:38 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Thank you, Very glad you guys like it
2/14/17, 23:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: again, this ssl issue will have to be resolved at some point, but preferably in a way we don't have to restore the server to a backup

2/15/17, 09:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I see some fucked up difficult formulas on that last slide I sent and no idea how to apply them
2/15/17, 09:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: some powers of logs and what not
2/15/17, 09:47 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Log base 2(4) = 2
2/15/17, 09:48 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: So its n^2 + n^3
2/15/17, 09:48 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: So theta(n^3)
2/15/17, 09:48 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Correct me if im wrong someone
2/15/17, 09:48 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it's the 3rd rule by thw looks of it
2/15/17, 09:49 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: I just send a mail to arthur. From now on you can review your data structures quizzes via canvas
2/15/17, 09:49 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(n^3) we get that a = 4, b = 2, so log4 = 2. Because n^2 < n^3 means that n^3 "wins" so function is upper bounded by n^3
2/15/17, 09:49 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Rule 2 right?

2/15/17, 09:51 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: f(n), which is n^3 and thus 'wins' from n^2 as claudiu nicely explained above
2/15/17, 09:51 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: and the 3rd rule states that it's theta(f(n))

2/15/17, 09:52 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: what was the distribution of the grade in CG again?
2/15/17, 09:52 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: cause it says i got a 5.0 for the final examination, i think
2/15/17, 09:53 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I got a 5 I think... (Which I would be happy with, because I had accepted my resit already) But after everyone trolling with fake announcements about grades that have been put online, I'm extra careful! ^^
2/15/17, 09:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i think it is
2/15/17, 09:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: but it says a 5 for me as well
2/15/17, 09:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: which is a bit strange
2/15/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: and theres no decimal as well
2/15/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: but getting a 5 is fine right for the final exa,m?
2/15/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yes at least a 5.0
2/15/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: ok, and how "heavy" do all the grades of CG count again?
2/15/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: cause if its something along the lines of 70/20/10 im fine
2/15/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: 50/40/10 right? And I don't think it shows a decimal for an integer! At least, I got a 5 for Calculus as well which also shows as '5' (not 5.0)
2/15/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: oh great!
2/15/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i dont know ^^
2/15/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: still have a 6 then :P
2/15/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I thought it was 40% for all the assignments and 10% for the intermediate!
2/15/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: 5.5 for the final cg holy Shit im so fucking happy 😭😭😭😭

2/15/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice
2/15/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lets go
2/15/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Where or how can I study for it though...
2/15/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that's a very good questions
2/15/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: were the tutor hours for data structures useful btw?
2/15/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: For 4d of DS, can we just assume that for n = 1 and n=2 the runtime is only  f👎
2/15/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: f( n)?
2/15/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no idea
2/15/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I find it useful, but it's up to you if you think that too
2/15/17, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: If there is someone is good at DS, can they help me with this question: cs-students.nl/display/SOF/questions/8585228/assignment-2-question-4-d
2/15/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Which audi do we have lecture?
2/15/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 1
2/15/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Not 8?
2/15/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: 8 is also a possibility I think
2/15/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Your choise
2/15/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: No
2/15/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: There is only one right now
2/15/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: It's mathematic thing only
2/15/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: There are quite some people in room 8
2/15/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: But no lecturer
2/15/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Well, there's only a few spaces left in 1, so if you want to be sure, hurry 😂
2/15/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lol
2/15/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No video there either?
2/15/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: nope
2/15/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: we're working on the homework right now because we couldn't enter the lecture
2/15/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: There are people on the stairs
2/15/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Does vollecollegezalen.nl exist?
2/15/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
2/15/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think they hoped more people would've chosen Fontys by now
2/15/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: can you add latex code to cs-students?
2/15/17, 12:08 - Kevin Jilissen: Yes
2/15/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Currently only math though
2/15/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So put text outside of the math block
2/15/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Unless you don't like spaces ofcoarse
2/15/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: how do I add a math block 😅
2/15/17, 12:11 - Luke Houben: \[( i think
2/15/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's listed on the example question
2/15/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But /[ and /( should work
2/15/17, 12:14 - Luke Houben: Oh yea that
2/15/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: do you type it in a code block?
2/15/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep!
2/15/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: it doesn't work
2/15/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Take a look at the example question
2/15/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I did
2/15/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Show me your question
2/15/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Like send a pic
2/15/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: <Media omitted>
2/15/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That's a code block not latex math block
2/15/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You should be able to insert an latex math block with /{
2/15/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The macro is also listed in the example question
2/15/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: you said I could put it in a code block
2/15/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I thought you ment the math block
2/15/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: <Media omitted>
2/15/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: still nothinf
2/15/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: nothing
2/15/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll look at it directly after this lecture for you
2/15/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You used the wrong slash
2/15/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: \{
2/15/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because I sent the wrong one
2/15/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But the correct way is also listed in the example question
2/15/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If you type in \{ or \[ you get either a math block or an math line
2/15/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: no, also tried that
2/15/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: doesn't work
2/15/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: oh now it suddenly works
2/15/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Strange, haven't done anything yet besides checking the macro's
2/15/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Can we check programming exams
2/15/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
2/15/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's mandatory for each course to offer the opportunity

2/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guys, for creating HTML and CSS in a team, which IDEA do you recommend for using in combination with GIT?
2/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: IDEA?
2/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: the idea of watching porn
2/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no
2/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but seriously
2/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: what is an IDEA
2/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Stef if you can't see something useful shut your trap
2/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: :p
2/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: say*
2/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Like Intellij or Netbeans was for Java
2/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: oh
2/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What is good to use with HTML and CSS in a team with GIT
2/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: just use NOTEPAD++
2/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is that connectable to git :p
2/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i dont know what git is
2/15/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Webstorm?
2/15/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: Atom?

2/15/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: (n/3)^2 = (n^2)/9 if you do that times 7 you get 7/9*cn^2
2/15/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, i get that
2/15/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: but why do they do 7*c*(n/3)^2
2/15/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: it's the recursive formula filled into f
2/15/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: to get to the awnser
2/15/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wait, i got it already
2/15/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Thanks

2/15/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That is the way I did it?
2/15/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: in the 3rd line. I'd put that f (n) = n^logb (a)
2/15/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We did it in a similar way
2/15/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Bit more text
2/15/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
2/15/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I think i put that on the 4th line right? to distinguish the case
2/15/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: oh wait i know what you mean, ill look into it
2/15/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: can you solve 4d with master theorem or only substitution
2/15/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: ?
2/15/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/questions/8585228/assignment-2-question-4-d
2/15/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: You don't have to use induction for 4d, right?
2/15/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: does anyone know how they pick c when using the substitution method?
2/15/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: You start writing your induction step with _c_ still in it, and then at the end you find that the last step only works for c >= 1 (or something), so you pick c = 1
2/15/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Geert has saved our asses
2/15/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thanks
2/15/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Geert?
2/15/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He answered the question on CSstudents in detail
2/15/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ah
2/15/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: @31623837581 "T(n)=T(n−1)+n^2. I have already found (and shown) that T(n)=O(n^3)" why are you expression it in big O and not in Theta? im confused because on the same exercise on the recursion page on canvas it explains the same function to be Theta(n^3)
2/15/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: because with substitution you have to guess a bound
2/15/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: and it's easier to guess upper or lower bound instead of both, other wise you have to be really sure you are corrext
2/15/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: so you only do one at a time?
2/15/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes
2/15/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: I can't get to cs-students.nl. My browser gives me a sec_error_revoked _certificate
2/15/17, 16:57 - Luke Houben: Try another browser

2/15/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: From there you can select 'still visit website'
2/15/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but that is advanced knowledge Martin

2/15/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: We were working in pavilion today on embedded systems and this group comes to us and asks: " could it be that we reserved this room? "  but I politely explained that we have this room for embedded systems. The left peacefully. Has anyone else experienced that two people reserved the same room? (Outside of data structures)
2/15/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Who in there right minds would reserve a room in the pavilion
2/15/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Those who are already there?
2/15/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: We don't have a room in MF and have to go to FACKING pavilion for embedded systems
2/15/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: So that's why
2/15/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 22540209‬: Some DBL Hypermedia groups also have rooms in Paviljoen
2/15/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We just reserve our own room in MF when we're not scheduled there
2/15/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 22540209‬: But i don't know if any are booked 'twice'
2/15/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Maybe it was their mistake idk but data structures did have double booked rooms and she (spekman) was pissed about it
2/15/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Were you in the room in the first 15 minutes of the DBL today?
2/15/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I always reserve a nice room
2/15/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If after the first 15 minutes after the start of the hour the room is empty, it gets set to free
2/15/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The standard reservations suck ass
2/15/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: (There literally walks someone around in paviljoen to check it)
2/15/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Paviljoen and then even those large halls with cardboard seperations with noise
2/15/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yes but during the break we were politely told to fuck off
2/15/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And this also happened in the second block, but they were nice enough to find a different place
2/15/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We had that as well
2/15/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The room was reserverd during the break
2/15/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Jep
2/15/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But we mailed cuijpers and I think(let's hope) he is gonna fix it
2/15/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: lol
2/15/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why would you even sit in those shitrooms at Paviljoen though
2/15/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There's lots of rooms available everywhere
2/15/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ikr
2/15/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I mailed cuijpers about it, and he asked the people from the desk at paviljoen about it, but I haven't gotten a response yet. Might be the best if you just book the room for the days that you are planning to stay at the room during lunch
2/15/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Because our storage room is also in paviljoen
2/15/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Storage room
2/15/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wait is embedded systems with those boards
2/15/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Where we keep the processor and parts
2/15/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Yupp
2/15/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oooh
2/15/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That explains
2/15/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yes we were there on time
2/15/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: But still
2/15/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I thinks is a bug in canvas, it might not work perfectly with the other systems
2/15/17, 18:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ∂P / ∂W (first is on top) means a derivative with respect to which one again?
2/15/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: W
2/15/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: think of dy/dx
2/15/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: that's also with respect to x
2/15/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Indeed
2/15/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: it generally means, make a derivative of the top one, with respect to the bottom one
2/15/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so if I have W²*P³, then ∂P/∂W = 2P³*W, right??
2/15/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: https://gyazo.com/a2a49f08a8c859d4bb634e379e74601b   isn't the answer to this just 2?
2/15/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: or do I need to apply that ony polynomial rule here
2/15/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: just try and find out
2/15/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for derivative of devision
2/15/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: oh, do I have as many tries as I want?
2/15/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 2 is not the answer
2/15/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Yeah its the same as calculus
2/15/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I see
2/15/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: are we allowed to use a calculator in the modelling midterm?
2/15/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: There is no math in the midterm
2/15/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: oh, well that's fine too :P
2/15/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: then the point of the weekly's is quite odd if you ask me
2/15/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There a midterm for modelling?!
2/15/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: ffs
2/15/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It will be in final exam
2/15/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: When?
2/15/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: March 8th
2/15/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: then let me rephrase my question: can we use a calculator in the modelling final exam?
2/15/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Do you only use natural numbers for calculating T(n)?
2/15/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: yes, n is always a natural number, c however can be anything above 0
2/15/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The final is 20 math questions and 20 modeling questions
2/15/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: is it true that for Data Structures Assignment 2 Question 4C, that you have to use case 3 and that the regularity condition does not hold? Or am i doing something wrong?
2/15/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: oh, wait
2/15/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: im retarded
2/15/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: <Media omitted>
2/15/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: This is how I did it
2/15/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Not sure if correct though
2/15/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: yeah, i figured it out. I made a mistake in copying the question -_-
2/15/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: FTFQ
2/15/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Read The Fucking Question
2/15/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That sucks
2/15/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: also, Read The Full Question
2/15/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i did, but copying is hard :S
2/15/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: "The question, the Whole question and Nothing but the question"
2/15/17, 20:03 - Bas Gieling: whoops
2/15/17, 20:03 - Bas Gieling: i called someone
2/15/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Shouldn't that 3 be a 4
2/15/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Yes it should
2/15/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Also I think a plugged in C instead of 1 in some parts
2/15/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
2/15/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lol
2/15/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is from the OER statistics
2/15/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: *rules
2/15/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>

2/15/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 🙊
2/15/17, 21:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Dont worry daan its just a resit ... nothing we havent done already 😂👌
2/15/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
2/15/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We're pros man
2/15/17, 21:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐔👌
2/16/17, 00:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well the final day for the LST grade deadline has just sprouted
2/16/17, 00:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm in a mood where I will do what I can to stick a grenade up their arse when they pass it by slacking
2/16/17, 01:52 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Uh Luttik is not in NL I thought
2/16/17, 01:52 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: That might have something to do with it
2/16/17, 07:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: He is on a sabbatical
2/16/17, 07:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sabbatical?
2/16/17, 07:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What is that
2/16/17, 07:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: http://bfy.tw/A7XD
2/16/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For how long?
2/16/17, 08:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I don't know, 2 months or something
2/16/17, 08:25 - Luke Houben: Don't the tutors grade the assignment then
2/16/17, 08:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But, the resit is just the normal Plebscience test
2/16/17, 08:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: For which Bloo is the responsible lecturer
2/16/17, 08:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah with only 40 students or so
2/16/17, 08:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: shouldn't physics be on oase yet/
2/16/17, 08:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, those will only be uploaded after the "inzage" I think
2/16/17, 08:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, LST didn't just have 40 students, it had resit students and from other programs as well
2/16/17, 08:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So it was more like 150
2/16/17, 08:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah so that should be easily manageable in 15 working days 😂
2/16/17, 08:30 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: They did 400+ people in 14 days after q1
2/16/17, 08:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering that's 21 days actually for dedicated people
2/16/17, 08:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah they just slack
2/16/17, 08:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Somehow magically all Programming, physics, calculus Q1 and Logic all take 3 weeks exactly
2/16/17, 08:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Dont worry daan its going to be today i think
2/16/17, 08:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: They are just postphoning the results
2/16/17, 08:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exactly
2/16/17, 08:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Lets just oray we took it
2/16/17, 08:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, please don't forget that the professors at this university are researchers first, teachers second
2/16/17, 08:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If only the bill would look like that
2/16/17, 08:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 2k tuition is really really really good for one of the best universities of europe for computer science
2/16/17, 08:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's not 2k
2/16/17, 08:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Government pays 8k
2/16/17, 08:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Internationals outside europe pay 10k here yearly
2/16/17, 08:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, 10k then
2/16/17, 08:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Still
2/16/17, 08:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Still ?
2/16/17, 08:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Rick please
2/16/17, 08:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I get better customer service at mc donalds
2/16/17, 08:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
2/16/17, 08:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's a nice statement
2/16/17, 08:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, you don't have to believe me, but the professors are doing what they can.
2/16/17, 08:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just like NS
2/16/17, 08:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sure they do ☺
2/16/17, 08:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How much do they pay for checking tests
2/16/17, 08:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I can check 150 tests in 1 week
2/16/17, 08:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Come one.. look at Kees's inconsistencybin lectures. It's like he didn't even try. He just explained some random methods each lecture
2/16/17, 08:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Some teachers kick ass but others are shit while they should be good as well
2/16/17, 08:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I have friends in breda in utrecht in groningen and rotterdam that have larger tests in terms of questions and their tests get checked in 5 days
2/16/17, 08:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maybe he's a pro researcher or something but don't let people teach who shouldn't
2/16/17, 08:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Anyway i just want to pass
2/16/17, 08:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Did everything
2/16/17, 08:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Except for induction part
2/16/17, 08:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But thats around 8ish
2/16/17, 08:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But then again its luttik
2/16/17, 08:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Soooo
2/16/17, 08:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Gods please let him be a merciful cunt
2/16/17, 08:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its luttik which means u probably failed
2/16/17, 08:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: jist like me
2/16/17, 08:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah
2/16/17, 08:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: You werent clear enough when you said that your name is max
2/16/17, 08:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because you didnt write down WHY you couldnt do induction
2/16/17, 08:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: In which language
2/16/17, 08:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Latin
2/16/17, 08:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hindu
2/16/17, 08:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you didnt specify WHY 3 is smaller than 5
2/16/17, 08:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How do we know you are max indeed
2/16/17, 08:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that's not clear enough
2/16/17, 08:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I call fraud on you mister you are not max
2/16/17, 08:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you need to say n is in natural numbers on the second line as well because we have a shortterm memory of 1 second
2/16/17, 08:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so once we start reading we forget what was on the first line
2/16/17, 08:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Kut the trash talk niggers
2/16/17, 08:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: kut

2/16/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Lets not talk about this in the spam chat
2/16/17, 08:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok 😐🗡
2/16/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: New kids is an old Brabantse TV series that made a few Movies as well
2/16/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: They talked plat brabants as a koekwous
2/16/17, 08:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: move to spam guys

2/16/17, 08:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: he actually did this on my and dimitars first attempt
2/16/17, 08:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Heh i forgot next time write on same line
2/16/17, 08:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes he did
2/16/17, 08:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And he said well that how you should do it 😸
2/16/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't think I did that every line. Just obviously when I declared the variable
2/16/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If I have a conversation with him should I say before every sentence "hi I'm Daan and...."
2/16/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: LOL
2/16/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: he didnt think it was clear enough when i declared n c N on the first line
2/16/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or just "hi I'm Daan" and start talking
2/16/17, 09:35 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: You can retry mathtest of moddeling right?
2/16/17, 09:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah
2/16/17, 09:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: it's like calculus online tests
2/16/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Ah not the whole test again just the question
2/16/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: https://gyazo.com/cc7d2c06841bc98ee6be1782357d6579
2/16/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: as you can see, it's using the same score system
2/16/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and if you make a mistake, you get less points
2/16/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but if you switch out from that question, and refresh it, you get a new attempt
2/16/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Great
2/16/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What did you get for physics man?
2/16/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 6.3 😏
2/16/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Wooh

2/16/17, 10:27 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: And an other tip for the math test dont use significant answers those are wrong

2/16/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: So what is the final grade again?
2/16/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: 2IT62?
2/16/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 61
2/16/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 38558225‬: Feelgoodman
2/16/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 34614111‬: final grade is 2IT60 i think
2/16/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Left is weeklies, middle is resit, right is final
2/16/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: I think
2/16/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, the final grade is obvious, but which of the two(2IT62 or 2IT61) is the grade for the resit?
2/16/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Middle is resit
2/16/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: 61
2/16/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ah okay
2/16/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: 2IT61

2/16/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Those are some nice grades you guys!
2/16/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Resit was much easier than the first one, but I'm not complaining
2/16/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, the first one was unhealthily hard
2/16/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i agree

2/16/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Think the helpdesk has more to offer than us
2/16/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: there is a helpdesk in paviljoen and one in mf, I'm not sure where the other ones are

2/16/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I couldn't make it to the exam for personal reasons (Told this to the study councelor) but now still have a No Show for 2IT60
2/16/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Do I still have my studypoints from the last exam (As I already passed the course)?
2/16/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Because it now says 2IT60 NV
2/16/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Why do you have a resit if you already passed it?
2/16/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: To get a higher grade
2/16/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Damn boi
2/16/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Email bloo about this or go to his office, highest grade counts so it shouldnt be a no show
2/16/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: On the bottom are still your 5 logic studypoints
2/16/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I saw yeah, so they still count?
2/16/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: It would be weird it won't but I'm not sure

2/16/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Correct, is second case of master theorem
2/16/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: YES it is
2/16/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but the question asks for upper and lower bounds
2/16/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I understand how to apply the master theorem
2/16/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but I didnt know if I had to use it here but thanks :)
2/16/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Upper and lower bounds meaning \Theta haha
2/16/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yeah okay I wasnt sure
2/16/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
2/16/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is a Greek letter
2/16/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It can be anything
2/16/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: a quick summary
2/16/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: of my high school greek classes
2/16/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
2/16/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: That's still there
2/16/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Then you're fine
2/16/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Good, thanks!
2/16/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I dont think you have to give a concrete answer for epsilon, just say there exist a number so it holds
2/16/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Finding that epsilon isn't that difficult
2/16/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: But how can I prove it exists
2/16/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: epsilon is at least higher than 1 here so it's definitely case 1
2/16/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I would have to write logn as a power of n
2/16/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Yeah but isnt question 4c impossible with master theorem because f (n) = n^2 log n
2/16/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: that doesn't matter thomas
2/16/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: you just have to know that n^2 log n grows faster than n^2
2/16/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: so you need a positive epsilon
2/16/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Okay thnx, now i know what i tried was too difficult😅
2/16/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: faster than n you mean right?
2/16/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: yes
2/16/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: n^2 is then faster than m
2/16/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: n
2/16/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Also grows faster then n^2 right?
2/16/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yeah but thats not the question haha
2/16/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: yes
2/16/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Just to be sure😂
2/16/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: but when you know it's faster than n^2 it's also faster than n
2/16/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: n²log n = Omega n² = Omega (n^(log4(4) + 1)
2/16/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: 👆
2/16/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: For data structures 4d
2/16/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Can you just say this?
2/16/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: <Media omitted>
2/16/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: If you want to do that, it'd be better to use induction
2/16/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Okay
2/16/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: and I think it's big o instead of theta or not?
2/16/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It's Theta, too
2/16/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: <Media omitted>
2/16/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: So theta I thought
2/16/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yup
2/16/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: can you pls explain what you're doing here I have no idea 😅
2/16/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: It says everything equal or less than 2 is constant so T(2) is c
2/16/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: then T(n)=T(n-1) + n^2
2/16/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: so T(3
2/16/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: T(3) = T(2) + 2^2 = c + 2^2
2/16/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: 3^2* two times
2/16/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: and T(4) = T(3) + 4^2 = c + 3^2 + 4^2
2/16/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: and so on
2/16/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh okay thanks
2/16/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: so T👎 = c + 3^2 + 4^2 + ... + n^2
2/16/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: get it?
2/16/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: oh lol

2/16/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah I get it now thanks haha
2/16/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: *
2/16/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: is it correct that there is no video lecture 2.4 for modelling?
2/16/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: because lecture 8 is for 2.3
2/16/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and lecture 9 is for 2.5
2/16/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
2/16/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: if this is the case you can make an algorithm running in Theta(n) time i think
2/16/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: doesnt feel right
2/16/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: the 'sorted' confused me too
2/16/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I assumed that they meant that the indexes i are 'sorted' (which they always are since that's just an array)
2/16/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Does one have to solve 4d of the Data Structures assignment by guessing the form using a recursion tree and then applying induction to prove it?
2/16/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: but it's pretty vague
2/16/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: to get n log n as the runtime i guess you should then transfer the list to a heap or not?
2/16/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: yea use the heap stuff
2/16/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: yes @31620276432
2/16/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: How does the induction part look like though?
2/16/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: i cant solve so far it either 😅
2/16/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: i cant solve it so far either 😅**\
2/16/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They say justify, not proof
2/16/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: is it true not all chapters for modelling are handled in video lectures? Because I've found some video lectures jump from 2.6 to 2.8, and I don't want to miss out on any lectures if possible
2/16/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Well then you have to read the notes
2/16/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Good luck

2/16/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Okay, but then I am still interested in how this proof would go.
2/16/17, 18:46 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys
2/16/17, 18:46 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Can heap have 0 vertices
2/16/17, 18:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm
2/16/17, 18:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I don't think so
2/16/17, 18:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It then isn't a heap anymore I think
2/16/17, 18:54 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Are you sure about that? Isn't it just an empty heap?
2/16/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, if I have nothing I can call it whatever I want
2/16/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I mean, a heap with 0 vertices can also be called the empty set or something else
2/16/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But I am not 100% sure, since looking it up does not really have any results
2/16/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: guys, i cant figure out the base case(n =1) in question 5C, the log_2(log_2(1)) = -infinity right? Or am i doing something wrong?
2/16/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah same florian
2/16/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Just come to Jort and get drunk
2/16/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 👍🏻
2/16/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: later, bram is not here until 8 at least
2/16/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Bram is comming as well?
2/16/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Nicee
2/16/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: yeah, but is someone here smart enough to solve that problem im having?
2/16/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You can look at page 86 and 87 of the book there is an example there that looks almost identical
2/16/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Oh damn nice
2/16/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Turtle god
2/16/17, 19:29 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: you sure its on page 86 and 87? Theyre talking about vertices at my page 86-87
2/16/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: What edition @31650858649
2/16/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I have 3
2/16/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: 3th
2/16/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Florian probably thought you were talking about the log becoming -infinity, while you are talking about the empty heap
2/16/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: yeah. im talking about the -infinity ^^
2/16/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i think thats the problem :P
2/16/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Physics is now also on oase btw

2/17/17, 14:59 - ‪+40 720 172 618‬: For data structures: when doing the master theorem case 3 and we're checking the regularity condition, do we have to come up only with a c or should we also give a value for n?
2/17/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: both c and n
2/17/17, 15:01 - ‪+40 720 172 618‬: Thanks 😊

2/17/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Or look at practice exercises
2/17/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: It's basically the same as dy/dx
2/17/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: @359886392842 trying to outsource his homework 😂
2/17/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Go to the practice exercises, fill in nothing, click on submit, click on solution
2/17/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And then you have an explanation
2/17/17, 19:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanks guys :|
2/17/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Well dimitar its really for the best to take a look yourself, as this is supposed to be the easy/basic question
2/17/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And the ones following are a lot harder

2/17/17, 19:39 - Casper Smits: can anyone help me or give some tips on how to solve exercise 5.b and c of Data Structures?
2/17/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Is that with the subtraction?
2/17/17, 19:53 - Casper Smits: 5b is with the subtraction yes
2/17/17, 19:53 - Casper Smits: I solved if differently though, but I am not sure if I am correct
2/17/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Have you read 3.4 or 4.3 from the book?
2/17/17, 19:53 - Casper Smits: yes I did
2/17/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: How did you solve it?
2/17/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: For question 7 of the assignment, are we allowed to use MaxHeapify(A), without describing the internal workings of MaxHeapify?
2/17/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: in the writing of our own algorithm
2/17/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: The book describes it so I guess you don't have to re-describe
2/17/17, 23:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Guys it's Friday nite

2/17/17, 23:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but first work hard
2/18/17, 00:10 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: they also "just use it" in the slides. so I assume we can do that as well
2/18/17, 00:13 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: If we didn't my assignment would be 5 km long, proof by contradiction: we can just use it

2/18/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Ceiling and floor can be dropped in the Master theorem.

2/18/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: because k+1 = a+b
2/18/17, 11:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Its a mistake
2/18/17, 11:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: it shoud be K+2 = a + b + 2
2/18/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you sure?
2/18/17, 11:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well k + 1   -  1 = a + b
2/18/17, 11:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: so k = a + b
2/18/17, 11:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: thus k + 2 = a + b + 2
2/18/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: because it makes more sense to me if you have k+1 = a+b as a is all the nodes in the left tree, and b all the ones in the right and then have the +1 for the root
2/18/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Makes sense ^
2/18/17, 11:54 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well, how can a + b be equal to k + 1?
2/18/17, 11:54 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Its said that a and b are subtrees
2/18/17, 11:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: so those subtrees in total give you k
2/18/17, 11:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: + root
2/18/17, 11:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: = k + 1
2/18/17, 11:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: so a + b + 1 = k + 1
2/18/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: ok, fine. you stick with that
2/18/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: i think Andrei is right on second thought 
Because the last line does not make sense ; if k+2=a+b+1 how can we conclude that (k+2)/2 is the same as (a+b+2)/2
2/18/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Or perhaps it was a typo and  they put +2 instead +1 in the last line 😅
2/18/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 46247309‬: A tree with k+1 nodes is split into a tree with (a) nodes, a tree with (b) nodes, and a root with 1 node.
So you find k+1 = a+b+1 or k+2 = a+b+2
2/18/17, 12:18 - Bart van Dooren: For 4d we say that we guess that the solution is as O(n^3)

2/18/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I get the whole proof but idk how this means it has been proved
2/18/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: We only concluded a+b=k+1 edges
2/18/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Would anyone help plz?
2/18/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I don't see how the proof is even correct. They started with a tree with k+1 edges, so they should end up with it having k edges
2/18/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Not k+1
2/18/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It should say a+b = k
2/18/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Because of this
2/18/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ahhh yes 👌

2/18/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: okay
2/18/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is t enough to use the master theorem for exercise 4 DS assignemnt 3 when possible?
2/18/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And just give the required information for each case
2/18/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yes
2/18/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Alright thanks
2/18/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: For exercise 4 you have to make the bounds as tight as possible, which is specifically stated, does that mean that for 4d you have to prove that Theta(n^3) holds? Or do you guys think it is enough to prove O(n^3)?
2/18/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You need to prove asymptotic bounds
2/18/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So \Theta
2/18/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: BigO and Omega also give asymptotic bounds right? The difference is if they gave an upper, a lower or a tight bound and now I write that down, I figure it makes sense to prove \Theta
2/18/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If you prove both BigO and Omega, you can prove Theta
2/18/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And I think Theta is a nicer notation

2/18/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: 9/11
2/18/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: passed 9/11 tests though
2/18/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and besides, we're storing simple questions and answers, not nuclear launch codes (yet)
2/18/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Well, you never know about that with this university
2/18/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: It would be more of a problem if we had a nuclear reactor like delft
2/18/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: We have jan.friso
2/18/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Just as dangerous
2/18/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: "Local man destroys multiple students grades"
2/18/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: TU/e has a nuclear reactor! It's called ATHENA(which is incidentally also a sorority of GEWIS), but it isn't in use anymore
2/18/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: http://www.tuencyclopedie.nl/index.php?title=Kernreactor_Athene
2/18/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Quick question
2/18/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: it is doable
2/18/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It has the form aT(n/b) + f👎
2/18/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: f( n)
2/18/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: a=4, b=4, f( n) = n^2log(n)
2/18/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm, but so far I've compared my log_b (a)  with the exponent of the f👎
2/18/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How would I compare it with n^2 logn
2/18/17, 17:59 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: but then this fails
2/18/17, 17:59 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 17:59 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: im stuck at this too
2/18/17, 17:59 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: there is no c less than 1
2/18/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: there is
2/18/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i had 1/4
2/18/17, 18:01 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4+*+n%5E2*Log%5B2,n%2F4%5D+%3C+0.25*n%5E2*Log%5B2,n%5D
2/18/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I used 1/2 and it worked as well
2/18/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i picked (n/4)^2
2/18/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: it says f(n/b)
2/18/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: so every n in n2 log n should become n/b
2/18/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: you didnt change the n^2
2/18/17, 18:14 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: OOHHH
2/18/17, 18:14 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: thanks
2/18/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Does anyone understand those base cases
2/18/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Like how many do you have to provide
2/18/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: For example for 5c of ds what would be the base cases
2/18/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It depends on how far you have to go back
2/18/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: When it for example is f👎 = xf(n-1) + yf(n-2) you need two, because to prove n=3, you need to be sure that n=1 and n=2 hold
2/18/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: For this one would only T(1) as base case be enough
2/18/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yep
2/18/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: because T(2),  T(3) and T(4) recurse on T(1)
2/18/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: ah okay
2/18/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And C
2/18/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: What would be your base case here?
2/18/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Over here you need n=2, because n=1 gives a math error
2/18/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ah okay that seems logical
2/18/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: there is still one thing I don't quite understand
2/18/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: gotchu bro
2/18/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: In 5B my boundary for the constant in it's base case T(1) is that c has to be larger then 2 right?
2/18/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And in my inductive step I just have that it can be any c>0
2/18/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Does that mean I made a mistake or do I just have to take the boundaries of the base case into account?
2/18/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: *the boundaries of the base case
2/18/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm, I dont really know what you mean
2/18/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I found in my base cases that it holds for c>2
2/18/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: but in my inductive step I just have that it holds for any c
2/18/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: does that mean it still has to be>2
2/18/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: or is it weird what I did?
2/18/17, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, it then has to be >2
2/18/17, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But I'd like to call in the help of @31643222030 to check if im correct
2/18/17, 18:47 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: okay haha
2/18/17, 18:47 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But thanks for checking!
2/18/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Am currently eating snert but will check after
2/18/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: snert is some good shit 👌🏻
2/18/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Snertjong
2/18/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: After a day of hout kloven nothing beats some snert
2/18/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Looks good to me @31620156447
2/18/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: ah okay ty!
2/18/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But still i find the base case in 5c a bit weird
2/18/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: because for T(1) and T(2) you'll get math errors
2/18/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: because if I understand well one should provide the base cases T(3) - T(9) for this one
2/18/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I mean T(3) untill T(8)
2/18/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Is there a technique for finding the necessary base cases?
2/18/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Just take the lowest one that is possible
2/18/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: When it for example is f👎 = xf(n-1) + yf(n-2) you need two, because to prove n=3, you need to be sure that n=1 and n=2 hold
2/18/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And this as well
2/18/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If you take base cases  T(2) and T(3), it is enough because T(4) and higher depend on T(2) and higher.
2/18/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: When for example doing the example with coins, you need to get as many base cases as the lowest coin
2/18/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But T(2) can't be a base case I think
2/18/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: because that means 0 =< c*log(log(2))
2/18/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: 0=< c*log(1)
2/18/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 0 ≤ 0 so, no problem
2/18/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: 0=<c*0
2/18/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: oh yeah
2/18/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: haha
2/18/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: then it makes sense
2/18/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: ty!
2/18/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The =< is really a bitch
2/18/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I fell for that one sometimes as well
2/18/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: wait a minute
2/18/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: you'll end up 2 =< c*0
2/18/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: if i'm not wrong
2/18/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: so you'll still get stuck on T(2)
2/18/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: @31610720282
2/18/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Why Word? Are you Satan himself?
2/18/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yeah but it's about if the T(2) case = O(nlog(log(n))
2/18/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: lel
2/18/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: but you can type equations really fast in word
2/18/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Then T(2) is still defined equal to 0
2/18/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: you can use the latex commands in the equation editor
2/18/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: But then its still unreadable :X
2/18/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Oh yeah sorry get it now
2/18/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: @31621963083 that's what you meant to ofc
2/18/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: thanks guys!
2/18/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I know this particular question has been discussed over and over by now haha, but I feel like 4d doesnt have to be proved...
2/18/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: If I look at the recursion module on Canvas, there is a similar example where they don't use induction to prove it. Next to that, they ask for tight bounds, but proving it with Theta instead of BigO is very difficult right? And finally, in exerciseb5 they specifically ask you to prove it, which they do not in 4...
2/18/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Did all of you actually prove it??
2/18/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Draw the recursion tree, sum it up, there's your theta
2/18/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I didn't prove it for 4d
2/18/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Recursion tree isn't a real proof though, right?
2/18/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It's only to help you with the substitution
2/18/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Afaik
2/18/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: They used in their practice exercises
2/18/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Guess it'll be OK today
2/18/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: then *
2/18/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It says justify your answer, not prove...
2/18/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Yeah exactly! Okay, thanks!
2/18/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Doew anyone know how to add these 2 ceilings?
2/18/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i just added them
2/18/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: idk if thats allowed
2/18/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: No i dont think this is how it works i tried it with a calculator 😅
2/18/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: And wiki does not agree as well
2/18/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: oh lol
2/18/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: For example the ceiling of 1/3 + ceiling of 1/2 is equal to 2
2/18/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Which is not the same as ceil(1/3 +1/2)
2/18/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: yeah that was the only thing i was struggling about
2/18/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: but then i said fuck it
2/18/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I didnt find anything to help me calculate this one sadly 😕
2/18/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You should consider different cases, where a is odd and b is either even or odd (you can't have that a and b are both even if they are subheaps).
2/18/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I'll try that thx
2/19/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: what is the approach to answer a question about substitution? is there some specific steps you need to write down for that? (in 5 for A2 that is)
2/19/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: because I don't really understand what they are even asking for me to do in 5a
2/19/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: In the lecture slides of last monday is an example
2/19/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: the one titled chapter 6?
2/19/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: nvm, I got the right slides
2/19/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but I don't really understand how you make a 'right guess'
2/19/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: <Media omitted>
2/19/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
2/19/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Thanks Anne! :)
2/19/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Guess for what?
2/19/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: well, for 5a, you get the formula 16T(n/4) + n²
2/19/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: how can I make a reasonable guess for that
2/19/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They've already given what bounds you have to prove
2/19/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
2/19/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: oh
2/19/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so the right part is what they give you as guess, and you have to prove that?
2/19/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The T(n) = \Omega(...) part is what you have to prove
2/19/17, 13:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Uuuh can i ask about this ?
2/19/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and the T(1) = 1 is basically the n_0 = 1 part
2/19/17, 13:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
2/19/17, 13:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Do i choose array of 10 or the one that says maybe
2/19/17, 13:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Just double checking
2/19/17, 13:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🙏🏿👴🏿
2/19/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Neither
2/19/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: b
2/19/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Lol Good luck to the guys starting with A2 just now
2/19/17, 13:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hah why ?
2/19/17, 13:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Edgy ?
2/19/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's A LOT
2/19/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You are the reason half of the people dont make it to the exam I guess😂
2/19/17, 13:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Me ?
2/19/17, 13:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How about you kill youself edgelord
2/19/17, 13:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Nobody asked for your opinion on me
2/19/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Indeed, you show, as a base case, that T(1) ≥ c*1²*log(1)
2/19/17, 13:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Quite cocky you are
2/19/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Never mentioned your name dimi
2/19/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thanks Anne!
2/19/17, 13:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sure
2/19/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so does that also mean that f( n ) = T👎
2/19/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and not 16T(n/4) + n²
2/19/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Which of this two cases apply
2/19/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: <Media omitted>
2/19/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I've seen that some people proved that 4c meets the regularity condition by with case 2
2/19/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You must show that T(n) ≥ c * n² log n for some c and all n≥ n0, by induction
2/19/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I kinda get stuck with the base case here
2/19/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I end up with 16T(1/4) + 1² >= c1*0
2/19/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: what do I do next?
2/19/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Note that it is actually 16T(ceil(1/4)) + 1^2, thus you get T(1), which is defined to be 1
2/19/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: oh damn, I didn't see the ceil part
2/19/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thanks
2/19/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I only need 1 base case here right? or do I need 2?
2/19/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: <Media omitted>
2/19/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: why is this the case?
2/19/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: you split k+1 up into a and b without dividing the root? So I would say it's k+1 = a+b+1?
2/19/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Should've been k+2=a+b+2 i think
2/19/17, 13:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys on 4 a) do we just use master theorem and give theta exact bound
2/19/17, 13:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ?
2/19/17, 13:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: They ask for upper and lower but on a) we can give exact right ?
2/19/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: T(1) = 1 by definition, so you don't have to compute T(1) with the recursive definition
2/19/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Theta is upper and lower bound
2/19/17, 13:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
2/19/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You only need 1 base case, because higher cases all depend on base case n = 1 or higher cases.
2/19/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so does that mean I get c1*0 <= 1?
2/19/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I'm kinda confused as to how to write down the base case now
2/19/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
2/19/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: that's it?
2/19/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: okay, then I think I know how to do the rest of it
2/19/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thanks again
2/19/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 54973499‬: At data-structures 7a, do you only have to care about the runtime of extract-max?
2/19/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Guys, at data-structures 5a/b/c, can you pick c = 0?
2/19/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can someone explain why 5b needs to be different from 5a? it seems like they are both the same kind of proof, only using a different definition(because they ask for O and not omega)
2/19/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Why are we asking questions in this group?
2/19/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Not only do we have a great website for these questions, if it's really urgent we even have a seperate groupchat for these question
2/19/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: s
2/19/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: why not
2/19/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: because people have personal preference. and the site is good, but not everyone is on the site 24/7 to respond, and if you want a quick answer why not ask it here. its what the group is for
2/19/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I am
2/19/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: See the second part of my argument
2/19/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we have a groupchat specifically for ds questions
2/19/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: use it
2/19/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Yeah, everyone folling WbS / SfS has data structures
2/19/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So this is fine.
2/19/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: following*
2/19/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: You can ask a questions on the site and then post them here to get attention
2/19/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I lose overzicht really fucking quickly if all questions are asked here
2/19/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: yeah but this is faster to ask/get answer
2/19/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: If you're not asking questions in the seperate groupchats because you think it's useless, please think about your fellow students
2/19/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: https://chat.whatsapp.com/6Qehj56nyjd7UOIrDMF5jT
2/19/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I have had many instances where a questions on the site got answered more quickly than on this group
2/19/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: guys, i know you worked hard on the site and a lot of people are using it, but some people have personal preferences for this group, let them use it
2/19/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: there is not reason not to use the groupchat specifically for cs though
2/19/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ds*
2/19/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'm not advertising the site because I have worked hard on it, but because I am trying to convince people to get out of there own narcissistic comfort zone to benefit the group as a whole.
2/19/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ^^
2/19/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Just as a quick advise, a lot of the questions asked here have already been answered. Before you ask a question, please check cs-students.nl to check if the question hasn't already been answered
2/19/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If you try 5b the normal way, it won't work out
2/19/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, I figured
2/19/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: that's where I'm stuck now
2/19/17, 14:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
2/19/17, 14:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Anyone ?
2/19/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: We assume that for all k with 1 ≤ k < n
	T(k) ≤ c1 * k²
	To prove: T👎 ≤ c1 * n²
T👎 = 4T(└n/2┘) + n

By IH: 4T(└n/2┘) + n 
≤ c1 * 4 * (n/2)² + n
= c1 * 4 * (n²/4) + n
= c1 * n² + n

I know I need to do something with another constant(according to page 85/86 from the book) but I don't understand how or where to put it
2/19/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can someone help me there?
2/19/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: It does, case 3
2/19/17, 14:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What is e ?
2/19/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Joost, put it on cs-students
2/19/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Because latex
2/19/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: maybe replace the 👎 by text
2/19/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: the question is already there, with an answer, but I don't understand it
2/19/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 👎 = ( n )
2/19/17, 14:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31647311973  if its case 3 what is e  ? We get n^(1+e ?
2/19/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Well, as it is n^2 log(n), e >1, as log(n) can be described as a power of n (You just don't know which) and n^2 = n^1 + 1
2/19/17, 14:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so we are allowed to do that ?
2/19/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: the more we know
2/19/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Not sure if it is allowed
2/19/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: But I did it haha
2/19/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oh..
2/19/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :| papa bless lets hope they accept
2/19/17, 14:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but for case 3 we have  a requirement
2/19/17, 14:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
2/19/17, 14:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31647311973
2/19/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I'm not able to check how I described it today so I can't help you with that part Dimitrar, sorry :x
2/19/17, 14:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: its ok thanks
2/19/17, 14:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: lets hope its right
2/19/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for 5c, do you need 1 base case, which is n = 2, or do you need to write out more?
2/19/17, 14:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 4d still masters ?i think not ?
2/19/17, 14:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: This -1 bothers me
2/19/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/questions/8585228/assignment-2-question-4-d
2/19/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Base case n = 2 and n = 3
2/19/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: N=4 and up depend on n = 2 and up
2/19/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and 3*log(log(3)) is about 2 right?
2/19/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can you give me a tip as to how I should solve the step part of this problem?
2/19/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: For those using cs-students.nl : Please make sure you add the question you are asking in the title, that way people can see quickly whether they can help you or not. Thanks in advance 😊
2/19/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: omg sorry jort
2/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: no worries, just for next time ;)
2/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I added comments under the affected questions so the guilty people know who they are
2/19/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 46909413‬: 4d do you have to prove with induction?
2/19/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it's answered on cs-students
2/19/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: but you have to use this sth-tree (can't recall the specific name atm)
2/19/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: *you can use a recursion tree
2/19/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: There are multiple ways to solve most exercises, especially the structural induction one. So don't start sweating if you did it another way.
2/19/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Do we need to elaborate on every base case from exercise 5?
2/19/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I just wrote T(1)=1 (given) in each of them
2/19/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I think that's not even totally necessary
2/19/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Not sure tho but It can't hurt to mention
2/19/17, 21:45 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Allright
2/19/17, 21:45 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: All of them hold right?
2/19/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah that's what i have too at least
2/19/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Are we allowed to use += in an algorithm?
2/19/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Yeah

2/20/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So you gotta take calculus again next year?
2/20/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Calc

2/20/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: does anyone know what the modeling midterm test will be about?
2/20/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
2/20/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: do we have practise tests?
2/20/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Their syllabus or something like that
2/20/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
2/20/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: i just found it haha
2/20/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but nothing to practise
2/20/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: When is the intermediate test?
2/20/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 8th of march
2/20/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: evening
2/20/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Why in the evening..
2/20/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: dont know
2/20/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: So everyone can take it at the same time
2/20/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So like during the scheduled Modelling hours monday morning?
2/20/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Idunno but those are free for all
2/20/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But now we have 2 extra days
2/20/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Thursday afternoon is also the timeslot that modelling occupies
2/20/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 21844269‬: What room will mathematical proofs be in?
2/20/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 69
2/20/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Aud3
2/20/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: How was the grade for the lab sessions from cs calculated? (Week1-3+Week4+Week5-7)/3 right?
2/20/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Idk, I believe so
2/20/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Because if that's the case my lab session grade is wrong haha
2/20/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: It might be that week 4 counts twice
2/20/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And then /4
2/20/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Its 10%+10%+10% = 30%
2/20/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Fundamentals will not be uploaded before Wednesday
2/20/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Confirmed by Arthur
2/20/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh but that is understandable :)
2/20/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Deadline is not until Thursday
2/20/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Don't be ridiculous
2/20/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: They have to recheck every score so that'll take some time
2/20/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
2/20/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What edit did they make
2/20/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Recheck/validate
2/20/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Not sure if I used the correct English term
2/20/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah so they changed something in the grading?
2/20/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Nope
2/20/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is this recheck something they always do for every course then?
2/20/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Guess so
2/20/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah probably to make sure you dont get more points than you dravers
2/20/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Deserve**
2/20/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So nothing extraordinary is going on and it's just the same case as for every other course that waits for the deadline 😊
2/20/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm real happy there actually is a deadline though
2/20/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I can wait 3 weeks if I know it won't be longer
2/20/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Yeah I know, but this will expand the lifespan of some F5-keys
2/20/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pfew
2/20/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks for sharing!
2/20/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Forgot to think about that haha
2/20/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It doesn't help F5 keys if the lecturer sends an email some hours before grades are online though
2/20/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You people know about autorefresh right?
2/20/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: Nope im new to stalking

2/20/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: How the hell does this work
2/20/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Clearly the top equation is not 0 when x and y are 0
2/20/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For the top one you look at X if I recall correctly
2/20/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since it's the derivative with respect to X
2/20/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: so you get 0 * something + 4 * ..
2/20/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wait
2/20/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I now see why you ask this
2/20/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: RT

2/20/17, 22:51 - Luke Houben: cs-students  will be offline for hopefully the last time such that we can try and fix some errors that still exist inside the application
2/21/17, 09:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For those who didn't know already:
Datastructures deadlines for A3 and Q3 are extended one week because of carnival
2/21/17, 09:36 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: NICE
2/21/17, 09:36 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Thanks arthur
2/21/17, 09:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Shouldnt have known that

2/21/17, 09:45 - Julian Smits: What is partition?
2/21/17, 09:48 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I believe it will be covered in tomorrow's lecture, as part of WuickSort
2/21/17, 09:50 - Julian Smits: Okay thanks
2/21/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 30686090‬: If you type "partition quick sort" on YouTube, fist video explains it very well
2/21/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But there are loads of different partition algorithms, they might use a different one in the lecture than the one in the video
2/21/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: It's in the book
2/21/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Your mom is in the book, thats why its so fat
2/21/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ok, sorry mr turtle
2/21/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This is the last spam
2/21/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 30686090‬: I checked with the book also. He explains it in the same way as there. Quicksort: Partitioning an array
2/21/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Anyone know who to contact ?

2/21/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I think you should go to the helpdesk hakan
2/21/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: In mf
2/21/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Wait
2/21/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Apparently you cab try again in 15 mins
2/21/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: That's the error you get when you filled in the wrong password too many times apparently. What nol said; try again in 15 minutes
2/21/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do a clean Windows install to get rid of their shit
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Stef did it and sounded enthousiastic
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: DAAN IDIOT
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ITS WINDOWS FUCKING 7 AND ITS A DELL
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: THATS NOT A TUE LAPTOP
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wait
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah I did not open the picture
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lel
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but indeed
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But why the heck would it give this error then :p
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i can really recommend the clean install to everybody who owns a TUe laptop
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Disconnect internet
2/21/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: And login also works
2/21/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: bc he tried his password too many times probably
2/21/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Stef why the FUCK ARE YOU ALWAYS SO FUCKING AGGRESSIVE YOU FUCKING IDIOT, GO TAKE SOME FUCKING CLASSES TO COPE WITH YOUR CANCER AGGRESION PROBLEM JESUS CHRIST
2/21/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He is just misunderstood Max, that's how that works nowadays
2/21/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I HAVE THAT CLASS ITS CALLED LIFT UR FUCKING ASS OFF UNTIL UR TIRED AS FUCK AND THEN DO IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY BUT I HAVENT BEEN TO THE FUCKING GYM YESTERDAY SO IM FUCKING AGRESSIVE
2/21/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Society is hard on him

2/21/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and now i just found out that this is the spam is kick chat so i hope turtleman is not gonna kick me
2/21/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Why the spam?
2/21/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: sorry
2/21/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i missed the fact that this was the no spam chat
2/21/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: thought it was #Kutmus
2/21/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Does anyone know why this error is here?
2/21/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
2/21/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I've mentioned the string timer_interrupt correctly at every instance
2/21/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: your timer was interrupted
2/21/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Do you have the ":"?
2/21/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If I change the names of my timer_interrupt to something else it also gives that error
2/21/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep
2/21/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Did you install the interupt correctly?
2/21/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep
2/21/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
2/21/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: and TIMER_INTR_ADDR is 16
2/21/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: which is the ti adress
2/21/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Well the install looks okay so maybe its the interrupt part
2/21/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I do have a lot of comments etc above my @DATA segment
2/21/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But when removing those it still doesn't seem to work
2/21/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Did you RTE?
2/21/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes
2/21/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I don't understand why it doesn't give any line error
2/21/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: As if something is wrong with the string somehow
2/21/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Thats just that the compiler isnt made to show a good error
2/21/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I know but now I literally have no clue what could be wrong ;/
2/21/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Me neither im sorry
2/21/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Comments are allowed in the data segment right?
2/21/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Yes
2/21/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Try loading IOAREA to R4?
2/21/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: To keep your adress in R5
2/21/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You have to SETI in the interrupt routine as well
2/21/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I have SETI in the interrupt routine too
2/21/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I added a metric shitton of code today
2/21/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And before everything was working
2/21/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Hmm
2/21/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But I've changed nothing in the TI
2/21/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Probably forgot a : or RTS or RTE somewhere
2/21/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Had that error before when I forgot RTS
2/21/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ahh that might be it
2/21/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll check!
2/21/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Found it
2/21/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Accidentally placed a brs instead of RTS somewhere and a ; instead of an :
2/21/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But now it compiles again ;D
2/21/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Great!
2/21/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Nice
2/21/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: GUys
2/21/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Now we're trying to upload the program to the pp2
2/21/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And after SETI 8 the first command is to load something into R0
2/21/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: This straingt up crashes the program
2/21/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Any idea what that could be?
2/21/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Like the processor disconnects
2/21/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We're loading a word that's we're using as a boolean so it's value is just 0
2/21/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And we declared it with DW
2/21/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Those are my initials 🤔
2/21/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: How did you declare it?
2/21/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: we think we got it now
2/21/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: no we dont

2/22/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So we basically need to win to prove we don't suck again
2/22/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: how are we gonna do that
2/22/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: like how are we gonna get 20K+ extra ducks
2/22/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: on top of the ones we need in order to keep the gap the same size
2/22/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Second place gets premium too
2/22/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just 6 months instead of 1 year
2/22/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: First of Europe gets 6 months as well

2/22/17, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: €3,33 a month
2/22/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Is this advertising channel Now?
2/22/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nah, I just assumed most of the people studying computer science would be interested in something relevant for their field and especially their position in said field ☺
2/22/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Why would i want a VPN again?
2/22/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Anonymous everything
2/22/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Including most of all torrenting
2/22/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Get ur ass a dynamic IP and be really anonymous
2/22/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Make it change 100 times per second
2/22/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's a thing to consider when taking into account our neighbouring countries are giving massive fines to torrenters
2/22/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not quite sure how you'd like to achieve that. This IP chances every time you open it and it in no way linked to anything you own
2/22/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Grouped with hundreds in a bunch
2/22/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hmm cool

2/22/17, 23:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Without using a custom DNS using a VPN doesn't matter
2/22/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: PIA is from usa, and there NSA and other institutes can request all data from companies https://thatoneprivacysite.net/
2/22/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Set up your own hardware on a remote location and run openVPN if you want the be secure.
2/22/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: After comparing a load of VPN services including Torguard I've used with much pleasure I concluded this would be the easiest and cheapest solution for splendid security :)
2/22/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or just dont do too much illegal stuff and No one Will care?
2/22/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This would be safest but way more expensive
2/22/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Dude.. You never download anything?
2/22/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I said not too much
2/22/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You got AMC subscription, HBO, Netflix etcetera?
2/22/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: But not anynimous
2/22/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Its not like the dutch government gives a fuck If you download movies
2/22/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So Why bother with the vpn n stuff
2/22/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Depends on how you handle hardware
2/22/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: They dont even have the manpower to track ur ass down anyways
2/22/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yet*
2/22/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: BTW I really don't care whether NSA knows I download something after they do extensive research. Also PIA (if I'm correct) saves no data logs at all, that's what actually makes them member of the top list together with Torguard
2/22/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: If they start caring tomorrow they have all the evidence they need
2/22/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: How would you do it?
2/22/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not For a couple of torrented movies at least
2/22/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Officially they already have the law in place
2/22/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They cannot backwards fine you for something that was semi-legal when you did it :)
2/22/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Rent hardware with bitcoins
2/22/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yeah but it's illegal now
2/22/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Still nobody cares
2/22/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well Stef, Germany is giving fines that go up to thousands of euros already if I recall correctly. The way they do this is by systematically looking at the newest torrents of popular movies and series, so if you start doing it safe now the chances of getting caught for earlier offenses are really small.
2/22/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Because they dont nearly have enough Manpower to individually fine us For Some lame movies we downloaded illegally
2/22/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Those top lists are mostly paid ads

2/22/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Believe me, if the fuckers at these companies can get money
2/22/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: They will come and get it
2/22/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And btw i Didnt torrent crap in like a Yeah

2/22/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Using that one hosting company that is also used by TPB
2/22/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So idgaf anyways lol
2/22/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: No, there are many places where you can hire anonymously
2/22/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You also don't close the door when going to the toilet right? seeing as you have nothing to hide
2/22/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sometimes i dont 😏
2/22/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: All im saying is that as long as im not torrenting crap im also not gonna pay For vpn n stuff
2/22/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Thats like buying condoms while ur not getting laid anyways
2/22/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: hey
2/22/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: LOL
2/22/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Vpn is not only for hiding torrents, if you ever use an netwerk you dont fully trust (free WiFi) you should use an vpn to keep your connection from prying eyes
2/22/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You're right, I don't like only paying for VPN, so I use a remote system which can do VPN, torrenting etc
2/22/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
2/22/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah i know
2/22/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But Then ill just use TUe vpn lol
2/22/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Kek yeah the tue must be really keen on your privacy
2/22/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Not on jurisdiction, it's in a five eyes country
2/22/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Not like they track by member what they are doing
2/22/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It was about unsecured networks*
2/22/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not torrenting
2/22/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But do I care regarding Brein is in the Benelux :p
2/22/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: NSA may know what episode of walking dead I'm torrenting
2/22/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pretty sure they don't care about Brein
2/22/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I was kidding just as much
2/22/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Also isn't it so that they use the same kind of no-data-logging as Whatsapp and Telegram do?
2/22/17, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Has DNS leak prevention options
2/22/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Where did you find That whatsapp doesn't log data, afaik whatsapp is from Facebook and they love logging data
2/22/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: DNS leaks can be prevented, but if you don't manually set a DNS it will use the one from the ISP which makes the connection go: you(plain>encrytped)>isp(encrypted)>VPN(encrypted>plain)>DNS which is your ISP(plain)>internet(plain)
2/22/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Was all over the news a couple of months ago.
They said the same thing as Telegram advertised with
2/22/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That data is only visible on sender and receiver and no party inbetween can access the data
2/22/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pretty sure it
2/22/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it's a lie
2/22/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But for Dutch instances it is the truth
2/22/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They suck at everything important
2/22/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Whatsapp used an encryption protocol that is considered one of the best by experts (signal protocol) but other than that its closed source so we don't know what they do outside of it, since its Facebook we can safely assume they log lots of stuff about you, your contacts and all the other stuff they can get access to. They also combine this with Facebook data they know about you (linking via your phone number).
Telegram doesn't have encryption by default and if you activate it is an protocol that is not well tested and generally worse than the signal protocol. 

If you want an chat app that does have an no-log policy (other than that you have an account) I can recommend signal (https://signal.org/)
Or alternatively an self hosted chat which is harder to setup for the average user you might want to chat with

2/23/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys have you ever encountered the an error where brs jump to the wrong place?
2/23/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I've specified it to jump to a certain spot but for some reason it jumps to the rule above that pointer
2/23/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And thus my whole program fucks up hard
2/23/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Typical case of #pp2
2/23/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah but that typical case is fucking up everything so hard
2/23/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Does anyone know what they want you to write in the specification document?
2/23/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Jfg just fucking you over once more

2/23/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Dw it will al be fine
2/23/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well currently I just don't have a fucking clue of what my code is doing
2/23/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: It's assembly: your code doesn't know what your code is doing.
2/23/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Has anyone ever had the problem that most of your jumps, BRA, BEQ, BNE, BRS jump to line _n-1_ while they should've jumped to line _n_?
2/23/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm so lost right now
2/23/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I have no idea how to fix this
2/23/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: are you sure that your labels are correct
2/23/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 100%
2/23/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm currently testing a part of my code
2/23/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: In my main code there are no problems
2/23/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: btw, if you put it like this:
1. Label1:
2.     LOAD ...
2/23/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: it points to 1, not to 2
2/23/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: and that's correct and there is no error in this
2/23/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I've been doing that all along but my main code works fine
2/23/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Well, you could redownload the tools
2/23/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I've  been doing it like this:
2/23/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: if you're sure the mistake is not on your side
2/23/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: ^
2/23/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But my main code works fine
2/23/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So i'll retry with label1: load
2/23/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Luuk your fix didn't work
2/23/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Everything is like this now:
2/23/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: label1: load
2/23/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: instead of label1:
                     load
2/23/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Hmm send me your code. Won't steal anything ofcourse

2/23/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So it would be a correct maintenance step?
2/23/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: you need multiple maintenance steps, for every case you
2/23/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: 1*
2/23/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: And don't forget to explicitly state that the cases you mentioned cover all cases.
2/23/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm kinda left it the dark with the proving of RadixSort by induction
2/23/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should prove that if until a certain amount of digits they are sorted that it is also the case for n+1 digits?
2/23/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Office hour?
2/23/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nehh, got all week to figure it out
2/23/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No vacation plans for me
2/23/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Your induction hypothesis should be that all z-1 digits have been sorted and you're now going to sort the z th digit
2/23/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks, can work with this
2/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Quick question for people who chose Psychology and Technology interaction in Q4: is psychology from wbs Q1 required to take that course?
2/23/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you can check in the information on oase under the section "prerequisites"
2/23/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Somebody got an idea where to find a stapler in MF?
2/23/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: At print shop on floor 1
2/24/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Also most office workers have them in the top floors, most of 'em are really nice people if you ask nicely to borrow a marker or a stapler :)
2/24/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: also maybe printing room
2/24/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
2/24/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: we're in U31

2/24/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Maybe
2/24/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Which one do you want?
2/24/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: we want the same thing but transparant
2/24/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: too late now we already made the trade ^^
2/24/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Surprise, it was us

2/24/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: U5?
2/24/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: U5!
2/24/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Storage
2/24/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is that the same as U120?
2/24/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Wait
2/24/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Storm
2/24/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Were you the guy that came to all the rooms asking for it?
2/24/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: :^) it seems Joost now knows me(50% chance at least)
2/24/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Were you the guy that came into room 32 asking for the key, when your partner got it from another group, and you told us ot wasn't needed anymore?
2/24/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yes, my old and weathered headphones on my neck iirc
2/24/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Then I guess I know what you look like now
2/24/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Why'd you need the key though
2/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: To open the lock
2/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Duh
2/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ok i'll bite
2/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Why did you want open that room
2/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For what reason
2/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: To get to their sorting machine
2/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: DUH
2/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What where you looking for
2/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ohhh
2/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: To store the models and building machine
2/24/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Paviljoen groups use u5 for storage
2/24/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ah the paviljoen plebs
2/24/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Now I have a 1/2 chance of knowing how you look like
2/24/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: We were with 3 though
2/24/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 2 guys and a girl
2/24/17, 22:02 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: hmmm, yeah my sexist mind just assumed that you were a guy bcuz of whapp name
2/24/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Wait Storm you're a guy
2/24/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You always seemed so feminine
2/24/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and you came to this conclusion because girls can't have sexist minds?
2/24/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: My life is a lue
2/24/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Lie
2/24/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No I just jumped to the conclusion
2/24/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Oh yeah
2/24/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm trying out the DENK mindset tonight
2/24/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But I'm pretty male though
2/24/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: can confirm
2/24/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: a pretty male* ;)
2/24/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I can't
2/24/17, 22:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: LOL
2/24/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: do you remember someone ironically dabbing early in the morning before the first lecture starts?
2/24/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Or someone laughing obnoxiously hard?
2/24/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Cause that's me
2/24/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Lol
2/24/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I know a female and male storm now, so I understand ruben's confusion
2/24/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Nice I've only ever met 2 other male storms both below age 7
2/24/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Did you assume I was female too Joost?
2/24/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: No I didn't
2/24/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: But I actually assumed the other storm was male
2/24/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: But she wasn't
2/24/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Guys in modelling , does anyone know why do we check the maxima and minima when we have a restricted domain ? 
Why does it not suffice to take the maxima/minima when setting partial derivative to zero ?
2/24/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Because it might not be in the domain
2/24/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: And then you need to look at the edges of the domain
2/24/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
2/24/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: X=2.5 didnt work *

2/25/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Guys how do you interpret exercise 8 of data structures?
2/25/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You are given an unsorted array A containing n distinct integers and a natural
number k < n. You are interested in the largest k numbers in sorted order. However, because
n is really big compared to k you don't want to sort the complete array.
2/25/17, 15:28 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Do I need to give only the numbers that are the same as k and sort those or what am I suppose to do?
2/25/17, 16:29 - Bas Gieling: no, you have to give the k biggest numbers, so for example you sort the array so that its decreasing and then take the first k elements of that array
2/25/17, 16:30 - Bas Gieling: i think
2/25/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: But you may not sort  FYI

I may have made a getto  proof that works
2/25/17, 17:01 - Bas Gieling: o
2/28/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am not advising you to use it, but I found a thing: https://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/cmps101/Spring11/hw/hw3sol.pdf
2/28/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Are there answers available for the questions in the lectures notes pdf from oncoarse for modeling?
2/28/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh wait

2/28/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Let me re-ask that, are there answers available for the question in the lecture notes pdf from oncoarse for modeling for chapter 3 and beyond?

2/28/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Anything we need to do on oase with a deadline?
2/28/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If there are deadlines those should be moved to the new system tbh
2/28/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: True
2/28/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But thats Not the case

3/1/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Depends on your preference for American or UK English
3/1/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys for the question of quiz 3 this is correct right?
3/1/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
3/1/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Yup that's exactly how I did it
3/1/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Just not as neat
3/1/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: wat wil je zeggen martin?
3/1/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: ben op floes goeie tijden akkabouz
3/1/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Same answer
3/1/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nice
3/1/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: See @31631192870 and @31628151420
3/1/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Always trust me
3/1/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm right
3/1/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ok
3/1/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: kk
3/1/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: @31623837581 Not sure if you still needed help with question 8b from A3 of data structures, but I've added an answer anyway
3/1/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Hope it helps
3/1/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: looks useful, I hadn't yet solved it
3/1/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ooh at cs-students.nl ?

3/1/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: With that link I see it but when manually navigating the site it is not there
3/1/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Should be in the Questions section with tag 2il50
3/1/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ooh wait I'm so dumb
3/1/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I forgot to navigate with the tags until just now
3/1/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: klopt
3/1/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fuck you Nick
3/1/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: :p
3/1/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Notice how the ":p"  makes it seem nicer than it is
3/1/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because it is not
3/1/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: ❤
3/1/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah I know
3/1/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yeah you can curse someone to death and end with ":)" and no one can complain, it's a magical stok achter de deur techniek

3/1/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Still love the stonecoal English
3/3/17, 03:52 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: is 8b as easy as using selection k times?
3/3/17, 03:57 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: i'll answer myself: no
3/3/17, 08:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think not indeed :p
3/3/17, 08:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since I heard people say 8b sucks
3/3/17, 08:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😜
3/3/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: If your approach is right it can be very simple
3/3/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Anyone else who lost his partner in crime for data structures?
3/3/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: @31650858649
3/3/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: well, he s not technically lost... I just dont trust him anymore to do anything ^^
3/3/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Salty
3/3/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: The dead sea is the saltiest place in the world, Florian is a close second
3/3/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Damn
3/3/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: oh I thought summoners Rift was the saltiest place in the world?
3/3/17, 10:25 - Bas Gieling: i think you havent played for honor yet
3/3/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
3/3/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I dont think you can sign up for partners anymore right?
3/3/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: nope, and neither can you switch partners
3/3/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you're 'stuck' with him/her
3/3/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: whether anyone likes it or not ;)
3/3/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: So, when youre stuck with a partner that refuses to learn lateX, doesnt know how whatsapp messaging works(only voice messages) and starts working on his part of the assignment 2 hours before the deadline.... Well, then you declare them ex-communicado and do everything alone :)
3/3/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or you email Arthur/ms. Speckman
3/3/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They are really responsive and helpful
3/3/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: RIP Florian
3/3/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Speckmann can help
3/3/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: meh, i honestly do not mind that much. If i do everything on my own im probably more prepared for the final exam
3/3/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: So it doesnt bother me as much
3/3/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: True
3/3/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Yes but
3/3/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Let the weak suffer?
3/3/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But make sure the other person doesn't get a grade for your work
3/3/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So continue alone
3/3/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I really like the John Wick reference
3/3/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: ^^
3/3/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i will think about that
3/3/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I wouldn't mind doing it on my own either but someone freeloading is just bs
3/3/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exactly
3/3/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Florian fuck that guy just do it on your own
3/3/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Also guy if you're in this group and reading
3/3/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Fuck u
3/3/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: this
3/3/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Lmao
3/3/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Is the whole "consider two numbers" thing for RadixSort the only way to go or is it too obvious that it's copied?
3/3/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How do you mean too obvious that it's copied
3/3/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: RadixSort is something they gave you in the slides so you're allowed to use it
3/3/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: There was a link that showed how to do the induction proof, it used comparison between two numbers. Was wondering if it was the only way
3/3/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't think we should prove the RadixSort again though right?
3/3/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since they proved it in the slides
3/3/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And we can use those at will
3/3/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: We have to...
3/3/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh shit
3/3/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Goodbye 3 points for 6b
3/3/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is literally part of the assignment
3/3/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: God fucking damnit
3/3/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So where's that link you just talked about Thomas..
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No its not
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Its Proven in the lectures
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: "Use induction to prove that RadixSort works. Indicate where your proof needs the assumption that the intermediate sort is stable"
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So we can use it
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Thats exercise 4
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wait
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But not again for exercise 6b right? :p
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Oh that shit
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Nope Just refer to 4
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since for 6b I use radixsort again but they ask for a proof there as well
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: OOh great
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: At ex 4 you need to prove it, doens't mean that you can't use it for other exercises
3/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will do that Sander
3/3/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Idk what I did but I guess I didnt use radixsort🤔
3/3/17, 13:42 - Luke Houben: I've no idea wtf i should even be doing
3/3/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: what do you mean with "consider two number"
3/3/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: We have to proof it, it is exercise 4 of assignment 3
3/3/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Prove*
3/3/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: Btw, it is not actually proven in the slides, only shown how it works
3/3/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: what do you mean with "consider two numbers"?
3/3/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think I have a good approach for 6b for which I'll share my thoughts here so you can check it for me haha
3/3/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
3/3/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Specifically the lower part
3/3/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: The other one says consider a and b at digit d, then what happens if a>b, a<b, a=b
3/3/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: what are you refering to?
3/3/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: idk
3/3/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: idc
3/3/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Anyone who knows why I no longer have permission to open the powerpoints for data structures?
3/3/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Just switch browser
3/3/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: It's a canvas bug
3/3/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Or delete cache and cookies
3/3/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Thx
3/3/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Can someone give me a hint on the algorithm for A3 ex 6b
3/3/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I cant seem to do it in n time
3/3/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: sort first with an algorithm that sorts in n time
3/3/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: then compare every interval with the proper conditions
3/3/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Do you sort on a or b for every interval? Or the combination
3/3/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i sort based on b only
3/3/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: but idk if its the correct way to do it
3/3/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Combination
3/3/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sorry, this
3/3/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And then compare both
3/3/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: daan stop scaring me ok
3/3/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sorting only needs one
3/3/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 🙊
3/3/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I still feel like you are comparing every interval to values of every interval, which would take n^2
3/3/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
3/3/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I still have to check whether that part is indeed O(n) but I thought it was
3/3/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is
3/3/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Check what daan sent in DS
3/3/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is by proof of "Daan said so"
3/3/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Most accurate one
3/3/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: https://cs-students.nl/questions/11928025/a3-q5b-counterexample
Although I already received an answer, I'm still not completely sure about this one... Are there some kind people who would be willing to help me out? ^^
3/3/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/3/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That should be your answer
3/3/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Showing one that fits the needs but does not work out
3/3/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's all you need to do :)
3/3/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why make it hard
3/3/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's not worth that many points so shouldn't be too difficult
3/3/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Thanks Daan! Appreciated! :)
3/3/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Just showing that _one_ algorithm that sorts some inputs correctly with just 2n-2 comparisons does not work for some other inputs isn't enough. That way, you still leave options for another algorithm that may exist. It can't be too concrete, just like in the lecture slides.
3/3/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wait
3/3/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Now I get doubts
3/3/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No you should also include that it works for all others
3/3/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But that's not hard with induction or so
3/3/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Ahhh... So even if people could get up with a completely new kind of algoritme that doesnt need any comparisons, our proof should still work. Therefore this is too concrete?
3/3/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They're probably talking about comparing algorithms only, because if you want to merge array A and B you can always say take a new array C with C.length = A.length + B.length, put all elements of A and B in C and then use a non comparison based algorithm to sort everything, 0 comparisons needed.
3/3/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Ah oke. Well, I understand now! Thanks Anne.
3/4/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So I could not really follow this discussion xD. Is it enough to derive a contradiction from the assumption that there exists an algorithm that correctly merges two sorted arrays of n inputs in 2n-2 comparisons?
3/4/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is O (n+10) the same as O (n) ?
3/4/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yes
3/4/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: * An algorithm that *always* correctly merges
3/4/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Jep, got that, alright thanks :)
3/4/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: Why is this not the way to go?
3/4/17, 14:00 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Because its k*n
3/4/17, 14:00 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Its bigger than n+klogk
3/4/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: But k is way smaller than n, do wouldn't n*k  just be n?
3/4/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: so*
3/4/17, 14:01 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: They still take it into account in the exercise hence the klogk
3/4/17, 14:02 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: You can do it by selecting n-k th element and partitioning the array
3/4/17, 14:02 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Both can be done in n
3/4/17, 14:02 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Then sort the k last elements
3/4/17, 14:02 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: You get +klogk
3/4/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: ah yeah that makes sense
3/4/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
3/4/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So, if someone still hasn't got a overleaf account...
https://www.overleaf.com/signup?ref=ad0474f5bded
3/4/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Wait, doesn't that just give you the last k elements instead of the k largest elements?
3/4/17, 14:25 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: I forgot to add that the selected element should be used as pivot in partitioning
3/4/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Ah, like that.
3/4/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: In Q6B, can you just call RadixSort on A or should you specify something else to access the second number of each interval?
3/4/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: where can i find when and where the midterm of modelling is?
3/4/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I said mofoking radixsort
3/4/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Proof by "because Daan said so"
3/4/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This was discussed before Thomas, and I clearly said so then as well
3/4/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 🙊
3/4/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No I more or less hope it will be correct haha
3/4/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I have no idea how to make the proof of correctness though, I know I need to show the loop invarient, initialization, maintenance and termination steps, but I have trouble making the invariant
3/4/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can someone help me with that?
3/4/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh good point, still need to do that as well
3/4/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I just said lel we proved radixsort already
3/4/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I have not proved my complete algorithm :p
3/4/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since you compare them afterwards
3/4/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: To be honest I think the loop invairant is a bit vague as well, but you can pretty much come up with something that fits
3/4/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So what is in this case true in all three parts of the algorithm?
3/4/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm the vague thing of loop invariants for me is that I could say for example that it is in all three cases so that a and b are the endpoints of the intervals in the array
3/4/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But that has nothing to do with our algorithm :p
3/4/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, I find myself having trouble with the invarients too
3/4/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31624553225 , Since our proofs consist of two parts (the RadixSort part and the comparison part), I don't think our loop invariant needs to include the sorting
3/4/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since that has been proven already
3/4/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If we prove that the sorting part doesn't mess it up it should be safe
3/4/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since you can just assume the radixsort work since it has already been proven
3/4/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If you state that you use a proven algorithm you shouldn't have to prove it again afaik
3/4/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The comparison part*
3/4/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but we added a comparison thingy after the radixsort here Johan
3/4/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So we should prove that that does not mess it up
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: 6b you mean?
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: you can just use RadixSort immediately right? so you only have to prove your own algorithm part in which you compare the intervals to find on without overlap
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Do you first sort and after that is done compare
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes, this exactly
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Or did you add the comparing in the sorting algorithm?
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No I just sort using RadixSort
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And then compare to find the answer
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Then just state in your proof that RadixSort is an algorithm proven to be correct in the slides
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: And go on proving the new part
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: That should be correct I think
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Great, thanks :)
3/4/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, that is what I want to do
3/4/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Proving that the comparison works shouldn't be too hard haha
3/4/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but I have trouble making up a good invariant for my own part
3/4/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: (fyi, I'm bad at this)
3/4/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Formulating invariants is annoying
3/4/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think I may have a general idea Joost
3/4/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What if you say something like we always know for sure that the interval we last looked at is the highest one that still overlaps others
3/4/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because the first one you find that does not overlap is your return value
3/4/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maybe makes sense?
3/4/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: in the invariant you have to write down what holds in the loop right? then all that holds in the loop for me, is that the interval is at least empty
3/4/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait what
3/4/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which interval
3/4/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and the endpoints and starting points for the current value, and previous value and next value are known
3/4/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: oh sorry
3/4/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: that is what my variable is called
3/4/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which variable
3/4/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I just return a variable called interval, which saves the intervals that I have that don't overlap
3/4/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and at the start it is NULL(empty) as we can also have an array with only overlapping intervals
3/4/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You make it harder than it is :)
3/4/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You only need to return the first one you find
3/4/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since the others don't matter anymore then
3/4/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, I do that too
3/4/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys, do we have any midterms, and when do we have them?
3/4/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyone know?
3/4/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nvm
3/4/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We have modeling midterm
3/4/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Poof that's it
3/4/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: when?
3/4/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and at what time*
3/4/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: 8 March in the evening I thought
3/4/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 20 multi choice questions
3/4/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: about chapters 1-3
3/4/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: not about the mathematical tools
3/4/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Isn't it only like 10% or something
3/4/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yh
3/4/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So no worries
3/4/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Intermediate = 10%, online math tests = 10%, final exam = 40%, modelling assignment = 40%
3/4/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: There is an example exam on cs-students.nl
3/4/17, 20:33 - ‪+31 6 14336980‬: Why does the exam have to be on 420
3/4/17, 20:34 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: y not
3/4/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I guess it will help you pass
3/4/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 420 what
3/4/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: blaze it fgt
3/4/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: take a space cake before the exam starts, just to add some pressure of finishing it in time
3/4/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 14336980‬: Ahahha
3/4/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
3/4/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah I know it's 420 blaze it for those weirdos on the interwebs
3/4/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But what does it mean that the exam is on 420
3/4/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 20 april
3/4/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 14336980‬: Educate yourself a bit daan learn the language
3/4/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 20 april?
3/4/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is wednesday 20 april
3/4/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: final test friend
3/4/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ahh
3/4/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Danke schön
3/5/17, 07:48 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Guys 
In 6b if the interval is not found , do we explicitly return NULL or do we return 0 as an indication of NULL ?
3/5/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: RTFQ
3/5/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "we return NULL"
3/5/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I read the full question before asking on the question 😊
But anyhow I think it is Null
3/5/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yes thank u
3/5/17, 10:28 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: we used NOT-FOUND tho I guess NULL is also fine
3/5/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They litterally ask you to return NULL :p
3/5/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why change it
3/5/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: cause doing what they ask you to do is so 201
3/5/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
3/5/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I honestly thought that it stated NOT-FOUND there the first times I read it xD
3/5/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Hence, rtfq
3/5/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: read the full question
3/5/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it can save grades
3/5/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: read the fucking question
3/5/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: shh, there are children watching
3/5/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: In quicksort, is the pivot always the last element of the array?
3/5/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or, does it have to be?
3/5/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: No, it doesn't. You can pick any value as pivot
3/5/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, but the value has to be the last element, right?
3/5/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: No
3/5/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Rather, using a lineair time median finding algorithm to find a the median and use that as the pivot will decrease the running time
3/5/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: ^
3/5/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, I am explaining it wrong
3/5/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sec
3/5/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
3/5/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yes
3/5/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ah, I think so yeah
3/5/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay, thanks!
3/5/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Did you guys use use the loop invariant etc for 6b and 8b?
3/5/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Should work
3/5/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Do you stop your Algo as soon as you find a non overlapping interval or do you return all of them
3/5/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well we were but rn we're not even sure our algo is correct
3/5/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So we need to redo some stuff
3/5/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: First
3/5/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Check canvas, they posted a message about it
3/5/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
3/5/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Thanks
3/5/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Are you guys using radixsort btw because that's what what's giving us trouble atm, after radixsort finding the non overlapping algo seems overly complicated (the way we're doing it rn at least)
3/5/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Wouldn't sorting the array make having linear time harder?
3/5/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah
3/5/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But how else would you do it? Because otherwise you'd have to check vs every interval right?
3/5/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And that would make having linear time quite hard too
3/5/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Still figuring it out
3/5/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: <Media omitted>
3/5/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: This is what I have at the moment
3/5/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: But I'm not sure if it works and it doesn't look like linear time at all
3/5/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yeah but thats n^2
3/5/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: when you sort first, it has linear time
3/5/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: If I remove the first loop and sort the array first its still n2 no?
3/5/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: nope
3/5/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: When you first sort, then check, you can get O(n+n), which is linear
3/5/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: But radix takes n
3/5/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: And then the loop is another n
3/5/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yeah but a for loop in a for loop is a sum in a sum
3/5/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: which is n^2
3/5/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Aaa
3/5/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Now I get the n + n
3/5/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: but sorting then doing a for loop afterwards is just n+n
3/5/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I hope that clears it up
3/5/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Yes thanks man
3/5/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: The conditional statements look fine right?
3/5/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: idk by hard haah
3/5/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: haha*
3/5/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Np
3/5/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: One last thing
3/5/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I thought we had a lot more shit
3/5/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Can I address the intervals like that
3/5/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Because I tried doing it in Java and had to do classes and stuff
3/5/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: probably fine
3/5/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yeah but its pseudocode
3/5/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: so you can make it up how you want to
3/5/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Nice
3/5/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: BTW I think my if statements only work in a sorted array
3/5/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yeah but you are gonna sort it beforehand right
3/5/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: so should be fine
3/5/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Bigocheatsheet.com
3/5/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Very handy

3/5/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Anyone knows if there exist a list with all the electives for the last quarter?
3/5/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Alright, thanks!
3/5/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It was on oase...
3/5/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Maybe it is on canvas now?

3/5/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Thnx
3/5/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: For question 8a did you guys just used a linear search?
3/5/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: how can you get to n log (n/k) in question 7?
3/5/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: A clear explanation is on cs students
3/5/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: We did
3/5/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: What does uniform distribution mean in the quiz ?
3/5/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: can you say that O ((n/k)log (n/k)) =O(nlog (n/k))?
3/5/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: If k is an Integer I would guess so
3/5/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Since it is upper bound
3/5/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: I dont think so, if you neglect it at the first divide, you should also neglect it at the second
3/5/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Not really necessary.
3/5/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: It would rather be the other way around, because n/k has more impact than log(n/k)
3/5/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: But nlog(n/k) > (n/k) log(nk)
3/5/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: yes but n^2 is also more than (n/k)log(n/k) ?
3/5/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I think if you say it is upper bounded by n^2 would also be technically correct as long as the upper bound is bigger
3/5/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: It is just not a 'tight' bound
3/5/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I think
3/5/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: <Media omitted>
3/5/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: but how else could you describe nlog (n/k) of question 7
3/5/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: n log n - n log k
3/5/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: = n*(logn-logk)
3/5/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: = n*log(n/k)
3/5/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: How likely is having O(n2) when using a randomized pivot
3/5/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: In quicksort
3/5/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Not likely at all. There is not really a set probability for it, but it won't happen often. The average runtime is still O(n log n)

3/5/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: asking for a friend
3/5/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 1-3

3/5/17, 21:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Also added summary of chapters 1-3 seperately
3/5/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I will read this once 30 minutes before the test
3/5/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: because maybe then I can be bothered
3/5/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: best advice
3/5/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Thnks anyway
3/5/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Whoops :p
3/5/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Storm likes to live dangerously

3/5/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: he causes ns to change its dienstregeling
3/5/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I can do that too.

Once.
3/5/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but it sure will fuck up the dienstregeling
3/5/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Haha, like how you can jump out of a plane without a parachute but only once
3/5/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I you really wanted to fuck shit up do it on like utrecht station just before the train comes
3/5/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: 👌👌 also bomb vests
3/5/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: love them, its like fireworks, but it includes death
3/5/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Stations are to wide, wait for the tracks to converge to 2 or 4. Then try and be on most of them at once
3/5/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (guys, I love spam just as much as you, but that isn't what this chat is for)
3/5/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh wait didn't even notice

3/5/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Like, if someone does it in, let's say best just to pick a name out of the hat, then no trains can go to and from Eindhoven and limburg. Also the amount of trains not going to their further destinations...
3/5/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: oh shit you're right
3/5/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Guys
3/5/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: My advice doesn't conform to my results
3/5/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I only failed one course so far
3/5/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: At first I failed 2, but I went to check the corrections and got my grade changed
3/5/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: My advice did not take this into account
3/5/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: any advice on what to do?
3/5/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I sent an email to Bloo already
3/5/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Send an email, I did the same
3/5/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But Bloo and Yves are busy as hell, because of the OASE/OSIRIS/Canvas shit
3/5/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so... we wait?
3/5/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah
3/5/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alrighty then

by summary I mean list of equations you need to know
3/5/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: i thought we didnt have mathematical tools in the midterm
3/5/17, 23:24 - Luke Houben: Nope we don't
3/5/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: no, but you will at the end. 
There is also a summary on chap 1-3
3/6/17, 07:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nothing. This is a preliminary advice which holds no rights at all. It's just some formality :)
3/6/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the letter states it influences the final advice ??
3/6/17, 09:08 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: If you are in a gray area it might, if you had something happen during a semester
3/6/17, 09:08 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Like a family member that died
3/6/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nope
3/6/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If you have 15 studypoints now and manage to end with 45 ur fine
3/6/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But Indeed like Luuk said, it could if there is a certain reason For ur lack of study points
3/6/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: it influences it in the way that if you only have 15 you need to work harder :p
3/6/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Point taken 🔥
3/6/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: okay i see
3/6/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i have 25 credits though
3/6/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but alright
3/6/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Then ur safe
3/6/17, 09:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Bloo might come to haunt you at night though Max
3/6/17, 09:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Bloo doesn't look too tough luckily :p

3/6/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: wait why?
3/6/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: so people can't cheat and copy your implementation
3/6/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: as in, copy the exact placements and such
3/6/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: oh

3/6/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: nowhere, we asked our tutor
3/6/17, 20:28 - Luke Houben: It was like that previous years as well
3/6/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: Oh, well our tutor didnt tell us anything
3/6/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: So thanks for the tip
3/6/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: yay for helpful tutors
3/6/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Wtf

3/6/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: wut. they didnt say that anywhere
3/6/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Nope they are too unclear
3/6/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Welcome to the wonderful world of incapable teachers and tutors that have no idea what the fuck they're saying
3/6/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So fk it
3/6/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Just leave it
3/6/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: so what am i supposed to talk about for our future planning?
3/6/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I think depends on your future planning..
3/6/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: so they want to know my planning?
3/6/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: this is strange
3/6/17, 21:45 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: like, should i just say, first we do this then that?
3/6/17, 21:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guys, question about the different summaries on the website
3/6/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The complete summary of chapters 1-7 displays 6 pages for only chapter 1
3/6/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and the summary for chapters 1-3 is 7 pages in total
3/6/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How can that be
3/6/17, 21:47 - Luke Houben: Left out all the BS and only wrote down the things that matter
3/6/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For the 1-3 version?
3/6/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because then I'll study that :p
3/6/17, 21:48 - Luke Houben: Yea
3/6/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Great!
3/6/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks for the info
3/6/17, 21:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We don't really mention is that specific just what's up ahead and what we're expecting planning wise ;)
3/6/17, 21:51 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: ah, ok
3/7/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: are there also answers available to the 2016 interm for modeling/
3/7/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Data structures grades are online
3/7/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fucking hell
3/7/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31643470096 we got wrecked
3/7/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
3/7/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i saw it indeed
3/7/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lol
3/7/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its not on my grades tab yet tho
3/7/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well if it's the hardest one of the bunch we could say it's sufficient
3/7/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since this is almost 5.5 :p
3/7/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 11.5/20
3/7/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And with Q3 it's a sufficient grade
3/7/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Still 5.8
3/7/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah haha
3/7/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I'd say great job
3/7/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I dont believe 50% wont be able to do the exam this year
3/7/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Guys, please check your marking as we lost 2 points because the examiner didn't read the last page and though we didn't do the question
3/7/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
3/7/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: if there is a question like this
3/7/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then why the hell would you prove it for all n
3/7/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: if it states SOMETIMES
3/7/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: rt @31643470096
3/7/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and he subtracted all points for both a and b
3/7/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: @31643470096 https://cs-students.nl/download/attachments/3604518/%5B0leb0%5D%20Modeling%20Interim%20Exam%20March%202016%20Answers.pdf?api=v2
3/7/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so thats 4 points lost for misinterpreting 1 word?
3/7/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Thanks Nimo!
3/7/17, 18:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Kom dan gaan we samen klagen 😁
3/7/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Ik vind het goed
3/7/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: want eerlijk
3/7/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: de manier van de vraag impliceert gewoon dat dat niet bij elke n zo hoeft te zijn
3/7/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Nee idd
3/7/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: En als het bij eentje het geval is, dan is het bij "soms"
3/7/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Goed genederlandsdt
3/7/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: heb hetzelfde luuk / stef
3/7/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
3/7/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did he really subtract 4 points while we did the question correct?
3/7/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah
3/7/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can't seem to remember where I've seen it, as it's not in my notes, nor in the summary from cs-students
3/7/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: We have 0 points For 5
3/7/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay this goes beyond this little shaky fellow if he doesn' listen
3/7/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We're taking this to a higher level of authority else Stef
3/7/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No jokes
3/7/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is bullshit
3/7/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I will defend the few rights I have
3/7/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
3/7/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: We also had it correct the first time, but we changed it because that made more sense.
3/7/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: What do you get -2
3/7/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: rip
3/7/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We'll simply tell the mofo to read the fucking question
3/7/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sometimes clearly states once or more
3/7/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sometimes means not always the opposite
3/7/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Tbh a lot of the questions were kind of vague.
3/7/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Jeah But still
3/7/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This even was a clear one Nick 😂
3/7/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sometimes != For all n
3/7/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He just fucked up in RTFQ
3/7/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks for checking Stef, guy goes down
3/7/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Else Speckmann is gonna be unable to give lecture
3/7/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hahahaha
3/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I think that If we he doesnt Give in that Arthur would be our best guess
3/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 4 motherfucking points
3/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Since he is most symapthic
3/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or What that is in english
3/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Arthur is next, he answers quickly and is a cool guy
3/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Do you have real feedback or just which points you got ?
3/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sympathetic?
3/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Does anyone have all points for 5 and is willing to share it right now?
3/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well he said why he didn't give the points Tom haha
3/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: We have all points
3/7/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh
3/7/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: because id like to know what was supposed to be the correct answer
3/7/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: You want our file ?
3/7/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Comments as Well
3/7/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: i wont plagiarize lol
3/7/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: RT
3/7/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh where do you see the comments
3/7/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Click the assignment
3/7/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: "view feedback"
3/7/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But If you could send a screenshot of ur solution from 5 that would be great
3/7/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, if I do that
3/7/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: It just downloads the regular file
3/7/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So I guess he didn't add feedback to ours :/
3/7/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No you dont need to download it
3/7/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Go to grades
3/7/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And click assignment 3
3/7/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That should lead you to a "preview" of ur file
3/7/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: With comments
3/7/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I did that, no comments :/
3/7/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: It could just be that he didn't upload the comments yet
3/7/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I don't have them either
3/7/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Probably
3/7/17, 18:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, should we learn  Language of ACCEL and Units in ACCEL for midterm examination?
3/7/17, 18:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: (modeling)
3/7/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
3/7/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Don't think so
3/7/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Don't believe so
3/7/17, 18:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Jort
3/7/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Guys Q6 from DS with the overlapping, did they also say that when endpoint and Startpoint are equal they dont overlap is wrong?
3/7/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Seems like our teacher doesnt know what open brackets are
3/7/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Sander i think you can argue and get your points back on open interval if you really did it correctly
3/7/17, 19:06 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: o/
3/7/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: how about some of us start uploading (near) perfect Data Structures Assignments (or single questions from those) so we can look at all the possible correct solutions?
3/7/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: uploading to CSStudents that is
3/7/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It would also be very handy for the exams since 1 or 2 questions from those assignments will return
3/7/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We've got 1 and 2 near perfect
3/7/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 18 and 19 points
3/7/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yes smart idea
3/7/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Please do so
3/7/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We could even upload with tutors comments so that near perfect, becomes perfect
3/7/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: could one of the mods add another folder im the DS folder?
3/7/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Sure
3/7/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: and I cant seem to upload files. only view them
3/7/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you should have the right permissions
3/7/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's there
3/7/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: not in the main DS folder
3/7/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
3/7/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i have 14.5 points out of 16, why do you guys have out of 20 points lol?
3/7/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31643470096 , did our nazi say this is wrong as well?
3/7/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: for ours
3/7/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Including the test
3/7/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: @31650858649
3/7/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They do that to get +8 so it sounds better for the first :p
3/7/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And second some other pointsnumber
3/7/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: ohh
3/7/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: plus test i got 18.5 out of 20 then, got it
3/7/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: any interest in my solution then?
3/7/17, 19:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Think a lot of us will :)
3/7/17, 19:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It might be an idea for people who want to share their solutions to add some comments in their pdf where they miss some points, if they do
3/7/17, 19:25 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: http://www.slashdot.org/story/323341 in before spam, this might be of great interest of a lot of people here
3/7/17, 19:26 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you can download the direct files from canvas (with comments/annotations)
3/7/17, 19:26 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: So what hours of ds tomorrow will actually be lecture
3/7/17, 19:26 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: 3+4
3/7/17, 19:26 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: 1+2 is the tutor hour
3/7/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: but I recommend going there since they will discuss A3 there (and give hints/tips on A4)
3/7/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That's even better
3/7/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: <Media omitted>
3/7/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I did that, no feedback tho :/
3/7/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Then your tutor is lazy or you have perfect solutions
3/7/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Feedback is on the right of the file
3/7/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Depends on which PDF reader you use
3/7/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Well, more than one tutor looks to your pdf
3/7/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Guys is there only one modelling exam
3/7/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So it is pretty weird if there is no feedback at all
3/7/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Lol no
3/7/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: We did not have a 10
3/7/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ahhh it's on my phone
3/7/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: That will be it
3/7/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Depends on tutor group probably
3/7/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Past exam
3/7/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I'm in group 3
3/7/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Im group 11
3/7/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: assignment3 of me is on CSstudents
3/7/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Most groups are smaller, so one tutor is probably enough to check all the assignments
3/7/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You can also add comments to the preview of the file instead of the entire folder
3/7/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: oh
3/7/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: well, thats for next time XD

3/7/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Then you can add it to your file
3/7/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Prolly better for clarity
3/7/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: its fine, did it myself already thanks to all the peer pressure :D
3/7/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hahaha

3/7/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will we have a near-empty week before the upcoming exams again?
3/7/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For Physics purposes mainly :p
3/7/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Depends on the lecturerers
3/7/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Lectures are scheduled
3/7/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But if we're already finished then yes
3/7/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Otherwise no
3/7/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fuck :p
3/7/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Well you can plan ES yourself with your group
3/7/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: There are no 'real' modeling lectures
3/7/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: and there are no lectures for DS
3/7/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: <Media omitted>
3/7/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wait that's true :p
3/7/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks for being such a beacon in the darkness Nick
3/7/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: No worries haha
3/7/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Now go kill our tutor for the exercise 5 massacre
3/7/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You've won Dark Souls
3/7/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You can handle him
3/7/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Maybe haha
3/7/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: We'll try tomorrow

3/7/17, 20:17 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: <Media omitted>
3/7/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Another interim test
3/7/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ty darling
3/7/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: No sugarbum
3/7/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: thanks, added them to cs-students ;)
3/7/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Do I get cs-student points now
3/7/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: no
3/7/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: unfortunately I can't manually add them
3/7/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I would if I could ;)
3/7/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: <Media omitted>
3/7/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
3/7/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is it possible that you're watchting the files space?
3/7/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Is the answer 54?
3/7/17, 21:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Watching also sends emails about updates
3/7/17, 21:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You take everything and * it based on the condition
3/7/17, 21:12 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yes
3/7/17, 21:12 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: what do i take tho
3/7/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 3*3*2*1*3
3/7/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Well you just have to calculate the amount of options which involve needsCoffee so: 3*3*2*1(only the option yes for need coffee)*3=54
3/7/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ohh
3/7/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: okay
3/7/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i got it
3/7/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: thanks guys
3/7/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ^^
3/7/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The first "sub"model has size 3 the one after that as well, the one after has 2, the one after also has 2 but since you want coffee we omit 1 so it becomes 1 and the last one has 3
3/7/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Nice!:)
3/7/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: @31631192870 learn
3/7/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I knew that already
3/7/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Go to https://cs-students.nl/users/viewmyemailsettings.action, hit edit and deselect all email notifications
3/7/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Did this yesterday already, but I'm still recieving
3/7/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Have you checked yet if you're watching the file space?
3/7/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm guessing that's the problem ;)
3/7/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: ok, are there any channels you're watching in this page: https://cs-students.nl/users/viewnotifications.action ?
3/7/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: I unwatched ComputerScience
3/7/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Now everything should be alright then?
3/7/17, 21:24 - Luke Houben: Yess
3/7/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Okay
3/7/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Thanks!
3/7/17, 21:25 - Luke Houben: I see now all other pages are unwatched as well so there should be no more annoying mails anymore. If they keep continuing, please contact me or jort
3/7/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Okay, I will!
3/8/17, 08:04 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: If someone has done the DS quiz,  could you help me with this question please https://cs-students.nl/questions/11929293
3/8/17, 08:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: DS quiz?
3/8/17, 08:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There is no quiz this week right
3/8/17, 08:19 - Luke Houben: There is loo
3/8/17, 08:19 - Luke Houben: Lol
3/8/17, 08:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Only the assignment for 20 points I thought from now on
3/8/17, 08:23 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: No there's quiz for 5 points
3/8/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Assignment is 15 this week
3/8/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Really, damn
3/8/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: EZ 😋
3/8/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah hahah
3/8/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If I recall correctly Canvas stated last week that A4-6 were 20 points each
3/8/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Without quizzes
3/8/17, 08:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Gj daan
3/8/17, 08:25 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah when the assignment isn't available it doesn't show the quiz yet
3/8/17, 08:25 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Something like that
3/8/17, 08:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ooh
3/8/17, 08:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Derps
3/8/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: For DS, we need to get 50% of the points you can get, is that including or excluding quizzes?
3/8/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yup emailing arthur it is
3/8/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Tutor is not gonna bend
3/8/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Let's go to Arthur with an army of people who "misinterpreted" question 5 of the data structures
3/8/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what?
3/8/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes that can also work
3/8/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: His office
3/8/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what do you mean misinterpreted
3/8/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I completely missed this
3/8/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: What happened to q5?
3/8/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Sometimes implies that it's not always the case
3/8/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: By answering the question but giving the wrong one of the two correct answers, giving the question is ambiguous apparently
3/8/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: the question is not stated clearly
3/8/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ahh i see
3/8/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: true luuk
3/8/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: the thing is
3/8/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: any n
3/8/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: can mean two things in this case
3/8/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: and furthermore, the definition of "any" is "one or more"
3/8/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: if they had just said for all n
3/8/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or for every n
3/8/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then it would not have been a problem
3/8/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah exactly that
3/8/17, 09:08 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: and the "sometimes" also makes it more clear that proving for 1 n is enough
3/8/17, 09:08 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: I see how it can be interpreted in the way they do, but that doesn't mean that that is the only way that it could be interpreted
3/8/17, 09:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So they even gave us two words that have two correct meanings
3/8/17, 09:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sometimes being at least once
3/8/17, 09:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and any being "any any which is larger than 1"
3/8/17, 09:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: any n*
3/8/17, 09:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: which could be seen as some n
3/8/17, 09:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or every n
3/8/17, 09:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or one n
3/8/17, 09:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: :p
3/8/17, 09:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but in combination with sometimes it is more obvious that it would mean one n
3/8/17, 09:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jesus.. If they would have stated this clearly it wouldn't be such a problem, it doesn't increase the difficulty of the question
3/8/17, 09:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exactly
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: true
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Guys, you can try going to the professor/corrector yourself
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: We did
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We're at the tutor/corrector now
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But co@gewis.nl works better probably
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: He told me to go to arthur
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ah, okay
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So next step is Arthur
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wait
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Let Rick explain
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah ours told us that as well luuk
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How does that work Rick? And how is it better
3/8/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: First go to arthur, then mail
3/8/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: When are his office hours
3/8/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: there is an office hour on thursday
3/8/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Since if you send an email to co@gewis.nl, you it firstly gets officially registered, which isn't the case when you do it yourself
3/8/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: dunno what time
3/8/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay I think Rick's way sounds interesting
3/8/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And for example, if there are a lot of complaints about the subject, it gets officially registered
3/8/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: seems legit @31642623926
3/8/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If we all send the email to co@gewis.nl individually then they get a lot of complaints
3/8/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And I guess then they will need to take a serious look at it?
3/8/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: First go to arthur personally, we can explain it more proper in person, and he won't feel pressured
3/8/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: They get officially reprimanded, sorry
3/8/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: PRESSURE HIM LUUK
3/8/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: We can always mail afterwards
3/8/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: pressure is the only possible way
3/8/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We can always ask nicely after pointing a gun at his head
3/8/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: official pressure*
3/8/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: this always tends to get things done
3/8/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Secondly, GEWIS gets taken a lot more seriously by a lot of staff because it isn't a random kid complaining
3/8/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Yes but we can always mail gewis afterwards
3/8/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The only thing you have to take into account is that Patricia is going to look if your complaint is legit, and she can judge that it is not
3/8/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (Which she rarely does tho)
3/8/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well if she does we go ourselves anyway haha
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: So you really want to mail gewis first?....
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, I also had a complaint, and I thought I was right as well
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: if he has already decided that our argument is invalid then this wont work
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But we'll first go to Arthur because that is the ethical way in my opinion. Maybe Arthur would help us anyway and this would be a backstab
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: bc then hell just say
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31620321013  is right
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i already handled this
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hm
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: might be
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but if we go and he says no
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then were done
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah what would that give Rick?
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: bc then mailing gewis wont help anymore
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would Gewis still work after Arthur gives us a no?
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: bc he already decided on the matter then
3/8/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: that's not true
3/8/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: because if he says so, it doens't mean he's right
3/8/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: True
3/8/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You can always try of course
3/8/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no but it means that he has already looked in to it
3/8/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is literally the CO's job to solve stuff like this
3/8/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so hell just say to gewis that he has already taken care of it i guess
3/8/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: if gewis knows that our complaint is valid, i'm sure they will do something
3/8/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, if the CO judges your complaint is legit, and Arthur says it isn't, she will solve it for you
3/8/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well in that case I agree with @31620321013 . We go ourselves first and maybe it's an easy fix.

Given that the CO is exactly here to solve this I don't think that option gets less powerful. Given that we have a valid point of course
3/8/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/8/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Last thing Rick said
3/8/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: okay fair enough
3/8/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lets go to arthur first then
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😘
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But please keep in mind that your complaint might not be legit at all, and then even the best of CO's GEWIS ever had can't help you
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No no of course
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I'd like to try haha
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but i do think that it would help if we went with a few people from different groups with the same problem
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: I'm pretty sure that our complaint is legit tho
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not in a way of pressuring him
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Of course, just E-mail her
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes, we need a lot of people at Arthur's office
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: To make sure he notices it is an actual problem
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but just to show that there are more people with the same problem
3/8/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That won't work, just one or two persons explaining it calmly works better
3/8/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and then 1 or 2 people who talk with him
3/8/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/8/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: otherwhise it will be a kippenhok 2.0
3/8/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I'd also suggest e-mailing, because then you can order your thoughts better
3/8/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: two people talk and the rest is just to fill the room
3/8/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I also said that but Stef says no and now I'm scared
3/8/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Me, Stef, Daan, and this guy who I don't know his name of in my tutor group have the same complaint
3/8/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: So that's at least 4
3/8/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nick as well
3/8/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: heard @31631192870 say it as well
3/8/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: You can always email afterwards guys...
3/8/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i just said yes tbh
3/8/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Are there people who say NO DON'T MAIL ARTHUR?

Because else I would like to propose the following:

Let me create a nice and tidy email with all our points clearly explained, and add a list of all names of people we know had that problem to make it more valid.
3/8/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How is that?
3/8/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That
3/8/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For Arthur, not the CO
3/8/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And maybe CC/BCC co@gewis.nl
3/8/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's even better maybe
3/8/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: that could be an option
3/8/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: first mail arthur, afterwards mail the CO
3/8/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, you won't backstab him if he resolves it nicely, then he won't get reprimanded for it
3/8/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Right
3/8/17, 09:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Luuk, Rick could be right about CC/BCC the CO
3/8/17, 09:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since then it's a serious thingy without doubt
3/8/17, 09:22 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: yes that is an option
3/8/17, 09:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't want to backstab so this fixes that, but I know that this is a hard business world
3/8/17, 09:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So we should be hard as well
3/8/17, 09:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, you can always just drop by for advice, without making it an complaint
3/8/17, 09:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No Stef not in your way
3/8/17, 09:23 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Well, backstabbing is never the way
3/8/17, 09:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I like to complain :p
3/8/17, 09:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Just go to GEWIS, ask for Patricia and ask her for advice
3/8/17, 09:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Instructions unclear: asked for Patricia's price
3/8/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But as of now, shall I create a nice and clear email with all our names to send to Arthur and optionally to Patricia?
3/8/17, 09:30 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Yes that's a good idea
3/8/17, 09:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will do that after a bathroom break. Need to do peepee
3/8/17, 09:30 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Everyone who had the same complaint, i suggest to let Daan know
3/8/17, 09:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/8/17, 09:30 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: meee
3/8/17, 09:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Send @Me your name
3/8/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: @Me Maas van Apeldoorn
3/8/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: (nudes may be included, won't be exposed)
3/8/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kR8lHr5-79W_EOOWtYrquhRrB-0rko3PmLpZGpIotac/edit?usp=sharing
3/8/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is better
3/8/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Add your name to the dox
3/8/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: What are we putting names down for?
3/8/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Who got 0 points for exercise 5 in A3 of Datastructures because the question is very ambiguous
3/8/17, 09:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Ah, unfortunately I don't qualify 🙃
3/8/17, 09:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Are there any other people that got deducted points at exercise 5 of assignment 3 from Datastructures regarding the ambiguity in the question phrasing?
3/8/17, 09:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Please fill your name in here
3/8/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: daan this was ur worst idea ever
3/8/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No it isn't
3/8/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it worked
3/8/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
3/8/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
3/8/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Noticed the sometimes missing space in first part
3/8/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Arthur is dutch, yaknow?
3/8/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Whoops, forgot, but does it matter a lot?
3/8/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You guys can check my English and change it haha
3/8/17, 09:59 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: het is martin, niet martijn
3/8/17, 09:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lol

3/8/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Mooi mooi
3/8/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: En volgens mij hebben we ook niet echt een vraag, het zijn allemaal stellingen of ligt dat nou aan mij
3/8/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: we vragen niet echt of hij er opnieuw naar wilt kijken
3/8/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: This is important
3/8/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
3/8/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ik denk dat de vraag hem wel duidelijk is toch? Of zal ik dat nog even toevoegen
3/8/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ja ik zal het wel netjes vragen idd
3/8/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: moment
3/8/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>

3/8/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay I will send it right now then
3/8/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since laptop is screaming and dying from battery drainage
3/8/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should I include the CO from Gewis?
3/8/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or not
3/8/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think maybe not the first time. Looks a bit passive agressive
3/8/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: BCC?
3/8/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will do

3/8/17, 10:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Laptop went into hibernation mode until I plug it in
3/8/17, 10:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Progress is saved though
3/8/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 11191755‬: quite some times -> "several times" or "for quite some time"
3/8/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks!
3/8/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's gonna be send now

3/8/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Neem niet de eiersalade stokbrood
3/8/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ik maak het wel over
3/8/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Want
3/8/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: <Media omitted>
3/8/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: All those hearts are heartwarming on such a rainy day
3/8/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Did you guys get an email about the honors project ?
3/8/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No
3/8/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm not a nerd, I don't get good grades
3/8/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Yes 😆
3/8/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No I think they only give those to people with 8 average or so haha
3/8/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Well, it's not about grades, but about getting 30 ECTS
3/8/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Right ?
3/8/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh really
3/8/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah I thought so
3/8/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: It is yes
3/8/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hmmm I got 30 ECTS, don't have the email
3/8/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: It was sent by honorsacademy@tue.nl, you can try contacting them if you want
3/8/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Alright thanks
3/8/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's like inviting yourself to a party you're not invited to :p
3/8/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Well, but a party I should be invited to ;) because I might want to do it
3/8/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: When did they send that?
3/8/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I dont know, I just know that quit a few have already received it
3/8/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So Ill just wait a day or something
3/8/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And then email them I guess
3/8/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I got it too..
3/8/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: When?
3/8/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay then it's obvious they make mistakes
3/8/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Go ahead and mail them Tom
3/8/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: LOL
3/8/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Anne, are you supposed to have it as well?
3/8/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
3/8/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ehh 10:31 this morning
3/8/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's not a personal one so I could send it to you two if you'd like?
3/8/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just contains general info
3/8/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I didnt check my mail yet
3/8/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: After 10:30
3/8/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I got it too
3/8/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Got it too
3/8/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I might want to do the high tech systems track
3/8/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I haven't checked any tracks yet
3/8/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: It costs so much time tho
3/8/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Don't even know if I'm competent enough tbh
3/8/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: 2 of my friends are doing honors atm and theyre both super busy
3/8/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: And im already quite busy atm :/
3/8/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: One of em got a awesome project and has like 40k to spend on it or smth
3/8/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Already got 4 subjects/quartile so that won't work well...
3/8/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It says you get 30 credits for a track over two years
3/8/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah 15 esc per year
3/8/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: But do you still have to do all the other courses?
3/8/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: If you want to continue after year 1 you need all your studypoints and do the honors well
3/8/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Yes
3/8/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I think
3/8/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Its on top of all the usual stuff
3/8/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Seems like a lot
3/8/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: However i think not many ppl do the second year
3/8/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, for the really awesome jobs there are two possibilities basically:
3/8/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 1. Do honors and get a very good resumé academic-wise
3/8/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 2. Get to know the right people
3/8/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Honors does both of that
3/8/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So thats a reason why you want honors
3/8/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: True, it seems interesting for that
3/8/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I don't know what they are about though
3/8/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, with 2 I meant a bestuursjaar or lots of commitees
3/8/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Also very true
3/8/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Planning to do senaat? Haha
3/8/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No senaat, but I am kinda planning on a bestuursjaar, yes
3/8/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: But with honors you will be in contact with a lot of big companies in the tech world as well
3/8/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Nice
3/8/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: For what exactly?
3/8/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I hope GEWIS/wervingsdagen
3/8/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Otherwise Bata seems pretty cool, or Imma do some heavy commitees
3/8/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Cool, how many courses can you expect to pass while doing a bestuursjaar there?
3/8/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm
3/8/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Idk
3/8/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: You need some if you want a bestuursbeurs
3/8/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I think
3/8/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The current board is doing anywhere between 0 and 3
3/8/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I mean senaat is fulltime so they might try to pass 1 course each Q butthats tops
3/8/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Yea
3/8/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: The leningen are demotivating to do bestuur tho haha

3/8/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, you have for each hour 60*60 states
3/8/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 60 minutes and 60 seconds, so 3600 possible combinations
3/8/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And on an analog clock, there are 12 hours
3/8/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So the total amount of states is 12*3600
3/8/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If you then remove the hours, you get 12 times less states
3/8/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: oh like that
3/8/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: Didnt see they were talking about an analog clock

3/8/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: an elementary type has only one property
3/8/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: while a compound type has more properties using it
3/8/17, 16:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: aaah ok now I get it

3/9/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 5a from DS, they say draw a red/black tree of height 4 with the minimum number of nodes, does that mean that if there is one route where the height is 4, the rest less, the height is still 4
3/9/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes
3/9/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Hint for 5a: look in the slides of the ppt lol
3/9/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: they never told you how to build one
3/9/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: lol I see, but I already have one now
3/9/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: does anyone know what they mean with the "relations" and the assumptions for these relations in part 12 of the modelling assignment
3/9/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 12 is derivations?
3/9/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 12 is basically doing the same with the tables as they do in the lectures of week 4
3/9/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: oh sorry i meant 10 !😅
3/9/17, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Put the assumptions of 12 also at 10 or something?
3/9/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what do you mean? in 10 you need to give the quantaties and their values, types and categories
3/9/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and units
3/9/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: theres nothing about relations and assumptions in 10
3/9/17, 17:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: listen to maquetes he is top macho knows his shit :}
3/9/17, 17:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 10/10 Microsoft best worker we never had

3/9/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: look at the template. it says at 10 that we have to write down what kind of relation (equation, function etc.) there is between the quantities and we have to make assumptions about those relations
3/9/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: but i dont understand shit of it
3/9/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah, they mean which quantities influence eachother
3/9/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: but how can you make an assumption about that?
3/9/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk the template is very vague sometimes
3/9/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: you dont say
3/10/17, 01:37 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Interim grades modelling are online

3/10/17, 02:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Go to modeling
3/10/17, 02:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Search for grades
3/10/17, 02:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And you'll find them
3/10/17, 02:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They're kind of hidden
3/10/17, 07:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: where is grades
3/10/17, 07:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: under modeling
3/10/17, 07:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Modelling oncourse then underneat click grades then there is grade
3/10/17, 07:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh i found it

3/10/17, 09:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is "mineralling" a verb?
3/10/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: For you it is
3/11/17, 12:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys could you please help me with 3a?
In hash table should all keys distribute equally or it can be like this?
3/11/17, 12:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: (Slow internet pic is uploading)

3/11/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Think about the pigeonhole principle ;)
3/11/17, 13:00 - Luke Houben: Cs-students will be offline for maintenance and updates. Stay put
3/11/17, 13:06 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I know but for example
3/11/17, 13:06 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: If we m = 3 and n = 3
3/11/17, 13:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: IUI can be 12
3/11/17, 13:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: And then if distribute them equally
3/11/17, 13:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Then in every slot there will be 4 keys
Which is not n
3/11/17, 13:09 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Oh wait I think I get it
3/11/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: how did you people draw the trees in excercises 4 and 5? using paint, or by hand and scanning it in?

3/11/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: or did you use a special program for it
3/11/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Which can export to LaTeX
3/11/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Tikz package in LaTeX
3/11/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: where can I find IPE?

3/11/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Asking questions for literally everything is not a very good philosophy to live by dude
3/11/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: you can also be less hateful about these things
3/11/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: OH MY GOD, ITS A WONDER YOU'RE ALIVE, SINCE YOU PROBABLY WERE TO STUPID TO FIND A NIPPLE TO SUCK ON AS A BABY

3/11/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I think you have to use structural induction
3/11/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: haven't done it yet
3/11/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I was going  trough the slides from doctor king but it's vague
3/11/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it is, I think there may be better stuff online.
3/11/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: If you find it let me know

3/11/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Obviously lost weight, she's tilting your whole screen with the old video
3/11/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: Gotta say this is the funniest thing I've seen here after slowed down Jan Friso
3/11/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For the video lectures be carefull
3/11/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Speckmann said they were very outdated
3/11/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And she didn't want them on there
3/11/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I follow them with slides soooo slides should be trustable
3/11/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well I know some girls with videos on the internet they didn't want there
3/11/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Doesn't mean they're bad

3/11/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah but this came from Speckmann during het kringgesprek she wasn't happy that they were online to say the least
3/11/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hmm nice
3/11/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but isn't that always the case?
3/11/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I mean sometimes they earn money from it after all and it just bleeds out
3/11/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then maybe she should make sure that new ones are uploaded?
3/11/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exactly
3/11/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, DS is also one of the few subject without practice exams online
3/11/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Speckmann is against all of it. She want you to be there on during the lectures
3/11/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm normally against it but the way she explained it I could understand her

3/11/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But there are no exams on the official channels, thats what I mean
3/11/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: But what if I'm sick?
3/11/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No idea
3/11/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: too bad

3/11/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: @31642007885 Did you figure out how to do the induction for your algorithm in question 6 yet?
3/11/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: No not really I just did something and hoped it's correct
3/11/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Don't we all..

3/11/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: Oops sorry wrong chat
3/12/17, 13:24 - ‪+351 935 579 164‬: How did you give 6 results?
3/12/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just return an integer number
3/12/17, 13:28 - ‪+351 935 579 164‬: but it's supposed to be for each node x (belonging to) T
3/12/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes but you want to know the total number of nodes in the subtree starting from x
3/12/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And every x is part of T and T goes to n which are important to know when you want to proof your algo is correct
3/12/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: are your proofs for 5c also not that long? I feel like I might be missing out on some crucial info with this short of a proof
3/12/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Joost, PM me yours, ours is not long either
3/12/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: While it makes perfect sense
3/12/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Should we proof 6 with structural induction ?
3/12/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: holy fuck dude calm the fuck down
3/12/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so triggered shit
3/12/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i dont know
3/12/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: struggling with that one as well
3/12/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: I did structural induction
3/12/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Found it quite easy imo
3/12/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Just divide them into the left and right subtree as in the slides
3/12/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Because it had smaller nodes it correcly calculates the amount of nides of both subtree
3/12/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Erc
3/12/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Etc
3/12/17, 16:05 - ‪+351 935 579 164‬: but you want to do that for every node
3/12/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Where does the 38 go in question 1    in the quiz this week, don't get what to do when, after the probing, it points to a full slot
3/12/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: then it goes to the next
3/12/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: i = i+1
3/12/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Then you need to continue probing
3/12/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah so just do i+1
3/12/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Okay thanks :)
3/12/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: jup
3/12/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: np complete
3/12/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
3/12/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: np complete
3/12/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lul de behanger
3/12/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I had 38 in the end at position 0
3/12/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Huh😂
3/12/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I have 4 in position 0
3/12/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: @31647311973 can explain that
3/12/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Why in position 0😱
3/12/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Guys, I wrote a small Python program to insert the items according to the algorithms from the slides, and the resulting list was [38, 29, 0, 0, 21, 4, 6, 0, 8, 42, 0]
3/12/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: So it should just be that
3/12/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Python ❤
3/12/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I know right
3/12/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hmm the question now is why
3/12/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Can you send me your python file ? Would like to see it :)
3/12/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Sure
3/12/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks :)
3/12/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
3/12/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: i being the iteration you're at
3/12/17, 18:13 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, I think that is correct. I thought it was better explained on the wiki page though
3/12/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I just filled it in, and looked at what happened. I got the same result as the python program did, so it looks to be done alright
3/12/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Same
3/12/17, 19:32 - Casper Smits: does anyone have any tips about exercise 5c?
3/12/17, 19:32 - Casper Smits: for Data Structures
3/12/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: update your notepad++ version: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.3.3-fix-cia-hacking-issue.html
3/12/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Thanks
3/12/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Do you know if this one was instantly pushed or is on the 7-day waiting list?
3/12/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is the program list of Vault7 big?
3/12/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's quite extensive yes
3/12/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But seeing as it is being rumoured that this is just a very small portion of the full Vault7 "portfolio" going round the list might be a lot larger
3/12/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: It feels like updating notepad++ doesn't do jack shit, it just fixes one hole
3/12/17, 19:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hey do you get this on q1  quiz  and is that how you place crosshair just to be sure 😅🐒
3/12/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes but every small portion helps
3/12/17, 19:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
3/12/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That's what I had
3/12/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Looks correct to me
3/12/17, 19:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Niiice i like the crosshair style
3/12/17, 19:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Immersive
3/12/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And this
3/12/17, 19:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Now put crosshair on my head and kill myself
3/12/17, 19:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
3/12/17, 19:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @kindpeopleofthisgroupthatarelovingandcaringanddontpromoteracismorminorityhate 🐒
3/12/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Yeah
3/12/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The first one is the same as I have, the second one I am examining atm
3/12/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Had the same answer
3/12/17, 19:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also what do you use to draw on 5 ?
3/12/17, 19:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I mean 4
3/12/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Tikzedt and some manual LaTeX
3/12/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But IPE and exporting to EPS also works
3/12/17, 19:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😓i was hoping for some easy draw io shit but i will see ipe
3/12/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, are you using LaTeX?
3/12/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You can import pictures into LaTeX just fine
3/12/17, 19:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah i know but i remeber they gave us a site for fundamentals for automatons that was really easy and quick to use
3/12/17, 19:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Madeby alan or some shit like that
3/12/17, 19:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Anyone rememers it ?
3/12/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Its still on the subreddit
3/12/17, 19:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Aah oki
3/12/17, 19:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Forgot about that place
3/12/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Second one also incorrect
3/12/17, 19:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Incorrect ?
3/12/17, 19:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What do you mean incorrect ?
3/12/17, 19:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Typo  ??
3/12/17, 19:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐋kees dont yoke me
3/12/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: The sequences a and b are not correct
3/12/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: In your picture
3/12/17, 19:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ah oki
3/12/17, 19:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh shit you are right

3/12/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: D is could be a correct sequence
3/12/17, 19:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 👴🏿🙏🏿
3/12/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Good ol' paint.net
3/12/17, 20:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: hue I am using draw .io
3/12/17, 20:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: looks ok
3/12/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: <Media omitted>
3/12/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Can be either
3/12/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: no it can't
3/12/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: 2 can't be red.
3/12/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: We're gonna hear more about them later
3/12/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: because then the amount of black nodes to all leaves wouldn't be equal
3/12/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 38558225‬: U need 3 blacks
3/12/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 38558225‬: So 2 needs to be black
3/12/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Oh yeah, that's right
3/12/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: O forgot about that rule
3/12/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Oh I see thanks guys :)
3/12/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: How did you guys create the tree in 3c? Did you just say T=binary-search-tree?
3/12/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: for i=1 to n
3/12/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: add
3/12/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, but how did you create the empty tree?
3/12/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or just not?
3/12/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: i used a hash table for 3c
3/12/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, yeah, thats what I mean, I'm sorry
3/12/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: chained hash insert
3/12/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, but did you say somewhere something like T = Hash-Table
3/12/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or did you just start inserting into some hash table?
3/12/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: just inserting
3/12/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay, thanks
3/12/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: because you can assume there is a hash function so i guess there is a table
3/12/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, I was a bit confused with programming
3/12/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Where you first have to declare a variable before you can use it
3/12/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You can always add a line like Let T[1..n] be a new hash table, that takes O(1) and then start inserting
3/12/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, I changed my solution to not using a hash table anymore :X
3/12/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because I couldn't find an algorithm
3/12/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But still thanks @31610720282 , you da real MVP, you know it
3/12/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: does anyone know how to do 6?
3/12/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: in data structures?
3/12/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: i did induction+case distinction
3/12/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: don't try a loop invariant
3/12/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: there is no loop
3/12/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: it's all in your head
3/12/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: alright thanks, I will try to do that
3/12/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: we did* pardon Tom
3/13/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: How much do the grades for the conceptual and formal model count for your total modeling grade?
3/13/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: From what I understood quite a small percentage, but the complete model will account for 40%
3/13/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And the grades for conceptual and formal will be a small amount of that 40%
3/13/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So it's not like Conceptual 10%, Formal 10%, Final 20%?
3/13/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: something like that yes
3/13/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think
3/13/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or it was even that they together count for 1/3 and the final for 2/3 of the 40% total
3/13/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 1/6 , 1/6, 2/3
3/13/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: does anyone know how to download the modeling lectures to watch them in the train?
3/13/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: i tried some things but none of them worked
3/13/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: you can use chrome and open the lecture on your phone to watch it there
3/13/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and at the lower right corner there is a download button to download it
3/13/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Thanks!
3/13/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 14336980‬: Tope

3/13/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I haven't been able to use it in weeks but I think that's because of my phone
3/13/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah you also had issues with the sidebar in myTUe :p
3/13/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I need a new one I guess
3/13/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: I have the same problem on my phone 
But planon still works on pc👌🏻
3/13/17, 19:25 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yeah the pc works but it's nice to just use your phone quickly
3/13/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Guys for data structures A5, 4.a; I end up with too many black leaves after the two "standard" rotations.. Should you do more rotations than the usual 2?
3/13/17, 20:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: HAH A5
3/13/17, 20:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its monday

3/13/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Try having a look at the example in the book
3/13/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dont need more than 2 hours?
3/13/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Examples of LEFT-ROTATE or RB-INSERT?
3/13/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: +-20min
3/13/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: More than 2 rotations Max
3/13/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You can also fix it by rotating 42 to the root and fixing the colors afterwards haha
3/13/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Nevermind, missed a NIL-node
3/13/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
3/13/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
3/13/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: c is wrong
3/13/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: You can't start with a red node
3/13/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: root is black
3/13/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, fuck
3/13/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, thanks
3/13/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I didn't even notice it 😅
3/13/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So only a and b?
3/13/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: yes darling
3/14/17, 09:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys this would be the correct reading for the first input right? %00000010
3/14/17, 09:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: (with a pp2)
3/14/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Like input 1, not first input as in input 0
3/14/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because for some reason this is always being read as high even if there's nothing connected to that input
3/14/17, 09:39 - Luke Houben: First input? Most right button?
3/14/17, 09:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No input 1
3/14/17, 09:39 - Luke Houben: Ah yes, if the second most right button is pressed you get that
3/14/17, 09:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah thought so hmm then there an error somehwere else
3/14/17, 09:41 - Luke Houben: Do you get %00000010 from [R5+INPUT] even while the button is not pressed or what's going on
3/14/17, 09:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah even when there's nothing connected to that input it is being read as high
3/14/17, 09:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: An that was setting some values in our program
3/14/17, 09:47 - Luke Houben: Wow that's weird
3/14/17, 09:49 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You sure you didn't shortcircuit your pp2?
3/14/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Pretty sure yes.. It's just that input too
3/14/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The others are working fine
3/14/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: guys where can i find the examination dates
3/14/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: because this website is not working: https://studyguide.tue.nl/programs/graduate-school/masters-programs-phasing-out/computer-science-and-engineering/examination-schedules/
3/14/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: which is linked in /r/softwarescience2016
3/14/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: if you go to the timetable and go forward a bunch
3/14/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: you can see the examinations for this quarter
3/14/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: it lacks one: 2ID40		Human technology interaction
3/14/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: does that one have a final examination?
3/14/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: not sure, are you certain you  entered the course?
3/14/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: it is in "inscrijvingen->cursussen" in osiris, but not in "inschrijvingen->toetsen"
3/14/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 2ID40 does not have a final examination
3/14/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: what is 2ID40?
3/14/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: human technology interaction
3/14/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: okay thanks
3/14/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: *according to osiris*
3/14/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dont quote me on that
3/14/17, 12:07 - Bas Gieling: "that" - Max, 2017
3/14/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks bas
3/14/17, 12:19 - Bas Gieling: yw
3/14/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Does anyone here follow AI and have a good score for Perceptron? I need help
3/14/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: How did you manage to follow AI? We didn't have any electives this quartile right? :p
3/14/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Well, not necessarily. But if you wanted to follow AI, this was the best time to schedule it in
3/14/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Ahh alright
3/14/17, 13:05 - Bart van Dooren: Is the data structure exam not in the timetable because it doesn't show up? But also on osiris it doesn't say i have a test for it only the homework assigments
3/14/17, 13:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: New system is still shit
3/14/17, 13:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Study desk confirmed it
3/14/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Hahaha
3/14/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 18553291‬: I follow AI
3/14/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: What is your score for Perceptron so far?
3/14/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Because nothing I try gets my score above 60
3/14/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What is AI?
3/14/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Then what course did you skip this quartile? Doing embedded next quartile or what?
3/14/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Artificial int?
3/14/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Y
3/14/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Think so at least XD
3/14/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ah cool
3/14/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 18553291‬: I currently have 90
3/14/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 18553291‬: Have you implemented the basic algorithm?
3/14/17, 13:19 - Bas Gieling: combined maths & sfs always get embedded systems next quartile
3/14/17, 13:19 - Bas Gieling: & we have elective this quartile instead x)
3/14/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Ahh alright, I get it
3/14/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 18553291‬: Cause if you add things like better initial weight vector and R shifting that decreases my score. If you only implement basic algorithm with bias you can already get 90 points
3/14/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: O, wow, I'll try that, then. Thanks!
3/14/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 18553291‬: Good luck
3/14/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wait
3/14/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: was AI an elective for year1?
3/14/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Not always, we could've chosen to do embedded systems this quartile and an elective next quartile
3/14/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think it's usually year 2, but you can also so it in year 1 of you prefer
3/14/17, 13:25 - Bas Gieling: usually then :(
3/14/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: rip bas
3/14/17, 13:26 - Bas Gieling: i got ript
3/14/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: god anne youre such a smart ass jesus christ
3/14/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: god max youre such a dick jesus christ
3/14/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: *god max youre such a person who says what everyone is thinking jesus christ
3/14/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Pluralistic ignorance is king here
3/14/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: @31628151420 is king here*
3/14/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31624553225 is king here*
3/14/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Can you send me your code? I've tried just the basic algorithm and I still get just 60 points
3/14/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thank you, my dear subject, but I am just a prophet of the faith of Lok, which you should all worship btw, because he is awesome af, so I don't deserve this kind hearted words of me being your king. I'm a normal human like the rest of you
3/14/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Lok and Mjet go hand in hand
3/14/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: they are the saviors of the world
3/14/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: once apocalypse comes, they will give enlightment and bring peace and balance to the world
3/14/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Martin tried this :p
3/14/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 18553291‬: What happened to Martin?
3/14/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: ?

3/14/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Oh like that
3/14/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Never forget Jan Friso
3/14/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: rip martin
3/14/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: he just wanted to help and wanted to be a good person
3/14/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 83411377‬: Yeah, rip Martin
3/14/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: but someone was just too lazy to change some sentences
3/14/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: `what happened to him after?
3/14/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: did he just fail the course or sth worse?
3/14/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: fontys
3/14/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: oh no, not the fonys 😕 that's just plain cruel
3/14/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Mandatory Re-Take of Exam, regardless of grade, no points for A3, and registert as a fraud 😑
3/14/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: *registered
3/14/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: what a bunch of dicks
3/14/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ikrrr
3/14/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just because our big friend Tim Groenen decided to submit the exact same doc under a different name
3/14/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: thats not very wise
3/14/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's plain rude and stupid
3/14/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should've stoned him for it
3/14/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: What happened to that guy then?
3/14/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: he went to fontys
3/14/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: lmao
3/14/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I dont think he did... I think he was too late for that
3/14/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Is that guy still in this whatsapp group?😂
3/14/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope
3/14/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He wanted to do so though
3/14/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: He handed in his tu backpack yday
3/14/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: So idk
3/14/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: He texted me he wanted to do hbo next year
3/14/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: We share a friendgroup from high school
3/14/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah he told us the academic approach just doesn't work for him
3/14/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yeah that
3/14/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Is anyone having trouble with the assembler for the PP2? When debugging step by step, when it gets to a BRS it branches to a completely wrong line...
3/14/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Ruben had the same problem if i remember correctly
3/14/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: YES
3/14/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I fixed it with the help of @31647311973
3/14/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Did you manage to solve it?
3/14/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's your timer interrupt
3/14/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: #hoedan
3/14/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah it's fucked up pp2 logic
3/14/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Like really fucked up
3/14/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Put your timer interrupt at the top of your code
3/14/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And put a jump in front of it that jumps to the main routine
3/14/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That fixed it for us
3/14/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Spend over 4 hours on that shit
3/14/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: So put the ISR at the top of the code?
3/14/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes like this:
3/14/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
3/14/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That fixed it for us
3/14/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Thanks man! Much appreciated. We'll try that!
3/14/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Np np, thanks @31647311973 too he helped us out
3/14/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If it doesn't work PM me
3/14/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well that's obvious considering fraud is not allowed in academic institutions
3/14/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Can still do that, just costs a month more money you don't get back
3/14/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Tim is just really lazy
3/14/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
3/14/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Tell me about it
3/14/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Took him 8 hours to make a powerpoint that me and Kees finished in like 1 hour, and ours was much more complicated
3/14/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: you guys are so nice, talking about him negativly in a groupschat with 176 people, without him in it
3/14/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Uhu
3/14/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Wasn't that why this groupchat made in the first place?
3/14/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because of questionguy
3/14/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: True story
3/14/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: No, I created it so we could easily communicate, not to talk shit about someone
3/14/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: can confirm, luuk is right
3/14/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ok didn't know that
3/14/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: You didn't create THIS group but I know what u mean
3/14/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Then kudos to you Luuk for taking it up for Tim I guess
3/14/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: The spam chat was created for question guy and this chat was created for people to talk about the study
3/14/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: For or because *
3/14/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: That chat walked out of the hand, it was intentionally for proper communication
3/14/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I ment the other one..
3/14/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Studyrelated: do not commit fraud like they explain during every course introduction and kickoff meeting
3/14/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: You are not to keeping
3/14/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Don't share your homework at all they said
3/14/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah well we know how it works Job 😋
3/14/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I think we kinda failed that one laready
3/14/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Everyone shares and cooperates somehow
3/14/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Even scientists share
3/14/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah that's true but it is still shitty to just steal it
3/14/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: Je suis Martin
3/14/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just use your own words and make your own implementation of ideas
3/14/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Look for inspiration in other works don't copy it
3/14/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Heil Hydra
3/14/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This exactly
3/14/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: DS is posted I think
3/14/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Assignment 4 atleast

3/14/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Kut jong 😂😂😂
3/15/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is it true that today's lecture of data structures does not cover exam material? because the quiz does contain a question about today's subject
3/15/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Speckmann said it would not be in the exam at the end of the lecture on monday
3/15/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: To attend or not to attend
3/15/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: That is the question
3/15/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nah
3/15/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lol
3/15/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: To still be at home is the answer
3/15/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I'm going because I need to vote in Eindhoven
3/15/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lol
3/15/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I was like heeuuh we can vote at TUe
3/15/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh shit I live in Tilburg
3/15/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: #kiezerspas
3/15/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah didn't hear that in time
3/15/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Confusing names though
3/15/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Stempas and kiezerspas being different items
3/15/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Yeah me too
3/15/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I always get confused between anus and vagina
3/15/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I was like, huh, that's convenient
3/15/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just as confusing
3/15/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Keep getting reminded
3/15/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: 🤔
3/15/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Whoops sorry Turtle, no spam

3/15/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Look at the slides from today's lecture, it was discussed in the last part
3/15/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But Speckman hinted us not to come :o
3/15/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: So the room would be more quiet
3/15/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: Good for her, not for you
3/15/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Idk either but it wasnt necessary for the assignment
3/15/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: So maybe she meant that only
3/15/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Actually it is necessary for the assifnment
3/15/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Or useful at least
3/15/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Only for the quiz
3/15/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Which she then probably deemed "less important"
3/15/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Guys has anyone tried installing multiple timer interrupts?
3/15/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: yes rubain?
3/15/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nope but it shouldn't be to hard
3/15/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Wat?
3/15/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: oh i thought you had a question
3/15/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No
3/15/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nonono
3/15/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Did you do 6 already?
3/15/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You managed to do it without lecture 9 stuff :0
3/15/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 6 from the quiz or the exercises
3/15/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Exercises
3/15/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I didn't use any stuff from today's lecture I think
3/15/17, 18:49 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: I havent done it yet, but you can do it without todays lecture as it only covers intervals
3/15/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: The slides of todays lecture are definaly useful for exercise 6 though.
3/15/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: Don't forget to vote today guys ^^
3/15/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Dont forget to stem blanco
3/15/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: or 50+
3/15/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ...?
3/15/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Leeg papier inleveren
3/15/17, 19:24 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: That is counted as non-voters party probs
3/15/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: When you vote blanco you support the democracy but do not support any of the political parties
3/15/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: when you dont vote, you basically say fk democracy
3/15/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: There should be a rule that just if enough people vote Blanco there is just an empty seat
3/15/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: but that would mean less democracy
3/15/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: whereas they said democracy is good by voting blanco
3/15/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If less than 50% of the dutch population doesnt vote the vote wouldnt count
3/15/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: So thats why its possible to vote blanco
3/15/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: You support whatever the rest of the voters supports
3/15/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so if more than 50% does vote the vote doesnt count
3/15/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: nice
3/15/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
3/15/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: So what I actually mean is: when it's a left child of its grandparent but right child of its parent is it still case 1?
3/15/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Niels check the algo in the book
3/15/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It makes more sense
3/15/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh okay thanks
3/16/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Guys, what are you implementing to have error handling on for example the LED's or sensors, for your embedded systems project ?
3/16/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Code
3/16/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: This
3/16/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, we have some parts that are unique to our hardware design, but we also got some timers n stuff
3/16/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah just code it in
3/16/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: 😂 thanks
3/16/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Are you allowed to assume some cables won't be pulled ?
3/16/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope
3/16/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: :(
3/16/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I mean, you can assume it, but you won't get full points for error detection then
3/16/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You should decide if it is worth the time investment to make your code able to detect certain errors or not
3/16/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: they will only pull one cable at a time
3/16/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: so you won't be left with a fully disconnected pp2
3/16/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah alright
3/16/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: yes, they won't pull the power or USB cable for example :p
3/16/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: When they do, you just start screaming ERROR
3/16/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys is there a max amount of lines your code can have for the pp2?
3/16/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: me_irl
3/16/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We just exceeded the 900 lines and it seems to be chrashing now
3/16/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: To answer your question, probably
3/16/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: not lines, but the ROM has a limited amount of data that can be stored there
3/16/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What's the ROM?
3/16/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: it's probs RAM in he pp2, but the place where teh program is stored
3/16/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Read Only Memory
3/16/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I have seen a guy with 1000 lines, so it should be fine
3/16/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: lines don't matter
3/16/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: it's all about space
3/16/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yeh, but you can assume that it would still take up more space than 900
3/16/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: we could test it by making a 3MB file with STOR 5 R0 repeated a lot of times
3/16/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Let's hope the compiler isn't smart enough to notice
3/16/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you really think their compiler would check that?
3/16/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You don't know how strong weaponized autism can be
3/16/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: the whole pp2 software package is a steaming pile of disappointment and erros
3/16/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
3/16/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: on the scale of 1 to 10 I'd say Trump
3/16/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: or Denk
3/16/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Thanks to MR. KJH JILISSEN for supporting cs-students :)

3/16/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: what is the black height in a tree with just a root? 1 or two? should you count the NIL leaves?
3/16/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 1 right?
3/16/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No nil leave counting afaik
3/16/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah thought so too but i'm getting confused :/
3/16/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah, you don't count the NIL leaves
3/16/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: ok thanks
3/16/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: !
3/16/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah it's confusing me all the time too lol
3/16/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: <Media omitted>
3/16/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Anyone know this
3/16/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: ?
3/16/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: i guessed eventrually
3/16/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: <Media omitted>
3/16/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: since the option i thought was right wasn't in therer :'_
3/16/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: :')
3/16/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Hahah
3/16/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: What did u guess
3/16/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Im with you
3/16/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: oh you don't count x, that's the thing alright
3/16/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: i forgot haha
3/16/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: You want to take the four points with x-coordinates 5, 6, 7 and 8, and sort those by their y-coord
3/16/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: So
3/16/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: A
3/16/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: <Media omitted>
3/16/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think the resulting tree is:
        4
  1         5
1  4    5  7
3/16/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Have the sane
3/16/17, 14:28 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, could you please help 
How are we supposed to prove the correctness for 6?
3/16/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I have the crazy
3/16/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 6 of DS?
3/16/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Loop invariant
3/16/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It depends on your algo though
3/16/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: I really can't come up with a useful augmentation
3/16/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: At 6?
3/16/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Use an augmentation of an RB tree
3/16/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I didn't use a augmented data structure
3/16/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or, not one I augmented myself
3/16/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: But what information do you store?
3/16/17, 14:35 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: But what if I have 3 loops in algo
3/16/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then you are probably doing something wrong
3/16/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or I am
3/16/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Log n time with loops? gl
3/16/17, 14:36 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Like "while" loop the same way did it in presentation
3/16/17, 14:36 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: They did*
3/16/17, 14:40 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: They are not witching each other
3/16/17, 14:40 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Like 
Loop+
Loop+
Loop
3/16/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, I think you need to prove it thrice then
3/16/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: what augmentation did you guys use for 6?
3/16/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: because you can do both with just a normal red black tree right?
3/16/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: because i don't really see the use in a OS-tree...
3/16/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Not with a normal red black tree but with an augmented red black tree yes
3/16/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah that's what i meant, but what augmentation did you guys use, because i heard everyone screaming OS-tree but I don't see how that would solve the issue
3/16/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I'm thinking about storing everything up to x in the node and then I just find X1 and x2 and subtract them or something
3/16/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But inserting is hard that way
3/16/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I know
3/16/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: It can only store info about its children to maintain log n
3/16/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: <Media omitted>
3/16/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: No but i know the answer tho
3/16/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I'd like to know the theory though :p
3/16/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If you know the theory tell me😜
3/16/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Okay, if you do the same if you find out
3/16/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Can't you just say that e^x / (e^x+5) becomes basically 1 and cancel them out
3/16/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: guys 5.a from ds what does ancestor mean?
3/16/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: all the nodes directly above it?
3/16/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I think it means just a node that Is above that node
3/16/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: As in: parent, grandparent, parent of grandparent
3/16/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Etc
3/16/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: "Adding etc to sound more intelligent"
3/16/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But its tru
3/16/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: More intelligent would have been "(great-)*grandparent" instead of "Parent of grandparent"
3/16/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Except you can't write your homework in regular expressions
3/16/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Why not
3/16/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Because it's the wrong course for that.
3/16/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Thats -2 @31647311973
3/17/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
3/17/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ?
3/17/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's a very lazy way of copy pasta, but indeed, can anyone confirm this ;p
3/17/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It depends on which call to RB-Transplant you mean
3/17/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: U is always z, but v can be z.left, z.right or y
3/17/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: THanks!
3/17/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Can we load a value in the timer?
3/17/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Only add a value
3/17/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If you STOR R0 [R5+TIMER], Timer = Timer + R0
3/17/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So we cant decide what the value is?
3/17/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Well if you first LOAD R0 [R5+TIMER], Then MULS R0 -1, Then STOR R0 [R5+TIMER]
3/17/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Timer = ~0
3/17/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Then LOAD R0 NEWVALUE, STOR R0 [R5+TIMER], Timer = ~NEWVALUE
3/17/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Lol wtf😂
3/17/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Thats one way of setting the timer to a certain value
3/17/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How would that set the timer to 0?😂
3/17/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You add a value to like 25632
3/17/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Timer + -Timer = 0
3/17/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Then subtract that same value
3/17/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Should be the original value in the timer m
3/17/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
3/17/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just a few more days tops iirc
3/17/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: We lost
3/17/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: already?
3/17/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Lol dunno
3/17/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: But if it ends in 12 days no way we can get 500 more than delft
3/17/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why not
3/17/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ruben, one other guy and myself have like 6-7% of Eindhoven's total ducks.
Meaning there are a lot of people that didn't do anything
3/17/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I got 83 is that good?
3/17/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well I recon it is above average
3/17/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I got 409
3/17/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And Ruben has way more
3/17/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: <Media omitted>
3/17/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah if people would've put in effort as they did with that Kutmus
3/17/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: You know why? People don't care about ducks, but they do care about "Kutmus" as you call it
3/17/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Where I call I my lord and saviour
3/17/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well I understand a lot of people don't care about the ducks since a lot of noobs still use Word for their academic papers
3/17/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But why the hell do they like that Kutmus
3/17/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: :p
3/17/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Someone uploaded it to Facebook and everyone was like heeuuh jump the hypetrain meeloperts
3/17/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: wrong chat luuk
3/17/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: and daan
3/17/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: turtle Job save us
3/17/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: 🐢🐇
3/17/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Why are we talking about the "kutmus"
3/17/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exactly my question
3/17/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because the moroccans who are destroying our country /s
3/17/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Keep it serious
3/17/17, 14:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys am i the only one who cant see every final exam in the timetable in mytue
3/17/17, 14:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And weird thing is that a few days ago i could see data structures on 10
3/17/17, 14:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And today i cant
3/17/17, 14:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Pls confirm
3/17/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: You are not the only one
3/17/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Are there other people that don't have a loop at 6?
3/17/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/17/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: At the moment I don't have any answer at 6
3/17/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: lol
3/17/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ruben has though
3/17/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes and no
3/17/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I've got @31628151420 who is my answer to everything
3/17/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Schrödingers answer
3/17/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hey that's cheating
3/17/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I use that method as well
3/17/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So basically I could just skip the middle man and ask Nick :p
3/17/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep
3/17/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Nick is bae
3/17/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: o/
3/17/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: Does anyone know a good way to document assembly code?
3/17/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Comments, and shitloads of them?
3/17/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: No, like exporting it to word
3/17/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: because it is impossible to just copy it, I want those nice colours and stuf
3/17/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then I'd say: There is probably a LaTeX package for that
3/17/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: \usepackage{assemblyPsudoAlgoTex}
3/17/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: :P
3/17/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: When talking about the black-height of a node, do you need to use the maximum or minimum black-height
3/17/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: For DS A5 q6 do you use a range tree or a red black tree
3/17/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I used an OS-tree
3/17/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wait, I am fucking stupid
3/17/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Not because of the OS-tree, but because of that previous question :P
3/17/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because by the definition of a RB-tree, the amount of black nodes on a path is the same
3/17/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay, nevermind, have a nice day
3/17/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Rick why you do this to me?
3/17/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: What?
3/17/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Spamming after my question 😂
3/17/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I answered it!
3/17/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You said never mind ?
3/17/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: For DS A5 q6 do you use a range tree or a red black tree
3/17/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I used an OS-tree
3/17/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: RB tree but you have to augment it
3/17/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yeah I thought so but wanted confirmation
3/17/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
3/17/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so how does this asymptote stuff work?
3/17/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: like
3/17/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: is c always 0 for these cases
3/17/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Ja
3/17/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hmm

3/17/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: maar oke
3/17/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Fijn dat je gay oke vindt Stef
3/17/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Mooi te horen
3/17/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ja Kun jij je ook weer in mijn omgeving vertonen zonder constant angstig te hoeven zijn 😘
3/17/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Angstig voor jou?
3/17/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Huh
3/17/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wat
3/17/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hallo?

3/17/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Why are the course registration confirmation emails sent from "Universiteit Nederland", address: noreply@un.nl, where un.nl redirects to ad.nl?
3/17/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: The ones from Osiris? For me they are sent from a different email adress
3/17/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: NoRepliesDL@tue.nl
3/17/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Mh, interesting
3/17/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Isnt it a phishing mail?
3/17/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I got mine from NoRepliesDL@tue.nl too
3/17/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: <Media omitted>
3/17/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yes
3/17/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes
3/17/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Well, now I just go two email confirmations from noreply@tue.nl
3/17/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Weird stuff
3/17/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Guys can you login to mytue?
3/17/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is it just me, or is Osiris one big piece of shit?
3/17/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: No it's not just you
3/17/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Oase was less shit
3/17/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Exactly
3/18/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Its like; If you make something new, dont make it shittier than the thing ur replacing
3/18/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But somehow they Did manage to do So
3/18/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Its like they put a middelbare scholier on the job who has Almost No prior experience with even html
3/18/17, 09:23 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: they just hired 70 people with ruby on rails experience so now the site looks good and has no usability to speak of
3/18/17, 09:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Why don't we build our own style sheet that we lay over it?
3/18/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I don't think they have human readable css
3/18/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: thats MyTUe ur talking about right?
3/18/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cus yeah MyTUe is useless AF and osiris looks like crap...
3/18/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Why can't they just make one platform
3/18/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because TU/e?
3/18/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: It would be a good investment
3/18/17, 09:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: "decentralisatie is de toekomst"

3/18/17, 09:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: RIP
3/18/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nu willen ze juist weer terug naar één zorgfonds/systeem toch :p
3/18/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: nah, go right wing: people only get a database authentication code, make your own web app
3/18/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31642623926 , you said something about using an OS-tree for exercise 6
3/18/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I don't remember anything about an OS tree :p
3/18/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: My partner @31643470096  doesn't either
3/18/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Presentation 7, slide 18 onwards
3/18/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sorry, presentation 8
3/18/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ah thank you!
3/18/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: how do you make arctan in oncourse again?
3/18/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 1/tan(x)?
3/18/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Just type arctan
3/18/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: does that work?
3/18/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes

Would this give a valid method to solve exercise 6?

3/18/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Assuming you may build the datastructure in O( n) time
3/18/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But both actions only take log( n)
3/18/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Can you fuckup the log (n) height by inserting the right(or wrong) keys after each other?
3/18/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Uuh what do you mean?
3/18/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: A R-B tree corrects its self
3/18/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Can you DS become a glorified list?
3/18/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Meaning whether this one corrects itself or not?
3/18/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yeah
3/18/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ehhm
3/18/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: If I put the numbers in reverse order in there will it become a list
3/18/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: That's why I moved away from range trees
3/18/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: The building is fine but can it maintain the log (n) height
3/18/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: If you need to spent O(n) to get to the leafs the SUM can't be don't in Olog (n)
3/18/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Do you understand what I meant?
3/18/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hmmm
3/18/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/18/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And that's why we're stuck haha
3/18/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Cannot find a way to perform sum in log(n ) time
3/18/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What kind of solution brought peace to your search?
3/18/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I don't have one yet but , I am currently looking at a R-B tree
3/18/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: *whisper*OS-tree*whisper*

3/18/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: GUYS I HEARD A LITTLE BIRD WHISPER SOMETHING
3/18/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks both of you haha
3/18/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I'm thinking of storing the sum of the suntree rooted at x in the node and subtract the sub trees that don't belong
3/18/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Rick seems so confident that I'll try his approach
3/18/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Tried it, no luck
3/18/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: 🙃
3/18/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Looking into order augmentation, like in the slides
3/18/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Storing the node order so you know which path to follow
3/18/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31642623926  why an OS-tree though??
3/18/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Bettina said it: If you need to augment, always RB tree
3/18/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: ^ that
3/18/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh shit, Nick says something different than Rick.
Now this gets confusing
3/18/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, because an OS-tree is an RB-tree
3/18/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: As in like
3/18/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I think you only need 1 field
3/18/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is an already augmented RB-tree
3/18/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: not 2
3/18/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I think rick is do8ng the same as me
3/18/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Adding the order to the node such that you can use order statistics
3/18/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Me, @31643157069 and @31643222030 /@31628151420 are using the same sort of strategy
3/18/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: But if you have the order  of the tree but need to report the whole
Tree that takes O(n) time doesn't it? You need to sum parts of it right?
3/18/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: But an OS tree alone isn't enough right? In the worst case, you would have to add all the values from the smallest value to the largest value. If you only have the rank, how would you do that in logn time without looping through all nodes?
3/18/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: This.
3/18/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am still working on the exact implementation, but I think the OS-tree has potential
3/18/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: What about storing the intermediate values in the nodes of the tree? Don't know if someone brought that up yet
3/18/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: This?
3/18/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: yupp
3/18/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: i guess you discussed that already then
3/18/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I think it could work but the proof would be horrible
3/18/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: But I'm gonna do it fml
3/18/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I'm with you! I was actually working out a similar algorithm! :')
3/18/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: I can at least confirm that storing the sum of the left subtree and the sum of the right subtree doesn't work
3/18/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You can, look at the photo, if 31-40, you come at the node 46 it's bigger so you subtract the sum in 46 and go left check if it's smaller and add the sum in 39 because it's in the range
3/18/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: <Media omitted>
3/18/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/18/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There were more mistakes in these few algorithms I looked at for the first time now in this book which was "mandatory" for the course
3/18/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Kinda sucks donkeyballs :p
3/18/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Is it just the pdf or did they actually print these mistakes?
3/18/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I hope they didn't print them
3/18/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I have the PDF
3/18/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: it's also in the book
3/18/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lol
3/18/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Dang
3/18/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: And I almost considered giving them money for this
3/18/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: It's a pretty good and important book though
3/18/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Saying a book is absolutely necessary when it is not needed for 4-5 weeks and then it also contains stupid mistakes :p
3/18/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Until now Google knew it all
3/18/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Well it's needed unless you have the PDF
3/18/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Opened the PDF first time yesterday
3/18/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Guys, CLRS is one of the best books there is for computer science, and mistakes just happen
3/18/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is a 1400 page book, what do you expect?
3/18/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Amen
3/18/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh no I don't blame the book
3/18/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The guys who wrote it are amongst the best computer scientists in the world
3/18/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I just recall the first lecture where they stressed out that if you didn't have the book yet you should immediately get it
3/18/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And I just now had to open it to find like 2 algorithms
3/18/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I do not think the 'else' is missing actually haha... If you are at case 3, you also do case 4. It is not one or the other I thought.
3/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But then the alignment is off
3/18/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just add some tabs
3/18/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Should solve it😜
3/18/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Why? I feel like line 17 - 21 belong to the else in line 12? To, but again I might be completely wrong haha, the if statement in line 12 is a separate if statement. Not an elseif statement
3/18/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah should it or is the else missing for which they put the extra tabs :p
3/18/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Guys
3/18/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Why not store 2 extra values per node
3/18/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: 1 that contains the sum of the right part of the subtree
3/18/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: And 1 that stores the left part of the subtree
3/18/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Trying that, but there are some problems when trying to do it in logn time
3/18/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Inserting? Or with summing?
3/18/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Summing, my approach is to start at the minimum and work towards the root
3/18/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I think I got it to work (although a formal proof is not going to be easy...). But I did not add two fields. Just one with the sum of the keys of the nodes in the subtree rooted at x. If I then wanted the sum of the left part, I would do: sum[left[x]]
3/18/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: It would just be a tree walk right?
3/18/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: So if you examine node x, then if p[x]<b, that means the entire right subtree can be added
3/18/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: But if b is somewhere in a right subtree you get into trouble and your proof will take hundreds of pages if you want to do it in logn time
3/18/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: You can first try to find the split
3/18/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: And work from the minimum too the split
3/18/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: So basically b must be in the right subtree of the root because else your running time goes to the moon and the algo gets too complex to prove
3/18/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: What do you mean by split?
3/18/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: They talked about it in the lectures
3/18/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: let mee look it up
3/18/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: look at the powerpoint for Range Searching
3/18/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: dia 12
3/18/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Yes i'm sure this will work
3/18/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: and won't be too hard to prove. Not easy tho
3/18/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: By using an OS-tree?
3/18/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Why would you need an OS-tree for that
3/18/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Just use a red-black tree, i don't see why you can't
3/18/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh you need the sum of all keys, I thought the sum of the number of all keys
3/18/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I read it wrong, else having the size would be handy I think, but then a RB-tree works fine I think
3/18/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: yupp
3/18/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: A lot of 'I think' , cuz what do I know lol
3/18/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait we need the sum of the values in all those nodes right? Or only the amount of nodes for which it holds
3/18/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I thought it was the number of nodes, but it is the sum of the KEYS for which it holds. So yeah, you are right.
3/18/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So, if a = 1, and b = 3. Every key in between or equal to a added to a value
3/18/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But how is that log n?
3/18/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So suppose we have elements {1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5} and say bounds a = 2 and b = 4.
We would then get the sum 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 right?
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I think so yeah
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thought so as well
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh no actually
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: 4 and 4 dont count
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: not..? :p
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Because they are equal to b
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh yeah okay
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Same same ;p
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But they must be strictly smaller then b
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah I know ;) but still
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: can't harm to notice
3/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: ;)
3/18/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Let S be a set of distinct numbers
3/18/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: hence you cannot have 2 3's and 2 4;s
3/18/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah and that
3/18/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So maximum running time, with range searching, would be O(log n + (b-a))?
3/18/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: worst case*
3/18/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And thus O(log n)
3/18/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes, if you give an efficient algorithm
3/18/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, assuming adding the reported nodes to a value takes constant time, which it should
3/18/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: sum = sum + key[node]
3/18/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: seems pretty constant to me
3/18/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Jep
3/18/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: if you store the order of each node, you could solve it with a recursive algorithm right>
3/18/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: 4c
3/18/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: What's up with that?!
3/18/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: @31623837581 Don't think you need a recursive algorithm. Cant we just use the 1DquerySearch from the slides and add every reported node to a value. And if it finds a, add this too?
3/18/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: hmm, I guess that would work better'
3/18/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but do we have to augment the tree then?
3/18/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hmm dont think so?
3/18/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But the algorithm must be altered a little bit
3/18/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Because it must also add every node it encounters on the way to a and b right?
3/18/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Except when you turn right xD
3/18/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Fuck this shit lol
3/18/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: only if that node lies between a and b
3/18/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: or left depending on wether you are going to a - b *
3/18/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: hence having an order could help with that
3/18/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yes, but when going towards a, everything you encounter when turning left is bewteen a and bw
3/18/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Where are these orders explained again, cant really remember what you mean
3/18/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: presentation 8, slide 21
3/18/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks
3/18/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
3/18/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: firstly vertical line through the median on the x points, then horizontal line in the two boxes through the median on the y points of the remaining coordinates
3/18/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: if I have 8 points on the x axis, what would be taken as the median then? the 4th or the 5th one?
3/18/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: also, if I cut it in half each time, do I take the one I cut on(for instance 5) into account when doing the next cut for horizontal/vertical?
3/18/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The 4th probably, they said in the lecture about selection median means lower median
3/18/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: then for the quiz question, why do they pick 6 to be the median of the right side?
3/18/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It is a range tree, not a kd tree, range tree only splits on x coordinate
3/18/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: okay, thanks! that clears it up
3/18/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I did it without an order, did you manage to do it with one ?
3/18/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: no, getting stuck on  that. I think without should work fine
3/18/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: did you just modify idrangequery?
3/18/17, 15:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys why cant i watch videocollegue anymore
3/18/17, 15:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ask for shitty silverlight
3/18/17, 15:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Doesnt work on edge doesnt work on firefox
3/18/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Jep, it's basically exactly the same, just modify the adding
3/18/17, 15:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Doesnt work anywhere
3/18/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: doesnt work in firefox chrome or edge
3/18/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: <Media omitted>
3/18/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: would this be correct for 3?
3/18/17, 15:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: anyone to answer my question
3/18/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: In the code x=x.p does that mean that x takes the key of its parent or we just denote the parent of x by x ?
3/18/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: We set the pointer x to the parent of the node x currently points to
3/18/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ahhh ok then
3/18/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Thank you
3/18/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys, anyone have any idea what to do at 7a?
3/18/17, 15:28 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: drink bleach -> ??? -> profit
3/18/17, 15:28 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Skipping step two and three is fine too
3/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: For the first part of 7a, assume that left[x].max >= I.e.  All intervals there have a lower bound smaller than x.s, so also smaller than I.s. At least one interval in the left subtree also has an upper bound >=I.e.
3/18/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'll go with option A: drink bleach
3/18/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: how would you show that the augmentation theorem holds? do I need to prove it like you do with loop invarients and such, as they did in the slides for OS-select?
3/18/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ah, good to have you back
3/18/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: same
3/18/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you just augment the rb tree with size of subtree right?
3/18/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: if so you can refer to the previously proven augmentation theorem (slide 38 presentation 8) and show that size[x] only depends on x, right, and left subtree of x
3/18/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I know what you do, but is the proving method the same for every augmentation?
3/18/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: basically
3/18/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: they say you don't have to show the algoritm
3/18/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: so it should be sufficient to refer to the theory
3/18/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: okay, thanks
3/18/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: if we prove with a counter example in A5 5 of DS: do we also need to give the different running time, or only say it's different from O(log(n))?
3/18/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Well, you have to prove that it's not O(log n). So the easiest way to do that is to show that it's something O(n ) instead. I'm not sure how else you could prove that it's not log n
3/18/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Anyone knows at 7a what you need to know to make a similar claim about the right subtree? Cant think of anything
3/18/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: If all the intervals in the right subtree still have a lower starting point than I.s, then you can basicaaly say the same as for the left subtree
3/18/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: What is meant with the square or round field in 5c of A5? as in, how do I use that in proving it holds or doesn't hold for the sum of keys of square, as they don't say when something is square or round
3/18/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Thnx hugo
3/18/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Idk, I just assumed that there is some function isSquare(x) to see if it is square or round
3/18/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Yoy only have to look at in which nodes the information f should be changed at most when inserting or deleting a node
3/18/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Doesnt really matter in which cases there they are square or rounded
3/18/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but how do you know when it will change, if you don't know where the square or rounds will be inputted?
3/18/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But that doesn't really matter, though, you just have to show that you can calculate the sumOfSquareKeys of a node given that node and it's children
3/18/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: And then the augmentation theorem says you can do insertions/deletions in log(n) time
3/18/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 👆🏻
3/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Where do you find the 'rooster' on osiris?
3/19/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: they made another website for that: mytimetable.tue.nl
3/19/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 😅😢
3/19/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How fucking stupid are they
3/19/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Is There a link for that on mytue?
3/19/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes
3/19/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "persoonlijk rooster"
3/19/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Osiris only hosts the grades btw
3/19/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No things like schedules
3/19/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yeah and course subscriptions
3/19/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: any one else not registered for the data structures in osiris?
3/19/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: the exam*
3/19/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lemme take a look
3/19/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
3/19/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: should we email them? or just complain afterwards
3/19/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Me neither
3/19/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Should we have the examination dates in persoonlijk rooster? I only have the one from modeling
3/19/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: same here
3/19/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 20th right?
3/19/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: DS is the 10th
3/19/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Well this is gonna be easy😂
3/19/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: zou ik maar ff afkloppen als ik jou was 😜
3/19/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
3/19/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is anyone mailing about this already?
3/19/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Else I will
3/19/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should we ask this to Speckman or Arthur?
3/19/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: hmm, I think you should email the stu or whatever because we were registered in oase
3/19/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: so it must have been their fault
3/19/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: might cc arthur
3/19/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will do, are you sure we were registered in OASE first?
3/19/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait a second
3/19/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I see I'm also not registered for physics resit anymore
3/19/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What the..
3/19/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
3/19/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Osiris only shows modeling
3/19/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes, because I know the date of the exam: 10 april
3/19/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What is that STU email?
3/19/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: stu@tue.nl?
3/19/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: go.fuckyourself@tue.nl ?
3/19/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: lol
3/19/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: I have mine still in my calendar at canvas
3/19/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: studadm.win@tue.nl is the email for your resit, so probably for other exams too
3/19/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh cool, will take that one then
3/19/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks!
3/19/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Might also want to cc osiris@tue.nl because that's the osiris helpdesk
3/19/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Guys, is question 2 of the DS quiz 'none of the above'?
3/19/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes
3/19/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: by the third law of multiple choice:
3/19/17, 11:58 - Bas Gieling: i think so yeah
3/19/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: If there is an "none of the above" or "all of the above" the correct answer shall be these.
3/19/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hahahahaha you are right tho
3/19/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
3/19/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or just the longest answer
3/19/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: or that one answer that has the underlining at the wrong place _hint hint_
3/19/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wait what :p
3/19/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Anyone have any clue for DS ex 6 yet?
3/19/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: augmented RB tree is as far as i got
3/19/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: What did you augment it with then
3/19/17, 12:05 - Bas Gieling: yea she said during one of the lectures that we would only ever have to augment RB-trees, so its definitely an RB-tree
3/19/17, 12:06 - Bas Gieling: (i think)
3/19/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yep, I did it without an augmented RB-tree
3/19/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And I think it is correct, hopefully
3/19/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: It was a bitch to prove correct tho, pretty long
3/19/17, 12:07 - Bas Gieling: with or without an RB tree?
3/19/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: With an RB tree
3/19/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Else you cant have O(log(n)) insert and Subthing
3/19/17, 12:08 - Bas Gieling: yea alright
3/19/17, 12:08 - Bas Gieling: you said without there so i got confused xD
3/19/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: yeah Im sorry lol, wasnt clear
3/19/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: With the augmented RB tree you can easily motivate the runtime of insert, so that helps
3/19/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I emailed osiris and stu about the deregistered datastructures exam
3/19/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: You can with an regular RB-tree also, right?
3/19/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but then what do you augment it with?
3/19/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I mean, it is given that Insert can be done in O(log(n)) in a RB-tree
3/19/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I guess you can add the size of the subtree rooted at each node and apply order statistics somehow
3/19/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I use the sum of the keys in the subtree
3/19/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: hmm, was thinking of something like that as well
3/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I just say in pseudocode: 'add all keys in the right subtree'
3/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Which is basically the same
3/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And this add all keys, should be able in O(#keys) time
3/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Which comes down to at most O(b-a)
3/19/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: But that still might take too much time
3/19/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Why ?
3/19/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If you add the left subtree of the root, if a is the minimum in the tree, then it takes something like n/2 = O(n ) time
3/19/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: anne is right to my knowledge
3/19/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hmmm
3/19/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You can safely assume Anne is always right
3/19/17, 12:15 - Bas Gieling: ^
3/19/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: it could work tom, but you have to read the excersize a bit better
3/19/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: there is a catch
3/19/17, 12:15 - Bas Gieling: there is a viper under the grass
3/19/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But b-a is never dependend on n right, so the runtime would be O(2*(b-a)log(n))
3/19/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Which is O(log(n)), or am I being dumb?
3/19/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: very helpful if you see it, impossible to do the ex without it
3/19/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: b-a is just a difference between numbers, not between ranks of keys, so this can be a lot larger than n
3/19/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I can do this in O(1)
3/19/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah true
3/19/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But I just wanted to be right, cuz now I hae to change my proof
3/19/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: :(
3/19/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: xD
3/19/17, 12:17 - Bas Gieling: feelsbad
3/19/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: You are completely right tho, Imma change it
3/19/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: no srsly tom
3/19/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I can
3/19/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: With the extra attribute?
3/19/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You can alter the datastructure
3/19/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yes
3/19/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, it doesnt change my psudocode at all
3/19/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: so just add the sum of the nodes in the subtree to a node
3/19/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Just the 'add all keys' changes to 'add the augmented value'
3/19/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah
3/19/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But my proof of correctness tho
3/19/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: That will be great
3/19/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: easy
3/19/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That works very well
3/19/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: setup is not calcuated into running time
3/19/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: seeing as setup in and of itself is O1 in the larger scheme of things
3/19/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks guys:)
3/19/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Np complete
3/19/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: In A5 Q7b, are the conditions for guaranteeing an overlapping interval supposed to be a condition on the intervals in T?
3/19/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is it true that we have an information meeting on choosing electives on wednesday?
3/19/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would like to know this as well, although I already chose mine by luck of the draw :p
3/19/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Electives for Q4 or Y2?
3/19/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Q4
3/19/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'd say
3/19/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or maybe even Y2
3/19/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No Y2
3/19/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because you need to chose all of those already
3/19/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Seriously?
3/19/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Before when
3/19/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
3/19/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: TLDR
3/19/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: May 19th is deadline of registration according to presentation on Canvas
3/19/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thank you :p
3/19/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 30964348‬: For the quiz of DS. Is question 3 the tree with 6 as root and 4,1,7,5 as the leaves the correct answer?
3/19/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: ↑ You might want to use this hint
3/19/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ooh was that for the quiz :p
3/19/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 30964348‬: ty
3/19/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Anyone has a hint for 7a?
3/19/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Split the proof in the if part and the only if part, then use the definition of completely covering and the definition of x.left.max and the assumptions you make to get some inequalities.
3/19/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thats what we thought but you get a sort of while loop
3/19/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Aka a algoritm
3/19/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: A hint for 7b would be great too
3/19/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I must agree with Thomas
3/19/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Who is algebro?
3/19/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Was wondering this too
3/19/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 😂

3/19/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Here I have disproven 7a
3/19/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But I have to prove it, what do?
3/19/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: De-disprove it
3/19/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 😜
3/19/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: you haven't disproven anything man
3/19/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: re-read the assignment
3/19/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Guys, completely unrelated question, but if you are registered for the resit of a course you've passed, do you need to de-register for it or does it not matter?
3/19/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: doesn't matter
3/19/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I did thrice
3/19/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight good
3/19/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: leftxmax returns 5 in my example which is not higher or equal to 9
3/19/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: left[x].max ≥ I.e.
3/19/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: so maximum of [5...10]
3/19/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Leftmax returns the highest node value in the subtree
3/19/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Atleast that's what I have learned
3/19/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: <Media omitted>
3/19/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: goddamn that's retarded
3/19/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: well thanks
3/19/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I hope we get universal naming schemes one dat
3/19/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: day
3/19/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys when does our holiday start?
3/19/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: zomer?
3/19/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 10 juli vgm
3/19/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
3/19/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (It wasn't that smart to share it in this group)
3/19/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: (you might be right)
3/19/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But a and b are numbers right? So how can you compare them to nodes?
3/19/17, 17:41 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: i don't think the algo is entirely correct
3/19/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: It's too short
3/19/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: o
3/19/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: speckmann only wants long ones
3/19/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 🤣
3/19/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: Leon does your algorithm assume that a and b are values in the set S?
3/19/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: because thats what it seems like to me
3/19/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: and I don't know if we can do that
3/19/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: your algorithm doesnt run in O(log n) does it?
3/19/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: there is a problem with my a and b since theyre meant to be 2 values however i put them there as if they were the nodes with as their key values a and b
3/19/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: i think it does run in log n tho, since in the worst case it needs to travel from 2 leaves all the way to the root
3/19/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: and since its a RB tree that will take log n time i think
3/19/17, 19:38 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but then how does it add all the leaves in between
3/19/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: leaves are only at the bottom
3/19/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: so what exactly do you mean
3/19/17, 20:03 - Bas Gieling: nodes
3/19/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Send nodes
3/19/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Are we supposed to build the tree or we just assume S is a valid redblack tree
3/19/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: <Media omitted>
3/19/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: No, because sum is not a valid action. It could be a valid action if you augmented your data structure, but then every node has information stored in sum, and it still wouldn't work the way you wrote it
3/19/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Like you could store the sum of all nodes in the subtree rooted at v in sum[v]
3/19/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: ypu cant use range queries anyway, because they arent dynamic data structures. inserting can't happen in log(n) while keeping a logarithmic height of your tree
3/19/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: ouu*
3/19/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: you***
3/19/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: But the way you wrote it is pseudocode at best
3/19/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And then your pseudocode is literally your whole algorithm without explanation in one sentence
3/19/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: Jup thought so. Thanks for the explanation ^^
3/19/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guys, for question 6, has anyone succesfully proved his/her correctness?
3/19/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: nope not yet
3/19/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: it is quite hard
3/19/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 42082100‬ left
3/19/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Doeeeeeeg
3/19/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: beter
3/19/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: dun dun dun, and another one bites the dust
3/19/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Je was geliefd
3/19/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: who was that
3/19/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you were not in my contacts
3/19/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: casual
3/19/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: @420
3/19/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: Jens Versteegen.vcf (file attached)
3/19/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: Can we add him?
3/19/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Depends
3/19/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No
3/19/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is he worthy
3/19/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I think I know him
3/19/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: If have a pic of him wearing a bra
3/19/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: @31642007885
3/19/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: I think the fact that he plays osrs makes him pretty worthy
3/19/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: vote
3/19/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: i vote carrot
3/19/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: @31642007885  stop this democracy before we become like Turkey's democracy
3/19/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: what does the min and comma do in this runtime? O(min(n,(k+ 1) logn))
3/19/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: like how should i even read this
3/19/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: has a running time of (k+1)log n, but will never take more than linear tie
3/19/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: time*
3/19/17, 21:36 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: min(x,y) is the minimum of x and y
3/19/17, 21:36 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: oh alright
3/19/17, 21:36 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: thanks
3/19/17, 22:06 - ‪+351 935 579 164‬: Does anyone know the last answer for the quiz?
3/19/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes
3/19/17, 22:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The person who made it
3/19/17, 22:07 - ‪+351 935 579 164‬: does someone else in this group chat know it? or is that person here?
3/19/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬ added ‪+31 6 57985842‬
3/19/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Guys here's a link to the this group https://chat.whatsapp.com/KCf5MHiKnFD2A3SKBcqF3c
3/19/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 👆🏻
3/19/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 11191755‬: the tree in the assignment has for each node another tree with the associated y values, so the question is replace all of the (x)-values in the subtree with root n with their y values and make that into a correct tree
3/19/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 11191755‬: ssshhh
3/19/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: does anyone know what the min means in the running time of 7b
3/19/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: min = minimum 👌🏻
3/19/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: i get that
3/19/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: haha
3/19/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but what does it mean in this case
3/19/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: it means that it will have a (k+1)log n running time, but will never take longer than linear
3/19/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ah thanks
3/19/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: basically (hint hint) it will never do a constant time operation multiple times on a node
3/19/17, 22:27 - ‪+351 935 579 164‬: <Media omitted>
3/19/17, 22:27 - ‪+351 935 579 164‬: so you mean this one?

3/19/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: That is not a correct tree
3/19/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: 1 can't be to the right of 5
3/19/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Make sure to keep the standard binary search tree rules in mind
3/19/17, 22:31 - ‪+351 935 579 164‬: <Media omitted>
3/19/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, that alignment is wrong
3/19/17, 22:32 - ‪+351 935 579 164‬: which one?
3/19/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, look at the line under the question
3/19/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: 1 4 5 7
3/19/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: In the last one, the alignment is off
3/19/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You got it, Rick is going on about his hint
3/19/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Where do you register for the courses of Q4 on mytue?
3/19/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: osiris
3/19/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I know, but can't find it on Osiris

3/20/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You were assigned For data structures assignment
3/20/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But you need that right?
3/20/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Final***
3/20/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: But they didn't change it for everyone, so I guess we have to spam their inbox with emails
3/20/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Nahh I guess they only display when you can participate in the exam
3/20/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Remember we first need a 5 for the assigments
3/20/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: And I guess they still have to calculate who can join
3/20/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Is the professor who is responsible for the course also responsible for registering students for the final test?
3/20/17, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Dont know if the professor is responsible, but i know the students arent responsible
3/20/17, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: But we already have enough points
3/20/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck off
3/20/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think someone mentioned that, not entirely sure though
3/20/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: They are not gonna update it constantly if someone has reached the sufficient amount of points
3/20/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This exactly haha
3/20/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Help

3/20/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: wth?
3/20/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Of course!

3/20/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: like i see "undirected graph" in that thing and don't even know what it even is
3/20/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: A lot of nodes with edges, not in a tree structure and without arrows
3/20/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Just use Dijkstra
3/20/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Tried that yesterday
3/20/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But it wasn't online before 9 today right?
3/20/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I don't care, still tried

3/21/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Do you have to put the display shit at the top as well?
3/21/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For the pp2
3/21/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because currently our display code is randomly putting on 3 outputs
3/21/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 50988766‬: Yes
3/21/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You mean the hex7seg?
3/21/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Then yes
3/21/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I fucking hate this processor
3/21/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: With passion
3/21/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lol
3/21/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep
3/21/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Why won't they give us a decent processor
3/21/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Give me an arduino
3/21/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And a raspberry
3/21/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: I think arduino is cheaper than this
3/21/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll give you a perfectly working sorter with a nice web interface
3/21/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Not sure tho
3/21/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That you can control via web
3/21/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You can get an arduino for 3 euro's
3/21/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: That's what I said: Since arduino is only €3, it's way cheaper than this crappy PP2
3/21/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: look
3/21/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: no
3/21/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ahh wait I misintrepreted that
3/21/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I thought you ment it like: I think arduino's are cheaper than the pp2 right?
3/21/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: It's also pretty annoying when something works perfectly on the emulator, but it doesn't work no the PP2
3/21/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah our is now just randomly putting 3 outputs on, one of which we never even set and displaying a stripe
3/21/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Really fucking weird
3/21/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Like the last 3 outputs
3/21/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Has anyone had that problem?
3/21/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If we remove the OUTPUT (relative position of power outputs) it doesn't turn them on..
3/21/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: While we've mentioned ouput nowhere in our program
3/21/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just in the data segment
3/21/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
3/21/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: BRS instead of BRA*
3/21/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: A few lines below where the two BRS's are together it makes the same jump and there it does it correctly
3/21/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And the BRA below the yellow line isn't in my code
3/21/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: The pp2 debugger is bugged. What you are seeing here is a previous version of your code. In order to see the changes actually on the screen, you need to restart the program
3/21/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Have done that a couple of times already ;/
3/21/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it's a display bug
3/21/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: if you go to the hex-file it's not there
3/21/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it doesn't do anything-code wise apart from confusing you
3/21/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I just re-downloaded both the assembler and the debugger and now it seems to work
3/21/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: After recompiling though
3/21/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: where can i find data str past exams

3/21/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: got a question about the assembly data words if someone can help me: https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/questions/14287372
3/21/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Could someone test our code and see if it crashes your pp2 too? Or maybe take a look at it, we're trying to display words but for some reason when enabling the routine that puts the letters on the display in the timer_interrupt routine the program won't pause. If you press pause it crashes, it does display the words though
3/21/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And we've tried almost everything we can come up with but have no idea
3/21/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is it true that you cannot update the displays in the timer interrupt routine?
3/21/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because that seems to be our problem
3/21/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'm planning to do that using a brs to a subroutine that edits them
3/21/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and they work on the emulator
3/21/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: havent tested them on the actual pp2 yet
3/21/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It works on the emu yes
3/21/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But on the pp2 it crashes
3/21/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: We had some problems that if the motor and the sensor were in the same output group, it would crash.
3/21/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: The sensor in an _output_ group?
3/21/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: The pp2 can output 1.1 A on one group (it has two groups) and a mother can use 0.6 A so you can't turn 2 motors on at the same time
3/21/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Motor*
3/21/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: If you use more than 1.1 A the fed light will turn on
3/21/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Yeah indeed, I was mistaken. It were two motors!
3/21/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: Anyone know what to do when the program doesnt show up in the debugger?
3/21/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: reconnect and restart the processor and the debugger
3/21/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: Did that
3/21/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: then it might not be an hex file?
3/21/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: No it worked before
3/21/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: Fuck this shit
3/21/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Our processor all of the sudden diceded not to connect anymore, so we tried an hour to make it work and gave up for today in the end
3/21/17, 18:04 - Luke Houben: Make sure the 3 switches on the right side of the pp2 are up and that no input is 1 when you connect it
3/21/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: And first connect the pp2 to the computer and power and start after that the debugger program
3/21/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Can we organize a sacrificial offering for the pp2 processors after we're done with them? To please the TU/e gods and end the miserable lifes of the poor processors. Like throw them into a fire or something
3/21/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lives*
3/21/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But Yeah
3/21/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sounds like a pretty Good idea
3/21/17, 20:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: DS grades are online

3/21/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That's what I'm wondering too...
3/21/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: Wait what
3/21/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Interval search searches for an interval that overlaps
3/21/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Not fully overlaps but a little bit enough
3/21/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: I also failed this question
3/21/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah but following the algo from the slides you'd never find 17,23
3/21/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: owh wait
3/21/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: this is weird
3/21/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: I would say 11,22
3/21/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 57985842‬: yeah following their algorithm i got 11,22
3/21/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes me too
3/21/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: me three
3/21/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: me four
3/21/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: me 4.5
3/21/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: my tutor even told me it was answer e
3/21/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: wtf
3/21/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Me five
3/21/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well hearing that they've prolly made a mistake
3/21/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll email arthus
3/21/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: me six
3/21/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: arthur even
3/21/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I got it correct 👌🏿
3/21/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Han snapt er geen bal van en heeft het goed
3/21/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: sjonge jonge
3/21/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: 😔
3/21/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Did you guess Han or did you follow an algorithm?
3/21/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I followed the algorithm in the slides
3/21/17, 20:44 - Luke Houben: I did as well but 22 > 21 so x = left[x] in my world
3/21/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah
3/21/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I just emailed arthur about it
3/21/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Let's see what his response is
3/21/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Can you send me a screenshot of the slide, it wont open on my phone
3/21/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: sec
3/21/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Nvm it opens now
3/21/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
3/21/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
3/21/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And here are my amazing paint skills that I used to explain it to John
3/21/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I don't know what I did then haha
3/21/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: do we have an exam for USE basics?
3/21/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
3/21/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Mentor said easypeasy
3/21/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just read the book and win
3/21/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: how do i register for my courses via osiris?
3/21/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: pretty straightforward
3/21/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Look up the course and press register
3/21/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: how do i look up a course
3/21/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i fucking hate this wtf is this osiris bullshit
3/21/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: In the planapp
3/21/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
3/21/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I identify as quartile JAAR
3/21/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: wtf is that
3/21/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: what subjects do i register for
3/21/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: me looking for subjects and wanting to select a quartile between GS-I and JAAR
3/21/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: all subjects
3/21/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Wait are you not in quartile X now?
3/21/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I can select which quartile (mostly), but I can't select the study year. Oase could do this, so why remove it???
3/21/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You have to type in the subject code in osiris to sign up
3/21/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Automata is 2IT70
3/21/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: When is the physics resit?
3/21/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
3/21/17, 21:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah when is physics exactly
3/21/17, 21:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Physics is 12th of april
3/21/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I found this, which could be handy, https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/
3/21/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oehh it's all nice and wobbly
3/21/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I like it
3/21/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ikr:)
3/21/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I added it to the handy links section over @ cs-students.nl
3/21/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks :)
3/21/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: congratulations, I was one step ahead of you
3/21/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Any way to check your quiz in DS? To see what you did wrong?
3/21/17, 22:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes
3/21/17, 22:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: open it agani
3/21/17, 22:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: again*
3/21/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: People have also been uploading their nearly perfect and tutor commented assigments to cs-students.nl so you can check against thsoe
3/21/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: those*
3/21/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And use them for the exam ofcoarse
3/21/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: The assignments are pretty good as well :D, just lost my first point in a quiz though and just want to know wtf went wrong
3/21/17, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Thanks for letting me know though
3/21/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Everybody did
3/21/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: <Media omitted>
3/21/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And that's the reason
3/21/17, 23:24 - Bas Gieling: i was pretty sure it should return [11,22]
3/21/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I've emailed Arthur about it already
3/21/17, 23:24 - Bas Gieling: so im not the only one?
3/21/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: nope
3/21/17, 23:25 - Bas Gieling: o right i just read back the conversation, sorry
3/21/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
3/21/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I just selected that because @31643470096  said everyone said that was the answer
3/21/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Keep us posted!
3/21/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Algo always checks left one first
3/21/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Atleast thats what i thought
3/21/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: So i also had that one wrong :s
3/21/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I think everyone but @31625164039 got it wrong
3/21/17, 23:57 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: I had 17,23 too am i stupid now
3/21/17, 23:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: No
3/21/17, 23:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: You've always been stupid
3/21/17, 23:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 😝
3/21/17, 23:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm not calling anyone stupid😢
3/21/17, 23:58 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: 4D chess, jort
3/22/17, 00:00 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 36D reverse monopoly
3/22/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: So for DS grades, how does it work? You need to have 50 points for your best 5 weeks, right?
3/22/17, 00:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes
3/22/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And if you get more than 60 you have quite a high possible to pass rate so to say
3/22/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: More than 60 in those 5 assignments of more than 60 over all assigments?
3/22/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: More than 60 in those 5
3/22/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: <Media omitted>
3/22/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I'm safe right ?
3/22/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes and you've got 1 extra assigment
3/22/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Nice
3/22/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Are you safe ?
3/22/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I'm currently near 80
3/22/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Nice
3/22/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I wonder if this year its also 50% that doesnt make it
3/22/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Seems like most people have 50 points
3/22/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I think it was => 50 to pass
3/22/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Or to be able to take the exam*
3/22/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah
3/22/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But 50% were able to previous year
3/22/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ohh in that way
3/22/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I have the feeling that a lot more people are able to this year
3/22/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I only know 1 person who won't be
3/22/17, 00:24 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Hi
3/22/17, 00:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: LOL
3/22/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Guys don't forget to check the rubric of A5
3/22/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: They forgot to fill in q5 by ours
3/22/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: whelp
3/22/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: jup same, but im not there, so how can i fix it?
3/22/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Magical thing called email :p
3/22/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: haha alright but to who? tutor or some teacher
3/22/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: uuh, I'd say start with the one responsible
3/22/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So your tutor
3/22/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Anyone Who chose computer graphics that wants to share their experience? Im considering talking the subject in my 2nd year
3/22/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: @31621372984
3/22/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I thought it to be a very interesting topic with lots of applications, but did not really think the lectures were very well structured or "inspirational". As the mathematics can be quite hard, this can make it hard to stay up to date and motivated. I found at least haha...
3/22/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: It's a lot of fucking fun
3/22/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it's hard though
3/22/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: really hard
3/22/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Thanks that was helpful Cas
3/22/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Is it really as hard as they said?
3/22/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: imo it is
3/22/17, 13:53 - Kevin Jilissen: And the content of the course is a little "outdated", still interesting and fun though
3/22/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Thats why i didnt take it this year
3/22/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I Just really wanna do AI
3/22/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: But for some reason its in A package with cg
3/22/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I think it's fun, however the structure of the course was terrible
3/22/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I'm asking myself this as well
3/22/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: How many formulas do you guys have for modeling?
3/22/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Maybe theyll improve it next year
3/22/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the lectures were shit, you have to do everything by yourself
3/22/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but fuck it was fun
3/22/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Hahaha 👆🏻
3/22/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Okay thanks!
3/22/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Basically quality wise the course sucks but content wise is really fun
3/22/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ^
3/22/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the mathmatics are hard
3/22/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but the actual designing in GLSL and openGL was so much fun
3/22/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the robotrace assignment i had a lot of fun with
3/22/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: And the biggest issue I had with the course was that they hardly provided any practice exercises and just gave you a vague context description and let you work on the assignment
3/22/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yea thats true
3/22/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the exercises we did have were fuckin hard too
3/22/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i didnt pass, along with the majority of first year students who took the course i think
3/22/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: ^
3/22/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lemme check, one moment
3/22/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you mean derivations im guessing?
3/22/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yh
3/22/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i mean, just make as many as you need to get to what you need to have
3/22/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: our model works with the derivations we have
3/22/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and we got an answer using our model
3/22/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so i mean
3/22/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i dont think you should look at other, since your problem definition and model will be different
3/22/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyway, we have 7
3/22/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: we have 53 and got an 8.5
3/22/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You have 53 derivations?!
3/22/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 53?
3/22/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: daan do u calculate the amount of grass next to the toll gates and the amount of water droplets in the sea?
3/22/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what the actual fuck
3/22/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we have 7 and got a 7.4 so fuck you
3/22/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and our model works
3/22/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we've made it with the 7 derivations
3/22/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so yea
3/22/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its enough if it works right
3/22/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: she even said they were very good
3/22/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: why is the check your match day at the same time as the data structures recap lecture?
3/22/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: because the TUE cant plan shit properly
3/23/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Thanks voor het meerijden Thorn, dat had ik wel nodig 😅
3/23/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Guys would prim algo give a MST of total weight infinity or just one MSTand lots of nodes ?
3/23/17, 09:40 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Wrong chat 😂😂😂
3/23/17, 09:40 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Robin was lammetje
3/23/17, 09:42 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Studentikoos drinken, +d
3/23/17, 09:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: +d I like that
3/23/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Whoopsie 😅
3/23/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys if the debugger shows cons .... is there a way to figure out what that means?
3/23/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because there should be a cmp 1000 on that line
3/23/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And our code gets stuck there for some reason
3/23/17, 10:14 - Luke Houben: @31643222030 You have really a lot of problems with your PP2
3/23/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah
3/23/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I've just redownloaded the assembler and debugger
3/23/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But I did that like 3 times already
3/23/17, 10:16 - Luke Houben: CONS is only used in that Hex7Seg table thingy
3/23/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah and since we've added our hextable we're having these problems
3/23/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: All our hex thingies show up as BRA in the debugger
3/23/17, 10:17 - Luke Houben: Are you skipping the hex table in the start of your program
3/23/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes
3/23/17, 10:17 - Luke Houben: so like main: BRA start
hex thingies
start: do shit
3/23/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We've got it as following:

BRA start
timer_interrupt
hex thingies
Start
3/23/17, 10:17 - Luke Houben: Does the timer interrupt have a RTI?
3/23/17, 10:18 - Luke Houben: Or whatever is needed to go out of a interrupt
3/23/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: RTS
3/23/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: RTE
3/23/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's been working fine untill we added all this shit
3/23/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: for the display
3/23/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which isn't even called yet
3/23/17, 10:20 - Luke Houben: For some reason it is going through them and i think it has something to do with the timer_interrupt above it
3/23/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Switched them out and we've got the same problem
3/23/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: When are the finals of q3?
3/23/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys?
3/23/17, 10:37 - Luke Houben: April 10th - April 21st
3/23/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: 10 april data struggles
3/23/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Thanks
3/23/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 12 april physics resit
3/23/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 10 april also modeling report deadline I guess
3/23/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: the second week is modeling final
3/23/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Are you allowed to model for modeling using something else rather than using accel?
3/23/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Cuz I think quite a lot of groups are doing this, but our tutor just emailed us that this wasnt allowed
3/23/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So I'm congusedb
3/23/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Confused*
3/23/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Ask your tutor
3/23/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is it tutor dependent ?:/
3/23/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Fuck this we have to do everything over then😑
3/23/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
3/23/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Ask your tutor why he/she doesn't allow it
3/23/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: It's about what the professor allows
3/23/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Maybe it's a stupid reason and theb you can just keep workung with what you have
3/23/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: *then, working
3/23/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Someone who can give me a hint on how to do exercise 7 of DS?
3/23/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wow I haven't even completed the Quiz yet :o
3/23/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
3/23/17, 19:05 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: A path consists of edges right
3/23/17, 19:05 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: those edges have weights
3/23/17, 19:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: a minimax path is the path where the maximum weight of an edge is as small as possible
3/23/17, 19:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: <Media omitted>
3/23/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: for example, the red lines here is the minimax path from F to M
3/23/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: since the maximum weight of an edge there is 9
3/23/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: and that path is the path where the maximum weight of an edge is as small as possible
3/23/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: allright i understand that, however the word maximum in there still confuses me
3/23/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: i mean in the picture i would describe it as taking the edges with minimal weight
3/23/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: yeah it is quite a confusing term
3/23/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: jup, thanks man
3/23/17, 22:48 - Casper Smits: Can anyone tell me if it is possible to retrieve the length of a linked list (in a Adjacency list) in constant time?
3/23/17, 22:48 - Casper Smits: Or, if that is not possible, how does define in pseudo code how to "loop" over all elements in the linked list?
3/23/17, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Not 100% sure but I thought that the length was maintained inside a variable of the linked list
3/23/17, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: So it would just be returning that variable which is constant
3/23/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Probably just like you do with attributes of an array, as described on page 21 of the booj
3/23/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: *book
3/24/17, 03:24 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: I can't do the modelling test
3/24/17, 03:25 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: The deadline was Friday midnight right?
3/24/17, 03:25 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Apparently they made a mistake
3/24/17, 03:25 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: <Media omitted>
3/24/17, 03:29 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: I'm pretty sure the deadline always have been 11:55 PM right?
3/24/17, 07:48 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: No it was always till midnight
3/24/17, 07:53 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: That is definitely a mistake
3/24/17, 07:54 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I made several tests on Friday and that was always before the deadline
3/24/17, 07:57 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: yeah it was always friday 23:55
3/24/17, 08:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Isn't that if you do them in the according week?
3/24/17, 08:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since they give you a week extra for each
3/24/17, 08:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice 3:25
3/24/17, 08:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Best time to do modeling
3/24/17, 08:10 - ‪+31 6 40200108‬: Test 5

Available from Sunday March 12, 18.45 until Friday March  24, 23:59
3/24/17, 08:11 - ‪+31 6 40200108‬: So yeah they fucked up the time
3/24/17, 08:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm going to send a very angry e-mail to Gaben
3/24/17, 08:17 - ‪+31 6 40200108‬: Haha
3/24/17, 08:19 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Emiel working with valve time
3/24/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not trying to be a nazi in this case though because they fucked up, but take this as solid advice for every bit of your studies: do not wait for deadlines to show up before you start working. You'll lose an argument when shit breaks down since you've had two weeks to make 8 math exercises and only tried to start the last day.
3/24/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Better make sure you're safe than that you depend on working internet or them not fucking up
3/24/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Everything can always go wrong
3/24/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Murphy's law
3/24/17, 08:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I've already done the math test for next week, you proud ma?
3/24/17, 08:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nee
3/24/17, 08:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Kk op max

3/24/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: wow
3/24/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes, that's the way you're gonna win this shit
3/24/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: has someone sent an email about the math test
3/24/17, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: BESTUUUUUR, ER WORDT GESPAMD OVER DAT ER GESPAMD WORDT!
3/24/17, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: </spam>
3/24/17, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Guys stop spamming
3/24/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: guys when subscribing for your courses, i already subscribed for automata and my elective, but what about the use?
3/24/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It's a basic course, so you need to register for that one too
3/24/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: yes but how?
3/24/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Osiris
3/24/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: what is the code or anything
3/24/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Same way as both others
3/24/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: whats the course code?
3/24/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just click "propedeuse SfS" in the inschrijf men
3/24/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Menu
3/24/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It pops up for yoy
3/24/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You
3/24/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 0seb0 or something
3/24/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: 0sab0
3/24/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Only your elective doesn't pop up in the preset propedeuse tap
3/24/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Tab
3/24/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Uvuvwevwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwemuhwem 0SAB0
3/24/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: there are two use ones does it matter which one i choose?
3/24/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes
3/24/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No
3/24/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They both state exactly the same schedule and timeslots
3/24/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: what about analyse2?
3/24/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The fuck is that
3/24/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: it was there for me too but most people said it wasnt important
3/24/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: i still dont know why its there though
3/24/17, 10:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What is analyse2 except some higher level course :p
3/24/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They probably want to share the fun of analysis with other majors
3/24/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Follow up of analysis 1
3/24/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 100/147 people failed that course this year
3/24/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: It is a course that even anne barely passed
3/24/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: so just ignore it?
3/24/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: but why would they give it, our block is full already with other subjects
3/24/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: yes, taking it as an elective might not be a good idea.
3/24/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Analyse is never a good idea
3/24/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: it's a 1st year mathematics course, so they probably made a mistake putting it in the list of your subjects or something and now people can get confused
3/24/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
3/24/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: How do you have 4 subject?
3/24/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Subjects*
3/24/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: i have those except statistical data analysis
3/24/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, HTI is a very easy subject, so if I got 30 or 35 ECTS I am gonna pick that one, if I got 40 ECTS I am gonna pick SDA
3/24/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You can always deregister from a course
3/24/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Lol
3/24/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Then you are alright
3/24/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Haha good idea
3/24/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Taking analyse 2 as an elective is the same as throwing 5 studypoint in a well
3/24/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is fucking smart
3/24/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Emiel van Berkum responded to the email I sent him; math test 5 is available again.
3/24/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooh then you can just wait until tonight 22:00 :)
3/24/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Lol sign up for every elective possible every time
3/24/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You can deregister anyway
3/24/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Thats the idea, yeah
3/24/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys what can cause the red light to go on on the pp2 group?
3/24/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Like one of the lights
3/24/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Our machine works fine but when returning from error for some reason the red light for the second set of outputs goes on
3/24/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: multiple outputs running
3/24/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i believe
3/24/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hmmm
3/24/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But I've only got 1 motor and 2 lights connected there ;/
3/24/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And am now turning them off before moving on so that's not the problem
3/24/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: rubain
3/24/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: when does it happen
3/24/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ik smijt die tyfes pp2 het raam uit
3/24/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hahaha
3/24/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nee for real
3/24/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: want rood lampje is overload gwn
3/24/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: maar
3/24/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: RUBEN MAAT FOR REAL
3/24/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: wanneer gebeurt het
3/24/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: HEB JE AL GEPROBEERD MET UPPAAL TE WERKEN
3/24/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 1000x ERGER TRUST ME
3/24/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: IK WORD ECHT GEK HIER
3/24/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ^ Florian can confirm
3/24/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: KILL ME
3/24/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Nee dat gaat luke doen
3/24/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ok hij draait dus helemaal goed, vervolgens trek ik een input eruit en komt er een error. Die fix ik weer en ik druk weer op de start knop en dan begint het programma gewoon opnieuw en dan looptie ineens vast
3/24/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Maar hij gaat weer naar de routine waar hij normaal ook start
3/24/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Op eenzelfde wijze als dat dat gebeurt als je gewoon die startknop indrukt met alle inputs erin
3/24/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: dan krijg je dat overload lampje dus?
3/24/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes
3/24/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: dat
3/24/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: is echt
3/24/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: kenker vaag
3/24/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ja
3/24/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ik snap der ook geen flikker meer van
3/24/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: als ie naar de zelfde state terug springt als dat hij normaal start
3/24/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: dan weet ik het ook niet
3/24/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Weet je wat nog leuker is
3/24/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hij doet het alleen als ik een knop eruit trek
3/24/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: wij hadden eerst dat ie niet connecte omdat er al inputs op zaten en dat pikt ie niet ofzo
3/24/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Anders nooit
3/24/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hoe bedoel je knop
3/24/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: zon switch of wat
3/24/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Zo'n fisherknoppie
3/24/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: DIe gebruiken we als input
3/24/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ah
3/24/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: BIj andere errors werkt het wel gewoon goed
3/24/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Maar de error state wordt gedeeld door alle errors
3/24/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Staat de display ook op de output op enige wijze?
3/24/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: niet voor zover ik weet
3/24/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: HOLY SHIT KUT UPPAAAL IK WORD DAAR ZO ONTZETTEND AGRESSIEF VAN
3/24/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: TERING WAT N KUT PROGRAMMA
3/24/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: IK WORD HELEMAAL GEK

3/24/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Can you show your code?
3/24/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: #plagiaat
3/24/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: btw @31642623926 are you the one who is also doing the meeloopdag 27 march?
3/24/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes!

3/24/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: since we have no more lectures
3/24/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, I got an OLEBO meeting, an Armadillo meeting, campus tour, and then I am gonna try to go to a different lecture
3/24/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Computer science does not have any lectures, so I will probably go to a maths lecture
3/24/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hmm seems legit
3/24/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, and you have the bestuurspraatje @GEWIS
3/24/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but i kinda dont feel like going to math lectures 😂
3/24/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: the what?
3/24/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The board of GEWIS tells a bit about what GEWIS is and they have
3/24/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: *and what they do
3/24/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: what time are they gonna do that/
3/24/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm, that is variable
3/24/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jeez
3/24/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then how am i supposed to know lol
3/24/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But I'll explain everything in private, to prevent this spam
3/24/17, 12:15 - Bas Gieling: in the mid day break
3/24/17, 12:15 - Bas Gieling: o rick got you
3/24/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: is okeh Rikkert
3/24/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Max, eveything fixed with Uppaal? I can help if youre in pavillion
3/24/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
3/24/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not yet, help would be nice
3/24/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: were in mf tho
3/24/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Will be hard to help then since im at pavilion ^^
3/24/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i fixed the errors i had, but i get some more now
3/24/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i have just one question
3/24/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how do you benoem parameters?
3/24/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: in the system declarations
3/24/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Public variables go in "Declarations"
3/24/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: And local one go into the "Declaration" of a system
3/24/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
3/24/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and
3/24/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: like in a normal state machine
3/24/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how do i assign values to a state?
3/24/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: in the invariable part?
3/24/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or what
3/24/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
3/24/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this is a state in our machine
3/24/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i have one like it in the state machine in uppaal
3/24/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how do i assign the push=1 and such to it in uppaal?
3/24/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Ahh
3/24/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: In your system, give as parameter like :"int time"
3/24/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: And then in Systems declaration say:
push1 = Push(1);

And then: System push1;
3/24/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: That should intialize the system with parameter time set to 1
3/24/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and then change them in update section of the arrows?
3/24/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: You could ye
3/24/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and what about inputs?
3/24/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
3/24/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: like this one
3/24/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: between 2 states
3/24/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: any idea?
3/24/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Which course is this about ?😂
3/24/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: DBL
3/24/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: modeling the statemachine in uppaal
3/24/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You have to set the guard of the edge
3/24/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah i did that rick
3/24/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but
3/24/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i get an immediate dealock
3/24/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: deadlock
3/24/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: since the guard isnt met
3/24/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Do we have to do this ?:o
3/24/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yes
3/24/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31642623926 @31650858649 got any idea?
3/24/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: vol verwachting klopt mijn hart
3/24/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: please
3/24/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm
3/24/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Till how long are you at uni?
3/24/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk
3/24/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: around 16:00
3/24/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i think
3/24/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but this is all i need to know
3/24/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, then I'll be able to drop by
3/24/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how you do inputs
3/24/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ahh, that
3/24/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay, you have to make an "user" automaton that modifies global variables
3/24/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: shit you're right
3/24/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah i see
3/24/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck that is smart
3/24/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: okay
3/24/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks
3/24/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Look at the demos, those are in the UPPAAL folder
3/24/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: holy damn that's such a good idea

3/24/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: updating doesn't work?

3/24/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: it just says its up to date
3/24/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jeah but with non tue windows tho
3/24/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Captain here, I think you already have the latest update
3/24/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: spam=kick
3/24/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: try reinstalling it
3/24/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jeah no shit
3/24/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: that scares me
3/24/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz it says that im gonna uninstall the device
3/24/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it's a thermal thing, what's the worst that can happen
3/24/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: LOL
3/24/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: driver, not the device
3/24/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: CPU burned down?
3/24/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: unlikely, you got 3 more
3/24/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
3/24/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then why does it say confirm device uninstall?
3/24/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes, and then just detect new devices
3/24/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ah aight
3/24/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: if that doesn't work just go to the intel website and download the driver
3/24/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: seems like it fixed itself already
3/24/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: which should make you happy it's not the wifi driver that's fucking up
3/24/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i uninstalled
3/24/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and then it popped back up
3/24/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: with the driver allready installed
3/24/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: working?
3/24/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: technology scares me
3/24/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: it says so
3/24/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: gonna restart my laptop to make sure
3/24/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: well, you've chosen the right study
3/24/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: don't forget to apt-get update
3/24/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: :P
3/24/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jup its alive once more
3/24/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good SfS choice
3/24/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
3/24/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: For A6 6c, would deriving a contradiction prove that there *always* exists a minimax path on T?
3/24/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: And would my counterexample just be an MST on which i find a minimax ? 🤔
3/24/17, 19:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I guess you dont really need a counter example If you want to prove it For every case
3/24/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Prove by contradiction is the way to go for 6c
3/24/17, 19:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Tru
3/24/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
3/24/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ehm
3/24/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Something with the math i believe
3/24/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not sure tho
3/24/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sum notation is not my strongest point
3/24/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ye there is sth wrong but dont know how we explained it
3/24/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Why are you asking?
3/24/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah Well
3/24/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You wanna prove it For k+1
3/24/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: im revising
3/24/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And Then you assume it For k+1
3/24/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So i guess Maybe there
3/24/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But not sure
3/24/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: yeah
3/24/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: IH doesnt exist
3/24/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: ^ that
3/24/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: and the assume k+1 and prove k
3/24/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Stiujn is a smart boi
3/24/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: while you should assume k and prove k+1
3/24/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: thanks niuck
3/24/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: this one assumes k+1 and proves k rite
3/24/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oh ye
3/24/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oki thanksu
3/24/17, 20:16 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yeah the proof basically proofs it for numbers smaller then the base case
3/24/17, 20:17 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: and you wanted to proof it for number larger then the base case in order for the claim to hold
3/24/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: the roster for the embedded system presentations is on canvas
3/25/17, 11:10 - Luke Houben: Hi all,

Some people mentioned a while ago that the "Personal Space" feature was not available.

We decided to change this and set up personal spaces for you to use. Every student can create their personal space on https://cs-students.nl/ . 

To make it easier for you to understand, we made a tutorial which explains how to create a space, set it up for collaborative editing and use the confluence editor with all its features.  It also contains a bit of general information. This tutorial can be found at https://cs-students.nl/x/-wHa .

No more need to use Word to create mathematical documents! Integrated latex plugins, tons of macros and a beautiful editor make it easy and fun to work with.

Hopefully you appreciate the effort that we are putting in and make use (or atleast try it out) of your personal space.

3/25/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Safe spaces!? On our cs-students?
3/25/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fuck your safe spaces
3/25/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Weak fuckin' snowflakes
3/25/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But on cs-students.nl this could come in useful ;p

3/25/17, 14:32 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Am I the only one who has Analysis 2 only in Dutch?
3/25/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Applied mathematics is this year in dutch
3/25/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Next year it will be in English
3/25/17, 14:43 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thanks, I just had mistake in my Osiris registration 
I wanted HTI but had Analysis 2 for some reasons
3/25/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: If I want to say that vertices v and w are connected by and edge E would this be the correct notation (v,w) element of E
3/25/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope, because E is the set of all edges
3/25/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Element of G.E
3/25/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: When using graph G
3/25/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: ahh okay thx 👍🏻
3/25/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I wanna use BFS to get the depth of the nodes from v by using BFS(G,v), that would work right?
3/25/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yes
3/25/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: what should I write down then if I wanna compare a node of that BFS with another node of a different BFS?
3/25/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: is there a special notation for that?
3/25/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Just say that both calls to BFD should store the distance in different properties of the vertex, so one sets du[x] and teh other sets dv[x], or something
3/25/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hehehe, Q8b ?
3/25/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think just saying "compare" because it is pseudocode anyway
3/25/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: <Media omitted>
3/25/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: this picture we can see the MST from the slides
3/25/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: in 6C they say that there always exists a minmax path which is completely on the MST
3/25/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: but according to how I interpreted the definitions  the red path is the minmax path
3/25/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and it is not completely on the MST
3/25/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: where did I go wrong
3/25/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: a minimax path HAS to be on the MST
3/25/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: For both paths, the length of the longest edge is 8
3/25/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: So they can both be minimax paths
3/25/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Aah
3/25/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and since the green one IS on the MST
3/25/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: okay
3/25/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I see now
3/25/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you can say that there exists one that is on the MST
3/25/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yes yes, thanks for the help!

3/25/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I've already figured out how to do it
3/25/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: How many vertices do you guys have, ex5 A6
3/25/17, 18:21 - Bas Gieling: 8
3/25/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah m2 alright thanks :)
3/25/17, 18:22 - Bas Gieling: haha np
3/25/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: |E| and |V| are constants I think. My instructor e-mailed us this:
3/25/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: <Media omitted>
3/25/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Oh fuck it said cannot instead of can
3/25/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: noob
3/25/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Lol
3/25/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
3/25/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: proved whole the fucking algorithm already rip
3/25/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: >tfw
3/25/17, 19:06 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I just love how we just skipped this assignment 😝
3/25/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
3/26/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Can we assume for question 8 DS that the input graph is a connected graph ?
3/26/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes because it is said so in the text
3/26/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh yeah you right
3/26/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: 😂😂😂
3/26/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Not dumb at all
3/26/17, 18:50 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Where does it say so?
3/26/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, I just reread it and it doesn't really say that
3/26/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But how would you do it when it is not connected ?
3/26/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Or when you can't assume this
3/26/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: you  could add an overhead that takes Theta(V+E) time, which does nothing. That is our yet crappy solution
3/26/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ruben is so smart, scientists are amazed by his technique of reading the fucking question 😂
3/26/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Lol😂😂

3/26/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What is analyse 2?
3/26/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hell
3/26/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: A course for mathematics students
3/26/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And no
3/26/17, 21:47 - Bart van Dooren: <Media omitted>
3/26/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: anyoıne choosing introduction to computational science?
3/26/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: :]

3/26/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: Does anyone know how to prove for each vertex v is an element of V{n++}? :P
3/26/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 2 aso for me
3/26/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: whats this

3/26/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: is it easier than intro to comp science
3/26/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope
3/26/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If you want easy, pick HTI
3/26/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i dont like statistics
3/26/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Which is something like 2ID40 or something
3/26/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 2WN50 is intro to comp science
3/26/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You mean next quartile?
3/26/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yes
3/26/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Can you still choose that?
3/26/17, 22:51 - Kevin Jilissen: I've chosen that one
3/26/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Me too ^ 🙂
3/26/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 🙃
3/26/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yes, I'm actually looking forward to it even though I know it's not going to be easy
3/26/17, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I think its going to be like hti
3/26/17, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Should be funfunfun
3/26/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That sounds more like fundamentals
3/26/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Human technology interaction?
3/26/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: HAHAHAHAHAHA
3/26/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Because it's going to be cold ass maths
3/26/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Rick
3/26/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Its the second time
3/26/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
3/26/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Ur laughing at hti
3/26/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He's not laughing at HTI
3/26/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Being as easy as hti
3/26/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, I am laughing at your underestimation
3/26/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: He's laughing at the comparison
3/26/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is going to be a bit like CG I think
3/26/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I think its going to be okay
3/26/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: No wtf
3/26/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Cg no
3/26/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That is like comparing software science to P&T
3/26/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yes it's pure maths
3/26/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: 😍
3/26/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Its not going to be like cg no way
3/26/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You should of course choose it if you want, but it is no way going to be easy
3/26/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is by no means free ECTS
3/26/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Can agree with Rick
3/26/17, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Rick
3/26/17, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I nEed to choose second elective
3/26/17, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Which, without any ill meanings, HTI kinda is
3/26/17, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Other than hti
3/26/17, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Because i dont want to do cg
3/26/17, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wait, why would you need to do CG if you choose HTI?
3/26/17, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's going to be a lot more like cg and calc than it's going to be like HTI
3/26/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I chose cg second q and its too hard for me to pass
3/26/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Where do you even get the HTI comparison from?
3/26/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, so just choose HTI this q?
3/26/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: So i asked roel bloo what can i choose next to hti
3/26/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: The oral exam?
3/26/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: LOL
3/26/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Yiu dont get it i need another elective to compensate cg
3/26/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Oh lord
3/26/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ohh in that way
3/26/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Becuz i droped out of cg
3/26/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well damn
3/26/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ahh, okay
3/26/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Well choose smth from technology and psychology
3/26/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then I'd say some ID bullshit subject or something
3/26/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I am not good at memorizing
3/26/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But no computational sciences haha
3/26/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Did someone here already do analyse 1?
3/26/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I thought roel wouldnt offer me a course as hard as cg since im dropping out of it
3/26/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I'm quite interested
3/26/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Choose something like 0EM310
3/26/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Maybe @31630168397
3/26/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But he's in italy rn so might not respond
3/26/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Ah
3/26/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or 
1BK00
3/26/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: I chose both HTI and Computational Science 🤔
3/26/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: So did isil apparently
3/26/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 2WN50 (int. to comp. sys.) is given by a certain dr. E.F. Kaasschieter
3/26/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Wtf is this
3/26/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Free ECTS
3/26/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: The course name pls
3/26/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: That code doesnt exist
3/26/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It exists
3/26/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wait, nevermind, that one is graduate school level
3/26/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Why
3/26/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Why 2 keuzevakken at the end of the year

3/26/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: This doesnt come up in osiris either
3/26/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lets fuck myself over by adding Some extra workload
3/26/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oh i see
3/26/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then idk what you are doing wrong
3/26/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Can always drop one if I don't like one
3/26/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: True
3/26/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But still
3/26/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: This isnnothing but memorizing
3/26/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I mean i can drop one too If i want
3/26/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I know
3/26/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hell i can even drop out of the study

3/26/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But Thats not gonna earn me my diploma
3/26/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Reading and memorizing
3/26/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Choosing that as an elective doesn't seem like a good idea...
3/26/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Is Healthcare information systems that much memorizing?
3/26/17, 23:32 - Bas Gieling: you should stay far away from analyse 1
3/26/17, 23:33 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 0HK00 Sport motivation and sport performance, free etsc
3/26/17, 23:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: NO THATS SO BAD like p&t
3/26/17, 23:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Exactly like thay

3/26/17, 23:34 - Bas Gieling: why do you even want free ects, youre here to learn stuff youre interested in right
3/26/17, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'm here for baangarantie
3/26/17, 23:35 - Bas Gieling: forreal?
3/26/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: The baangarantie is high in IT at the moment but it's your definitely not certain of baangarantie in the future
3/26/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: A lot of people are studying it now
3/26/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: For Hbo Informatics already has a negative studyadvice by keuzegids
3/26/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ah yes easy ects
3/26/17, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Gainz
3/26/17, 23:38 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I mean, whether I work my ass off or not I'll still get the same piece of paper
3/26/17, 23:38 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: as long as I pass all required subjects
3/26/17, 23:38 - Bas Gieling: is the piece of paper really all you wanna get out of it?
3/26/17, 23:38 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: MBO Lasser would probably be an easier way to get your baangarantie
3/26/17, 23:38 - Bas Gieling: well
3/26/17, 23:39 - Bas Gieling: exactly anne
3/26/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but I don't wanna be a welder
3/26/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I want the piece of paper without putting in more effort than strictly necessary
3/26/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Good thing you are not the student from 3 years ago jort
3/26/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That way you could have ur bachelor with only first grade subjects
3/26/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or What its called
3/26/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Like the ones of niveau 1 Or smth
3/26/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: levels I beleive
3/26/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yeh, if only
3/26/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Of course not. You still have to do your basic courses in the field your studying to get that bachelor degree
3/26/17, 23:43 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And they definitely arent all level 1 subject
3/26/17, 23:43 - Bas Gieling: well, everyone has their own way of looking at things i guess, lol
3/26/17, 23:43 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: true
3/26/17, 23:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and although the paper is nice, some experience and extra curricular knowledge never hurts
3/26/17, 23:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Okay not only in the strict sense of the word
3/26/17, 23:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But Since half of ur bachelor is keuze vakken
3/26/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Its like mostly level 1
3/26/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ah like that
3/27/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fucking level 1
3/27/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and I'm sitting here regretting choosing CG
3/27/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Fuck.
3/27/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: for the final presentation for embed. sys. Are we allowed to show a video of the working machine instead of the actual thing?
3/27/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: prob not
3/27/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Our tutor said a video was a better idea
3/27/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: perhaps you can show a vid if you want, to show like how everything works in detail. but they do want to see a working machine during presentation
3/27/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I just don't wanna hault the thing from pavilion to MF
3/27/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: haul*
3/27/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You have to
3/27/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: ours is fragine af
3/27/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: yup. that always happens
3/27/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: But make sure you have a video of all features
3/27/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If it breaks during transportation you can still show it works
3/27/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: why can't they send pieter to pavilion to test it? make him know what it feels like
3/27/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Worked*
3/27/17, 10:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Fragile ? Sounds like its not penproof 🦑
3/27/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: You have to bring it to him to show, which was told at the start. So you kinda had to build something that can be transportes
3/27/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Transported*
3/27/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: We'll find a way
3/27/17, 10:20 - Luke Houben: Or you tear it down and build it up again

3/27/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Visit the study counselor
3/27/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: And let him check if your registered for the resit
3/27/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: does anyone know how to do this one
3/27/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
3/27/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Crying worked for me
3/27/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: find partial derivatives
3/27/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: compute x for given values
3/27/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: (given: x=4)
3/27/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: yes
3/27/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you know what no im not gonna explain just look at the practice exercises
3/27/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thats what i did
3/27/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: yeah but this one isnt in the practice
3/27/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: in this form
3/27/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It is
3/27/17, 14:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 100% there is one
3/27/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it is
3/27/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i got it from there
3/27/17, 14:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: They use the same databas
3/27/17, 14:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I bet there is one that is exactly the same
3/27/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: therebis
3/27/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: trust me
3/27/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i got my answer from it
3/27/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ah i find one
3/27/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: thank you
3/27/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: for people doing math test 7 for modeling, for question 7 there is no example question in then "practice" stuff.. But i figured the answer by trying a lot of numbers. So, get a question for question 7 with rate of change points (3,0) or (2,0) and equal to 0. The answer is then (0,1) :)
3/27/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Thanks
3/27/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You're a hero
3/27/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: glad i could help :)
3/27/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: How did you figur it out though lol
3/27/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: well, first you start of with trying (1,1) then (2,1) up until 10. Then you realize, hey maybe try (0,1) and tadaa :D
3/27/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Lol hahaha
3/27/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ty btw
3/27/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: Thx m8
3/27/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: (3,0) and (3,0) equal to 0 is also (0,1)
3/27/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: So basically try (0,1) untill correct
3/27/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Just calculate it backwards
3/27/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Remember my wild guesses @31628151420
3/27/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: First try correct
3/27/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: This works if you look at how question 5 of the test works it is realy easy to find the answer to q7
3/27/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for the final examination, there is no math included, right? only mc questions about the lectures/lecture notes(and not the math lectures)
3/27/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for modelling, that is
3/27/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I believe there is
3/27/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: but its prob in the mc since its 90% mc or so
3/27/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: check some previous exams if you want to be sure
3/27/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Math is included, they specifically said for the midterm that math would not be included in the midterm but it would be in the final exam
3/27/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ah, I missed that, thanks!
3/27/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: its 50/50
3/27/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: 20 question about maths and 20 about modeling if i recall correctly
3/27/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 45% maths, 45% modeling, 10% questions about your modeling process
3/27/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: = 100% bullshit
3/27/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: 100% true
3/27/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lol, that are 4 questions about our process, aka free points? :p
3/27/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nope, that 10% is an open question
3/27/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh whoops
3/27/17, 17:24 - Luke Houben: Basically people who are not good with the maths are screwed
3/27/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: are calculators allowed at least?
3/27/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nope, don't think ao
3/27/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: so*
3/27/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And no Luke, considering it's multiple choice all of them, and they should be the same as the weekly practice
3/27/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So a little repetition and learning-by-heart should get us far
3/27/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And 45% is about theory
3/27/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Btw, calculus is mandatory for everyone and this stuff has been way easier so far
3/27/17, 17:27 - Luke Houben: True
3/27/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sometimes they ask really weird questions though, but then all you need to do is differentiate and fill in some values haha
3/27/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Weirdos
3/27/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Do any of you get stuck sometimes while logging in at mytue? Sometimes when I log on it goes to a blank page and I'll have to open mytue again and I'll be logged in..
3/27/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, that is just the ugly face detection working

3/28/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'll look for that "an message" then
3/28/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: <Media omitted>
3/28/17, 15:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: am I the only one who knows Sioux?

3/28/17, 15:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: well Sioux apparently do a lot of specific machinery and components. not reall a standalone company but they work for other bigger Corporations so its cool I gues
3/28/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: They can smell it

3/28/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Next time unnecessary meme's or comments get sent or made you're gone
3/28/17, 16:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: woah there boi isthis a threat ?
3/28/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: it's memes btw
3/28/17, 16:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: some people get way too much balls when they receive a little power in their cuck life
3/28/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Does anyone have a solidworks fischertechnik kit?
3/28/17, 16:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: uuuuh what do you need rick ?
3/28/17, 16:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I mean could it be possible we have it here
3/28/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, I mean like for the software
3/28/17, 16:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: aaah sorry then
3/28/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There's one for sketchup
3/28/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, we are modeling our machine in solidworks for fancy schwanzy renderings, and I don't want to model every part myself tbh :P
3/28/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: It's not a threat it's just that this keeps being used as a fun chat which it's not. Maybe this will help
3/28/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
3/28/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Then take sketch up lol, less fancy schwanzy but also less time consuming ;D
3/28/17, 16:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: rick sketch up has almost the same already done
3/28/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm
3/28/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I might install it then
3/28/17, 16:21 - Luke Houben: Those company visits were mandatory right?
3/28/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Jup
3/28/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Where can I find the fischertechnik-parts?
3/28/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: In the boxes you got from the start of this quartile
3/28/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Verdomme Kees😂
3/28/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nevermind, I found them
3/28/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: KUTKEES
3/28/17, 16:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: go to 3dwarehouse and type fiischertechnik
3/28/17, 16:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: keep in mind some parts are not whole
3/28/17, 16:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: for example the leds need to be made from two parts
3/28/17, 16:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: the lightbulb itself abd the black box
3/28/17, 16:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: most of the stuff doesn't  tho so its pretty easy
3/28/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: you can acces 3d warehouse from the sketchup itself
3/28/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, I tried, but I like solidworks better
3/28/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: why are you people putting so much effort into this? 3d modelling seems rather unnecessary when you can just draw your machine.
3/28/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: How do you guys know this, its not mentioned any where
3/28/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You have these things called tutors and seniors who you can ask all sorts of stuff, weird ey?
3/28/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: But why dont mention in the mail that its mandatory when they always do this
3/28/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: they probably assume you already know, it was mentioned in quite a few bloo presentations
3/28/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and it's mostly fun so they don't really expect to have to force people to go
3/28/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: yeah except for the fact that the only company i thought was interesting is already full
3/28/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Then you should have gone to the bloo.lectures to know about it, and have been faster to check.your mail. Can't say much else
3/28/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I haven't had contact with my tutor since the 1st quartile; he finished his study in february as he only had 1 subject he needed to pass
3/28/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: (this has nothing to do with the visits btw or any bloo info lecture)
3/28/17, 18:50 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Wait company visits already passed??
3/28/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: No
3/28/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: But you can register now
3/28/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: And one of the companies is already full
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Believe it was the one for intel
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: intel
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Oh allright
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I;m going vanderlande
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Yeah, I'm going.l there too
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Same 👆🏻
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 👊🏻
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Intel that is
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Sorry jort
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Typing slowly
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 😱
3/28/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Its not i wanted to work for an israeli company anyways
3/28/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'd have gone there if there was any place
3/28/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Rip
3/28/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'm surprised defensie hasn't arranged something. Especially as they bombard (punintended) your FB page with posts about how you should join them
3/28/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Where can we sign up?
3/28/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Link in the message on canvas
3/28/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: oh never mind
3/28/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: DS grades are online
3/28/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 9/14 for assignment :D
3/28/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Noice Daan
3/28/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Could all the people who have had data structures and upload their high graded (& possibly commented) assignments to cs-students.nl ? There's a special file space for those. This way people who got a lower grade for that assigment can take a good look at the answers for the exam since Speckmann said there's a very high chance of some exercises returning to the exam.
3/28/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: -and in the first sentence, no idea why I put that there...
3/28/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What's considered "high graded"
3/28/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 👆🏻
3/28/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: 80%?
3/28/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: 8 or higher I'd say
3/28/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: (As in mark not as in points )
3/28/17, 20:31 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Oki
3/28/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah somewhere around the level of "with the comments the teacher made this is good enough to suffice as training material for others"
3/28/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I uploaded the four I had with 2 or less points subtracted
3/28/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Thanks!!
3/28/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: no problem

3/28/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Uploaded mine too
3/28/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No time pressure in there ;) As long as it is before the exam they'll be useful for people
3/28/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Thanks Anne!
3/28/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: wow anne what is your average?

3/28/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Wait so you only missed 2 points on all of those 5?
3/28/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Damn that's really impressive indeed

Thx :)
3/28/17, 21:27 - Luke Houben: Np

3/28/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why would you open Datastructures on Oncourse :p
3/28/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Mohamed try different browser if it keeps not working
3/28/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Chrome and oncourse dont work togheter for me
3/28/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: anyone done last question of math quiz 7 from modeling?
3/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: (0,1)
3/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: ^
3/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Reverse engineer it from q5
3/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: If you solved q5
3/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yeah
3/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: but wolfram alfa then says
3/28/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: You can follow the same strategy at 7 but the other way around
3/28/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: x<0, y = -(805 sqrt(x^2))/1153 - (348 x)/1153
3/28/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I did that
3/28/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Just fill all the numbers in without wolfram, wolfram tends to do things too hard
3/28/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
3/28/17, 22:02 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i hope they have carb free lunch

3/29/17, 08:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is it just asking people for advice?
3/29/17, 08:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yes
3/29/17, 08:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And ask for experience and what not
3/29/17, 08:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alrighty
3/29/17, 08:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: At what time does it start?

3/29/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guys you're coming to tutor uur right?
3/29/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31631192870 @31643222030 @31628151420 @31643470096  enzo
3/29/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: haha nee
3/29/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nooo
3/29/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: :(
3/29/17, 08:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The other faggots?
3/29/17, 08:43 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I don't think so
3/29/17, 08:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jesus
3/29/17, 08:43 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I mean like
3/29/17, 08:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why though
3/29/17, 08:43 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It's pretty useless rn though, isn't it?
3/29/17, 08:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This morning I finally got up like hey! It's useless but it is nice to see the others again and laugh a bit and get up early and be productive and stuff
3/29/17, 08:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And now this
3/29/17, 08:44 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Hahahaha
3/29/17, 08:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Even you..
3/29/17, 08:45 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I'm sorry Daan

3/29/17, 08:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There are exactly 7 people here including me
3/29/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: 7?
3/29/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I feel sorry for tutor when not paying attention now
3/29/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes, 7
3/29/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That's actually still quite a lot
3/29/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I expected way less
3/29/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The 6 who sit in the front every week and myself
3/29/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Ohhh I see
3/29/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But now I'm awkwardly alone in the back
3/29/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The whole right side of the classroom is empty
3/29/17, 08:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: On the left the first row is filled and second row half

3/29/17, 08:48 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I believe that

3/29/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Stef, our tutor has been way too nice

3/29/17, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Could have formulated that a bit better
3/29/17, 09:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
3/29/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Ik ben dus enzo

3/29/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I am
3/29/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: @31642623926 is
3/29/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: gg
3/29/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: apply text 2 speech on it and done
3/29/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Seriously?
3/29/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: He will upload it to cs-student
3/29/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: God
3/29/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Nevermind memory full halfway
3/29/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Yup 53 minutes is too much for whatsapp
3/29/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Isn't it then technically speech to text?
3/29/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You're a hero mate
3/29/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: If the recording failed there are two more ;) (don't know if they're any good though)
3/29/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'll check if it is any good later today, if so I'll put it on cs-students due to it being 18Mb and I don't wanna spam everyones phone with it
3/29/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
3/29/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Does anyone know where on osiris the use packages are?
3/29/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Ruben ILY
3/29/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: who doesnt right
3/29/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: true, everyone loves rubain
3/29/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: what is this?

3/29/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You pick the max amount of those two
3/29/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which would be 1606 here
3/29/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: oh lol
3/29/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: that simple eh?
3/29/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep

3/29/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Should i give this in percentage or is the answer just wrong
3/29/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: okay nvm appearantly i fucked up
3/29/17, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: In which quartile is the final project of Software Science ?
3/29/17, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: In Y3
3/29/17, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 4
3/29/17, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah alright, cuz planapp says 1, or is that a different thing?
3/29/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Software/web engineering project
3/29/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Planapp fails
3/29/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: It 100% does lol
3/29/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: guys, when you participate in a honours track, does that imply you can do fewer use courses? I thought someone mentioned it at some point
3/29/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I think it is extra
3/29/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Adds like 30ects
3/29/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: You do get extra points, but you still have to do all other courses afaik
3/29/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I think so too
3/29/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Honors tracks go as an additional load to your study. You still have to do other regular 180 credits.
3/29/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: you have to still do all normal courses and electives and such. as well do you need 60 CEST on the end of your 2nd year as well
3/29/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: jup and if you drop out the day before finishing the honours you get 0/30 bonus points
3/29/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: which is quite the bummer
3/29/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: so it's give or take
3/29/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: all or nothing
3/29/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You only got one shot, don't miss your chance to blow
3/29/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: this opportunity only comes once in a lifetime?
3/29/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You can also do it in Q1
3/29/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So what can you do with 30 extra ECTS?
3/29/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh really, did not know that
3/29/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: brag at your job interview
3/29/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: 👆🏻
3/29/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: masturbate at the thought of how awesome you are
3/29/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Seems like a really good trade off
3/29/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: already do that
3/29/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: don't need 30 extra etcs for that
3/29/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, the SEP in Q1 is only meant for if you miss it in Q4, right?
3/29/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: IIRC Bloo or Yves said you can also do it in Q1
3/29/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I believe only if you need the time in q4 for electives
3/29/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Well its not called Final project for nothing
3/29/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What do you actually do in a Final project?
3/29/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Osiris was also called an "improvement". Tue does care about what things are called
3/29/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You got me There
3/29/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Build a large software system, for example one of the projects is building a new version of GoudGlans, which is a system GEWIS uses to manage their sponsor money
3/29/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Like that kind of scale
3/29/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ohh nice
3/29/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I thought it would be some boring documentation shit
3/29/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: write the documentation on what you did in the previous years
3/29/17, 18:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: added the recording of the final DS lecture on cs-students: https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/%5B2IL50%5D+Data+Structures

quality is good enough I'd say, please try and ignore the people talking through it :)
3/29/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's the link to Luke's assignments
3/29/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nvm
3/29/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: Why do I keep getting emails from cs-students?
3/29/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You are probably watching some spaces
3/29/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Unwatch them
3/29/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: we put a tutorial on the homepage
3/29/17, 19:09 - Luke Houben: 👆🏻
3/29/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 👆🏻

3/29/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Is the DBL App Development (2IS70) doable without Web technology (2ID60)?
3/29/17, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: No, not for us, because software science/web science students already did programming, meaning we can't do the programming subject from the package. Because of this, you need both 2ID60 and 2ID40
3/29/17, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is the business programing course in Y3 in Q3? It's on Q1 for me
3/29/17, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Sucks that a lot of the needed subjects are in Q2
3/29/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Anyone got an interesting CS course that's for Q1?
3/29/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Nope. The handout from today, Planapp and Osiris all say Q3
3/29/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh that makes it way better imo
3/29/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I want to do security and IIS but haven't done computer graphics in Q2 so dunno if that's gonna work
3/29/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks
3/29/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Same, with use it is quite unfortunate I think
3/29/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But on the other hand I'd gladly take 6 months extra for that
3/29/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Exactly my thought lol, on planapp my bachelor is already 4 years :/
3/29/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: I guess you could take a USE package for Y2Q1, Y3Q3, Y3Q4 and take CS on Y2Q2?
3/29/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I had been thinking about that option as well just have to look into it a bit more closely
3/29/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Wouldn't mind 4 subject for some quartiles as well
3/29/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This is my plan, yeah
3/29/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You wanne do IIS and security too? ;D
3/29/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, I am gonna do IIS and Data Science
3/29/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Or move DBL Algorithms over to Y2Q4 and take Use Y2Q1, Y2Q2, Y3Q3/4. If you move the USE's I guess there is some room.
3/29/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oehf that sounds nice too
3/29/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Faaaack so much thing are interesting
3/29/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: What is ISS
3/29/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: IIS
3/29/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Interactive intelligent systems
3/29/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: International Space Station
3/29/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: LOL
3/29/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If you take 4 subjects in 1 quartile, you've got one other quartile with "just" 3 subjects, right?
3/29/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: ^
3/29/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: 2 subjects*
3/29/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Depends
3/29/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or just do 4 years instead of 3
3/29/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Like who cares
3/29/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lol
3/29/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: By the way, is 2IW80 a SfS course? It doesn't show up in my timetable on planapp
3/29/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: What is it?
3/29/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
3/29/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What are InfS students btw?

3/29/17, 23:39 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Software Science
3/29/17, 23:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ah
3/29/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But how does the security package work then? It has 5 packages, 1 of them is only for non InfS students, 2 cancel each other out and the other two depend on  those
3/29/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Can we compelete that package with just 2 things then?
3/29/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh wait
3/29/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You choose one of those that cancel each other out and then the other 2
3/29/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I just can't read
3/29/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That makes 3
3/29/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not sure about that, But i suppose it can be the case Since we have Some security subjects standard right?

3/29/17, 23:43 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If you are illiterate 160% doesn't help...
3/29/17, 23:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ja ik snapte 't ook niet helemaal maar volgens meneer de opticien was 't helemaal goed en zag ik meer dan dat ik zou moeten zien

3/30/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Describe the individual components in your machine, why they are needed, and their test cases
3/30/17, 09:33 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: So you want me to count every piece i used
3/30/17, 09:33 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: And its serial code and stuff?
3/30/17, 09:33 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Nono
3/30/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Just say 'we have a component in our machine that puts the disks from the tube on a belt'
3/30/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And 'we have a component that scans the colour of the disks'
3/30/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And 'we have a start button'
3/30/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Etc

3/30/17, 09:45 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: And do we need to have an acceptance test in our report? And, if so, what should i put in it? :P
3/30/17, 09:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: guys do we know how we hand in the documentation for DBL ( as in printed or by mail?)
3/30/17, 09:47 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: User acceptance test you mean? Make the test, write down why the tests cover the user requirements, but you don't actually do the tests, because the client should do them
3/30/17, 09:47 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I think
3/30/17, 09:47 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Via canvas, so digitally
3/30/17, 09:48 - Kevin Jilissen: Our tutor said 2 printed version excluding appendices like code, and one digitally

3/30/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ah okay
3/30/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We were having trouble with displaying shit and our tutor suggested to create a debugging mode and all our problems where gone

3/30/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 36162959‬: Near the exit or at auditorium are the most easy ones
3/30/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 36162959‬: Easiest*
3/30/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Thanks :)
3/30/17, 18:13 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Just in front of every exit is a place you can pay i believe

3/30/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But now that I live in Eindhoven I don't use it anymore
3/30/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Wait that can get you a card for free?

4/2/17, 00:03 - Bas Gieling: right when i was about to answer it :(
4/2/17, 00:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Anne, is there anything you are bad at?
4/2/17, 00:05 - Bas Gieling: i doubt it, and ive been looking for such thing for a while
4/2/17, 00:07 - Bas Gieling: same goes for hugo btw
4/2/17, 00:12 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Sing in tune
4/2/17, 00:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Seems like you were helping out the mathematics students simultaneously
4/2/17, 00:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I also think your farts smell really bad, right?
4/2/17, 00:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: There must be multiple things
4/2/17, 00:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Do u poop
4/2/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Asking the real questions
4/2/17, 00:23 - Bas Gieling: true, though less clearly xD
4/2/17, 01:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂😂
4/2/17, 01:20 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: more of a third date kinda question

4/2/17, 05:15 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: What were the SFS specific chapters of Physics
4/2/17, 05:15 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: And does someone still has the ppt of week 4 for Sfs?

4/2/17, 06:08 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: U mean the physics pdf for w4 ? 😅
4/2/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Thank you! ^^
4/2/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Yedd
4/2/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: *Yess
4/2/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Are these the faculty specific ones?
4/2/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sort of
4/2/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You have Physics A and B
4/2/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So they probably are specific to the variant, but not to the faculty
4/2/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because SFS for example had Physics together with P&T
4/2/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And some other alpha faculty I think
4/2/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Ahh I see
4/2/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: <Media omitted>
4/2/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: What is bdk part?
4/2/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: What operation can be executed more efficiently with a sorted array than with a RB tree ?
4/2/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: find kth biggest element
4/2/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 👆🏻
4/2/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Getting the maximum element
4/2/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Or the maximum
4/2/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: or the minimum?
4/2/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ahhh 
Thx everyone :)

4/2/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Neil degrasse tyson doing an ama right now
4/2/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Can someone tell me why searching in a sorted array takes log n but in a sorted list takes n ?
4/2/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Where did you get that info from?
4/2/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Because you cant see the length of a linked list maybe?
4/2/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Eh the summary
4/2/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: So you cant take the "middle" element
4/2/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm, that makes sense
4/2/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: That would make sense
4/2/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Thanks
4/2/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
4/2/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, T👎 = 3T(n/2)
4/2/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And then some else
4/2/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: 3 calls on the recursion, so a = 3
4/2/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: they give b
4/2/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: and the other stuff you need to add is what comes after
4/2/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: so that's one for loop
4/2/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: + the other subroutine which is theta(i)
4/2/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: so you basically still need to add n^2
4/2/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Thank you guys 👍🏻
4/2/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: A list is a _sequential_ data structure, while an array is a _random-access_ data structure.
4/2/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: list has no pointers
4/2/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: no beginning or end specified, it's just linked numbers
4/2/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: So you cant just pick the middle?
4/2/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: like you did for the computer systems exam
4/2/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: nope, cause you only know where it starts
4/2/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Ah thanks!!
4/2/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: List elements do not have indices
4/2/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Only links to the next element
4/2/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: That is why it is sequential
4/2/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I think I get it, thanks a lot!
4/3/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys
4/3/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: for data structures
4/3/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is there a way to do the quizzes again without the answers?
4/3/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Afaik not
4/3/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But you could email Arthur about it
4/3/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He might be able to set someting up
4/3/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: <Media omitted>
4/3/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Does this mean I can't get a 5.0 anymore?
4/3/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Ye, i had that mail too, i think they fucked something up
4/3/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Oh wait
4/3/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: They jusy mean with final grade assignments that they count and the other one not anymore
4/3/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: That they counted the 5 best assignments
4/3/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Aaah okay
4/3/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Thanks for the clarification ;)
4/3/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah it's the quizzes and assignments together
4/3/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hey I got a question regarding Modeling
4/3/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ACCEL gives us a nice error we do not understand
4/3/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which my partner just fixed
4/3/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So thanks :p
4/3/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you're welcome
4/3/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: next time do it in java
4/3/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would prefer that bigtime
4/3/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Tutor prefers ACCEL
4/3/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: end your tutor
4/3/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No he's a nice guy!
4/3/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Helps as much as he can
4/3/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: nice guys finish last
4/3/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Except when they're with bad girls
4/3/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
4/3/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nice guys mostly finish first I think
4/3/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Tend to have had less practice
4/3/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Whoops this is the no spam chat, sorry @31642007885
4/3/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: can't finish last if you never start ey
4/3/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
4/3/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
4/3/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
4/3/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So its true?
4/3/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What about the one before that?
4/3/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
4/3/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yes I think so
4/3/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: But state c > 0
4/3/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The one before that is also true, because if c * 2^n is an upper bound, c * 3^n certainly is, with c > 0
4/3/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Since you get a flip of the ≤ if you divide by a negative number
4/3/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yeah true
4/3/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But I thought it wasnt necessary because c is per definition >0
4/3/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But perhaps it's better to still state it
4/3/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thanks guys🙃
4/3/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Since you are using the definition of O(...) to prove it is probably better to use it completely
4/3/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: But do you only have to state true or false for that exercise?
4/3/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: True
4/3/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yess
4/3/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nvm just check te box
4/3/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You only have to check them
4/3/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No explanation needed
4/3/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But its Nice to see how it works
4/3/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Got a question where smartass SfS'ers can show their superior intellect to us plebsciencers
4/3/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How do I make a for loop out of if statements
4/3/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If I can
4/3/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because fuck Accel
4/3/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 19979158‬: if you want a loop you at least need a statement to branch back to the start of the loop
4/3/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You mean like "Loop if x = true"? That's just a while loop. while(x > 5) { ... }
4/3/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Or you mean in ACCEL code?
4/3/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 19979158‬: a for loop is just an if loop with a counter
4/3/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 19979158‬: oops
4/3/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 19979158‬: i mean
4/3/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 19979158‬: a for loop is just a while loop with a counter
4/3/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I mean how can we do that in Accel indeed
4/3/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because we need it or it doesn't work haha
4/3/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah because you have 53 derivations and make life really hard for yourself
4/3/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is there a while or for loop in ACCEL?
4/3/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or how did you guys fix that
4/3/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Where is 0.094?
4/3/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is not an answer to the question Jort
4/3/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: :p
4/3/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Basement
4/3/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: 0.094 sound like an alternate name for one of the MF# rooms
4/3/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
4/3/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Afaik i=0
4/3/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Should always be i=0 yeah
4/3/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: otherwise all the ones from this exercise would paste on the first go which i would guess would be too easy haha
4/3/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: thanks
4/3/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Because you first try fitting it in without using the second hashing function
4/3/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
4/3/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: 12 isnt prime
4/3/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: ah alright
4/3/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: thanks
4/3/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: So if the result of h2 is 6 it would keep switching between the same 2 hokjes
4/3/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: 6*2 would cancel out by mod 12
4/3/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: 6*3 =6 6*4 would cancel out again etc etc.
4/3/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Np
4/3/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: aha
4/3/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: = p?
4/3/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
4/3/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice
4/3/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: is there any way to check the practise exams and are there more of them? only found the 2 on the canvas page and gewis dont seem to have any
4/3/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Yeah its strange
4/3/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: They copy from the rest I guess
4/3/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So dont want to give it out
4/3/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Make those exams and all difficult assignment exercises
4/3/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Know the runtimes and algorithms (what they do and why some are better in some cases)
4/3/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then you're fine
4/3/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Aka what speckman told
4/3/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: It would be great if someone could upload solutions for the 2 exams
4/3/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: There aren't any
4/3/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Answers for the assignments are uploaded to cs-students
4/3/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: "exams"
4/3/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If someone makes an exam and is pretty sure about their answers you can upload em there too
4/3/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Could email your solutions to your instructor tho and im sure hell check it for u
4/3/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I'll upload my solutions on like wednesday or so
4/3/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Yup Ruben, that's what I'm suggesting
4/3/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Like the drive functioned last quartile
4/3/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: There will be an instruction hour on thursday where they will discuss an exam
4/3/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: If anyone is interested
4/3/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: At what time @31623080897 ?
4/3/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: 17:00-18:00
4/3/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Normal instruction hour times
4/3/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: ooh like the office hours?
4/3/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Kaulo dan ben ik weg

4/5/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It has some small mistakes, but in general it is pretty good
4/5/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: It gives a nice summary of the theory but you still need to practice how to apply said theory yourself.
4/5/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: true dat

4/5/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Osiris thinks it is a fitfth course, so it gives an error
4/5/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: On osiris search for 0SAB0A
4/5/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And choose the ones you want
4/5/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Fucking osiris
4/5/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Why aren't you allowed to do 5 courses... That's stupid
4/5/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Why not 0SAB0C?
4/5/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Depends on which timeslot you have it in
4/5/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And what is the difference between 0SAB0 and 0SAB0A/C?
4/5/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: in my mail it said C
4/5/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: The timeslot
4/5/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But I am registered for both 0SAB0 and 0SAB0A? Is that correct?
4/5/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ja
4/5/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: volgens mij wel
4/5/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Okeoke gelukkig :)
4/5/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: Everybody who has issues registering for any type of 0SAB0 because "Registration would cause maximum number of study credits per block to be exceeded. Registration not possible.", you can send a mail to M.G.T.G.Sannes@tue.nl with your preference list and she'll take care of it for you!
4/5/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I got an email just to wait
4/5/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Don't overload the poor people that have to handle osiris
4/5/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: I got an email it got fixed 1 hour ago 🤷🏻‍♂
4/5/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: everyone got that
4/5/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: at least they should have
4/5/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Not me :^)
4/5/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then i guess you are not a person
4/5/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Or wait
4/5/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: The complete email is just retarded
4/5/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: thats true
4/5/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: It has all 3 previous emails in there
4/5/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Without divider or anything
4/5/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: however, you should have received one at approximately 11:41
4/5/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: So I just read the red text
4/5/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Which told me to fuck off
4/5/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Fucking genius system this

4/5/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: wait sorry that time is from when i joined the course
4/5/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Are you supposed to get an email after registering? Because I can't see anywhere if I really got registered
4/5/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I got one I think
4/5/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Do you guys include your minutes in the modeling report?
4/5/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: @31643222030 lets just not do that
4/5/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: We dont even have minutes...
4/5/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We have them but I think if we were to include them our report would get rejected
4/5/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Thats why we should not include them
4/5/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For vulgarity, making fun of our tutor and a shitton of other shit
4/5/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Sorry for that btw
4/5/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Our tutor wants them  separately
4/5/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If our tutor wants to see them we're truly fucked lol
4/5/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Or we need to forge some new ones quickly
4/5/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But how do your minutes look then?
4/5/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ours are only "We did this and this and we said we should work on this next time"
4/5/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Minutes for modelling... Really?
4/5/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ehm

4/5/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: you don't have to include them right?
4/5/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Tim heeft een v hals aan vandaag
4/5/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Het staat hem echt niet

4/5/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ruben probeert slim te lijken met zijn STEK. (Stack)
Ruben is voor het lapje gehouden, want Jan Friso is helemaal geen stackspert.
Stef probeert te zorgen dat Tim iets zegt.
Tim gaat 3 Maart weg. Van te voren een mail ‘opzetten’ met vragen. Hij kijkt op vakantie ook nog een paar keer.

4/5/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if youve got IIS and you want the robots USE package, then design for games and play doesnt fit
4/5/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: app develompent is stated to be not interesting for SfS or Wbs students
4/5/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: aight thanks
4/5/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I don't have to do use since I'm taking the education track
4/5/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: So I'm doing those two packages already
4/5/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ohhh nice
4/5/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: wait wut
4/5/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: can you do education instead of use?
4/5/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: But I think I'm gonna take a 4th year for my bachelor so I don't have to do 4 courses in a quartile and take some extra maths courses so I can more easily get my 2nd degree in maths in my Masters
4/5/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: If you do both educational packages you dont have to do use, however you still have to do the sg activities and write a letter to the exam committee with your motivation for your choice
4/5/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: are the use courses supposed to be in a specific order?
4/5/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: does anyone know?
4/5/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: You should take them In level order I think, they build on knowledge of t he previous course I think
4/5/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you have exploration-specialization-project
4/5/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: in what order shoudl they go?
4/5/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: That's the order
4/5/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright good
4/5/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: im gonna do fundamentals in Q4 of Y2
4/5/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck it
4/5/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: gotta get those credits
4/5/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Do realize that you need a certain number of level 2 and 3 courses
4/5/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah i was only joking hihi
4/5/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Haha you could have just chosen it if you have enough other harder courses if you really wanted to :p would have made data structures easier from what I've heard Haha
4/5/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah well i mean choosing it in Y2Q4 wouldnt help with ds would it
4/5/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Depends, maybe you fail data structures twice
4/5/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hope not
4/5/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: That's a pretty realistic prediction for me :p
4/5/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: How many did you need again?
4/5/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>

4/5/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's on cs students
4/5/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i cant find it lol
4/5/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Not sure, wasn't it somewhere on the slides from last p-colloqial meeting?
4/5/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: https://cs-students.nl/questions/14287840/how-to-calculate-the-direction-of-the-vector @31643470096
4/5/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lol i just found it at the same time
4/5/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but thanks babe

4/5/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what was the lecturer for CS called again?
4/5/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Jan Frise "Stekspert" Groote
4/5/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Friso*
4/5/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: all exercises apart from the last one have practise exercises of it on oncourse with solutions and 'uitwerkingen'
4/5/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah i know
4/5/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but i had struggles with the last one
4/5/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lol
4/5/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but its all fixed now
4/5/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Last one is just filling in your coördinates but reversed :p
4/5/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Was real easy guess
4/5/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Lol please include them they are hilarious. Pray he does not understand dutch tho.
4/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, where can I find which pages should we read in introduction to Algorithms?
4/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: The pages are not really given to us
4/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: however, these chapters were discussed during the exam and are thus the chapters you could study if you want
4/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: <Media omitted>
4/5/17, 16:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thanks!!
4/5/17, 16:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Isnt cujoers supposed to be here ?
4/5/17, 16:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Who the fuck closes at 16.30
4/5/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Uuh
4/5/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Someone who started at any time before 8:30?
4/5/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering working days are 08:00
4/5/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Eight hours*
4/5/17, 16:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Work days are from 8 to 17
4/5/17, 16:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sorry to dissapoint
4/5/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No
4/5/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's one option
4/5/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Cousin starts at 07:30 en works intil 16:30
4/5/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or sometimes earlier
4/5/17, 16:48 - Bas Gieling: my workday is 23 to 4
4/5/17, 16:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Depends
4/5/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He can also start at 10:00 en go home around 19:00
4/5/17, 16:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Luttik ... when he is here... is from 8 to 17
4/5/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Choose the best option to avoid traffic
4/5/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but that could be his choice haha
4/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you subtract the hour lunch break that is exactly 8 hours
4/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ... ok i guess we hand in our thing tomorrow
4/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So if cujoers guy started at 7:30 he is gone at 16:30
4/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'd do the same
4/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The sun is shining
4/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Go live your life

4/5/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: They spammed
4/5/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: They will be added tomorrow again
4/5/17, 18:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Looks like they stole John Wick's car and killed his dog
4/5/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: does that also mean that turtle mean will soon be excommunicated by this chat?
4/5/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: *turtle man
4/5/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Im not sure that Thats How it works florian
4/5/17, 20:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He is more like the owner of the Continental
4/5/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I like the reference but it's not related to the study

4/6/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: isnt it enough to show that, if you have 2 arrays of 1 element, you cant merge them in 2n-2 time since that would mean it doesnt do any comparisons?
4/6/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: maybe i have a better chance at getting an answer here than in the data structures group
4/6/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬ added ‪+31 6 31192870‬
4/6/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬ added ‪+31 6 28151420‬
4/6/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬ added ‪+31 6 43222030‬
4/6/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyone?
4/6/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬ added ‪+31 6 30168397‬
4/6/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You have to do it more general, if you prove it for 2 arrays of 1 element it isn't a proof for an array of more elements
4/6/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no, but you dont have to prove it for all possibilities
4/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: So you should argue that with 2n-2 comparisons not all elements in the array can be compared?
4/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you jsut have to show that its *sometimes* necessary
4/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no, i mean like
4/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i wanna say that theres 2 arrays with 1 element
4/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and
4/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if the running time is 2n-2
4/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that would mean that it doesnt need comparisons in that case
4/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: which isnt true
4/6/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so we cant always use 2n-2 comparisons
4/6/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: which means its sometimes necessary to use 2n-1
4/6/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: why would that not be correct?
4/6/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It sounds correct to me tbh
4/6/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I understand where you are coming from, but I'm pretty sure the *sometimes* is added because you can also have two sorted arrays in which the first element of the second array is already bigger than like half of the first array
4/6/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Meaning you definitely don't need 2n-1 comparisons
4/6/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Your answer is probably correct, but that is just because of the way you choose to interpret the question
4/6/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: If you merge 2 arrays with 2n-2 comparisons there will be an element a[i] which is not compared to either b[j] or b[j+1]
4/6/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Make 2 cases
4/6/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I know Thorn
4/6/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I know how to solve it that way
4/6/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but
4/6/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And I doubt they will formulate it the same way on the test, seeing we had this discussion earlier during the assignments
4/6/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this is waaaayy easier and shorter to write doen
4/6/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and not wrong
4/6/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: But as is now, I *do* solve the question this way
4/6/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dont I?
4/6/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Max you need to show it holds for big enough n's
4/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: N=1 is big enough
4/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Isnt*
4/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it is
4/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: N \geq 1
4/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: You need to show it for an arbitrary size
4/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Is what i ment to say
4/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the question doesnt say that though
4/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you just made that up
4/6/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I think max understands that thorn, but with the way they formulated the question his answer is technically correct
4/6/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: It does not but thats how those proofs need to be approached
4/6/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: You need to solve it for every n. Badly formulated, but we had this discussion and any = every according to the great people of DS
4/6/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But that's not what they're asking nor saying right? They're asking for any n larger or equal to 1
4/6/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: exactly ruben
4/6/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: I got told i should stfu when i asked this question to people at question hour
4/6/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: They told me to do it for arbitrary size of n
4/6/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You need to do it for an arbitrary size of n
4/6/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Than the question is badly formulated lol
4/6/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: We already complained about this in the tutor hour
4/6/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm gonna do it for an arbitrary size of n, but passively say that this is some bullshit right here
4/6/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: but he didn't really care
4/6/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its the worst
4/6/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/6/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fuck, sorry Job, wrong chat
4/6/17, 11:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok serious question  ..  i am at vujpers office again... noone ?

4/6/17, 11:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: No lights
4/6/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hmmm
4/6/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: have you mailed the supervisor?
4/6/17, 11:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: When you lunch breaks start here ??!?!?
4/6/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: he's there for sure on friday at 11:30
4/6/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: perhaps you should have sent him an email before you went there?
4/6/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: like; he has stuff to do all day probably besides just sitting at his desk, so maybe you should have asked at what times he was available to hand in the stuff?
4/6/17, 12:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sure

4/6/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ohh okay
4/6/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: so now you hand in the boxes instead of the key
4/6/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Our tutor told us we could leave the box in U5 actually, but maybe he will bring it to Pieter himself or something
4/6/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: oh well than that should be fine
4/6/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: We are handing in the boxes and 2 paper copies of our reports tomorrow to our tutor
4/6/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: why paper copies?
4/6/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: thats a waste of money and paper son

4/6/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: he's pretty old, so I suppose it's some nostalgia
4/6/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: to the good ol' non-digital days

4/6/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but will on others?
4/6/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It might be that the network blocks the vpn port
4/6/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because the settings on that network don't allow you to do so prolly?
4/6/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: why
4/6/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz like
4/6/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its a BnB
4/6/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i met the owner
4/6/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: im like 500% sure he doesnt even know how to access his router settings
4/6/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: My mother doesn't even know what a router is but my father ( and I ) do so maybe het son or husband do know how to block it
4/6/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: His wife*
4/6/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: why would they
4/6/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: goddamnit
4/6/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i just wanna stream ziggo stuff but thats impossible without a dutch vpn
4/6/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: The Tue vpn is only partial
4/6/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Try another free vpn app and see if it works
4/6/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: anything you can reccommend?
4/6/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Tunnel bear
4/6/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Has a small trial version but enough to test if that is the problem
4/6/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Dont spam please🌚
4/6/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: But I have my own vpn on my home network so Idk any others
4/6/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yeah I'll shut up
4/6/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: sete up your own VPN :^)
4/6/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hmm
4/6/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: that seems legit
4/6/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: im gonna do that after the finals i think
4/6/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: setting one up at home is useless though
4/6/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: seeing as rewiring your internet through your home network makes your network still link to you and or your family members
4/6/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: how do you even do that
4/6/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but that kinda depends on its purpose right storm?
4/6/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yeah well it's slows you down if your home network is not fast enough
4/6/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: it's only useful is you want to visit the web when you can connect to the netherlands but not austalia for example
4/6/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Anyone with answers to Exam 2009 and 2012 of Data Structures
4/6/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: ?
4/6/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I did some stuff in my head for 2012
4/6/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But no answer sheet though
4/6/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Why do we need to hand in modeling as a .zip file ??
4/6/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ?
4/6/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: what lmao
4/6/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: i don't think they care if it's a zip or multiple attachments
4/6/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But what is the second attachment? Cuz we just put in the Accel code in our final project
4/6/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: they need to be able to run your code
4/6/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: they aren't going to copy and paste all that bullshit
4/6/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: especially when it's in pdf format
4/6/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So how to do it then?
4/6/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: hand in the pdf and a txt file with the source
4/6/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: or replace the txt with an accel executable
4/6/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: if it has those
4/6/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So, they are not going to copy everthing out of a pdf, but they are going to copy everything out of a txt file?
4/6/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Isnt the source dependant of the local pc
4/6/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Or if I send my link
4/6/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: well i don't know about accel but most languages have a common format for code
4/6/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: They will get all my code ?
4/6/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: accel is an emulator
4/6/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: so it isn't pc dependant
4/6/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I just tried it, doesnt work like that, I cant just send my link to someone and they'll have my code
4/6/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Tom, i don't use accel, but doesn't it have something like a .java file for java or .h and .c for C?
4/6/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Our tutor made us use Accel, its fucking dumb
4/6/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: it must have some sort of file format
4/6/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: how are you going to save and share otherwise
4/6/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We just put it in a txt file and hand that in
4/6/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: rubben save me
4/6/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They can just copy that into the IO/edit tab and run the script
4/6/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah thats what we need
4/6/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: The official Accel Tutorial said
4/6/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: How do I save a script to an external file?
Building a model can easily take several hours of work. It is essential that you frequently save your work, both to protect you against mistakes and to safeguard you against (rare) fatal errors in ACCEL. Saving a script into an external file works as follows:

    Go to the "IO / Edit" tab;
    click somewhere inside the text area, where your scipt is, to get the focus;
    select all text by typing ctrl-a (Windows) or cmd-a (Mac). All text will be highlighted;
    copy all text by typing ctrl-c (Windows) or cmd-c (Mac);
    open a new text file using some plain ascii-editor (e.g., notepad on Windows or textedit on Mac. Preferably don't use MS Word as this may put additional characters into your text);
    paste the text into a blank page in the editor by typing ctrl-v (Windows) or cmd-v (Mac);
    verify that all of the text of your script has appeared in the text editor;
    save your text file for later retrieval.
4/6/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks for this tutorial
4/6/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Really helped
4/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Kek
4/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Never knew I could copy everything with cntrl+c
4/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: well its both retarded and not retarded at the same time
4/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's a hidden feature
4/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Its 100% retarted
4/6/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: occupying another standard just for accel would be stupid and all java and c source files are just glorified txt files
4/6/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Where is the office hour for DS?
4/6/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: mf 15 right? Seventh floor I think
4/6/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Alright thought it might be somewhere bigger

4/6/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: data structures probably
4/6/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you can see it as a question hour
4/6/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Thanx max

4/6/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Can't ask questions if you don't know what it's about ey
4/6/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He's know what's its about that's the problem
4/6/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ayyy

4/6/17, 19:07 - Bas Gieling: anne gave the actual answer on how to solve it on cs-students
4/6/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: your answer is very likely (1,2)
4/6/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: bc from what i heard its always basically the opposite of what you get
4/6/17, 19:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I will check it out as well! Thanks

4/7/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: Data structures exam from 2012, Question 5: Can somebody give me a hint on how to create the algorithm in O(log n ) time?
4/7/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: It's about finding the median of 2n elements, distributed over two sorted arrays, each containing n elements
4/7/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Binary search I would say, haven't don't it my self though
4/7/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: When do you get log n?
4/7/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: When you divide an array in half recursively right?
4/7/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ye
4/7/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: We won the european overleaf contest

4/7/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: K
4/7/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you do that, then solve the last 4 elements by taking the maximum of the first of each array added to the minimum of the second array and divide that by 2
4/7/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You need to find the floor of the median of both arrays and then compare them with each other. You'll get 2 recursive calls on the function.
4/7/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Just 2 recursive calls I mean
4/7/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Arthur said we wont get such a question since it came out of the assignments that year.
4/7/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: Great!
4/7/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Best thing you can do for DS I think is just do the two exams and then you'll know which 'basic' exercises will always be on there and then just repeat the assignments.

4/7/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or (4,6)

4/7/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: wtf i copied an answer from the practice exercises cause i got the exact same question and its wrong

4/7/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: (We have included our sourcecode, so the rest of the file is about 50 pages)
4/7/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: a bit too late to ask now ey

4/7/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: anything more than 15 pages is probably fine
4/7/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Doesn't matter. Just make sure you included all the rubrics from the judge table thing where your grade if based on
4/7/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: we have 55 without source it seems
4/7/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 50988766‬: More so as an indication if we are way short or have too many pages
4/7/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Thanks =)
4/7/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If I were to include source we'd be over 100 pages lol
4/7/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 👆🏻 same
4/7/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: the tutor told us to keep it short and clear tho
4/7/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Little over 80 pages without source
4/7/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: so we have 30 pages
4/7/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Nobody wants to read 100 pages full with useless information
4/7/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: we have 35 pages or sth
4/7/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: we've got 29
4/7/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: I checked we have 87 pages
4/7/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We have around 40 pages but some pages are just 1 image that we couldn't make smaller because of details

4/7/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We just have to email our shit
4/7/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: the printed version without appendices i hope? ;p
4/7/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I don't think he'd want printed code :p
4/7/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: because that's a lot
4/7/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah our code is 1200+ lines so I'm not gonna print it
4/7/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am still amazed by this, because  your machine is not much more complex than ours, and ours only has 650-ish lines of code

4/7/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: fill in x=3 and y=8 into the function
4/7/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: then you get 72
4/7/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: so it would be ... -(z-72)
4/7/17, 12:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh my god i cant count 😐

4/7/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: because every "node" has 4 of these children

4/7/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: isnt it because the lowest level of the ree has n "nodes" that each have that +n?

4/7/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: my guess was because the amount of children is 2^2 at the first pic and at the second pic its 2^1
4/7/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I explained it on cs students
4/7/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: At questions
4/7/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ow wait
4/7/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Nvm
4/7/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Well each level has has a cost. Zeroth level has cost n, first level cost 2n etc. As you can see the cost per level 2^(i)*n. The recursion stops when the subproblems are of size 1. The subproblems follow the recursion by n/(2^i) as you can see. When setting n/(2^i)=1 we find that the recursion has depth of i=log(n). Since we want to know the cost of the last level we only have to filll this i into the cost per level formula. 2^(i)*n with i=log(n) gives n^2
4/7/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: thanks a lot!

4/7/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: So, its probably the 4th then
4/7/17, 20:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Last year it was Thursday the 1st when we had to get our books, the lectures will start on a monday
4/7/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: Guess what, the 4th is a Monday
4/7/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Didn't think of that, since it's Friday the 1st

4/8/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: question:
4/8/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if asked a question you have to solve with the pidgeon principle
4/8/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is it enough to just say "by the pigeon hole principle..."
4/8/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yes
4/8/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or do you have to actually show how to use it
4/8/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: no, but you still need to explainm why it's relevant
4/8/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: could you show me in what amount of detail you need to do this? Idk how deep to go into it
4/8/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: ...there are n+1 things and n holes that need to be filled, then by the pigeonhole principle at least one hole has to have 2 things in it and therefore...
4/8/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: let's, for example, take the question for the assignment
4/8/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: U > mn
4/8/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: show that theres a container with at least n distinct elements
4/8/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how would you solve that?
4/8/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: we have m containers and U distinct elements I suppose?
4/8/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yes
4/8/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no
4/8/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: U is the universe of elements i belive
4/8/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and n distinct elements
4/8/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or smth
4/8/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wait lemme check
4/8/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: different and distinct are very different definitions btw
4/8/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah i know
4/8/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: they are very distinct definition
4/8/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: s
4/8/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what
4/8/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How would you go about proving it again?
4/8/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: using the pidgeon hole principle
4/8/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but idk how far you need to go into detail
4/8/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: if we have U > m*n elements and m slots to fill, then the pigeonhole principle applies and we have at least one slot with n elements in it. (BONUS INFORMATION YEAH!>)if this was not the case and all m slots would have less than n elements in it we would have less than m*n elements in total which is a contradtiction,
4/8/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: the second part with bonus information is imo not necessary but adding it took 40 seconds
4/8/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
4/8/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: sounds good
4/8/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks bae
4/8/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: np complete
4/8/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I think you should mention which thing is the container, and which are the items to go in those containers
4/8/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so.. m is the amount of containers, and U elements need to go in
4/8/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: smth like that?
4/8/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and then say that since theres at least n times as many elements as there are containers, by the pidgeon hole principle there has to be at least one container with at least n different elements
4/8/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or something like that
4/8/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: yeah and then do what @31629323398 did above
4/8/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: or sth in that direction
4/8/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah alright
4/8/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: seems good

4/8/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Was Computational Science in there?
4/8/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: most important question
4/8/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: @31623080897 , you made a pretty big mistake in question 2a of the 2012 quiz, because searching can be done in O(log n) time in a *sorted* array as well because binary search
4/8/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Should be insertion/deletion
4/8/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, idk if it was mentioned already
4/8/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also @31623080897 , your answer to 2b is incorrect as well, since it's an array and not a list
4/8/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: also, your algorithm in Q5 of 2009 does not work
4/8/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I tried manually simulating the algorithm on an array of 9 elements, and it doesnt sort the array at all.
4/8/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Tell me about it max
4/8/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31623080897

4/8/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it does work
4/8/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the t = t + 1 is in the if loop
4/8/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i didnt see that
4/8/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nvm it does work

4/8/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: so yeah
4/8/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31623080897 your algorithm at Q5 from 2009 is incorrect
4/8/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you need to change i=1 in the for loop to i=0, and change the A[t+1] in the swap to A[t]
4/8/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: then its correct
4/8/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: tested it in java

4/8/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk why you did that shit because its the most illogical thing ever
4/8/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Arrays in pseudocode start at 1
4/8/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Arrays in java start at 0
4/8/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: The algorithm is correct
4/8/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: then he should make the t=0 at the start into t=1
4/8/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and change A[t+1] to A[t]

4/8/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we are saying exactly the same
4/8/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you say "just add 1 to every t" and I say "let the value of t start 1 bigger"
4/8/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: which means
4/8/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that we are saying the same
4/8/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: just implementing if differently
4/8/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
4/8/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Its indeed correct if arrays in pseudocode start at 1
4/8/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yeah in lectures and stuff they do start at 1
4/8/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

4/8/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: @31623080897 your answer for 2012 question 2 is wrong ;) Insertion / deletion cost Theta(n) time in a sorted array and are not in Theta(1). You could use insertion for an operation that is faster in an RB-tree (theta(logn) over theta(n)) and find-max for an operation that is faster in an sorted array (theta(1) over theta(logn))
4/8/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: tru
4/8/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: @31643222030 , is there any overleaf-like functionality in cs-students.nl?
4/8/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep if you make a shared space you can use a latex block ;)
4/8/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm, lemme see
4/8/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Can't we just create for every question of the tests a question in the 2IL50 space
4/8/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then people can upvote the best answers
4/8/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I think the easiest way to do that would be to create some seperate exam space for 2IL50, invite all other students that want to collaborate and make latex blocks for every question
4/8/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, cs-students.nl wizard, do your thing :P
4/8/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because I am not really sure how to do that
4/8/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Pleasee
4/8/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll look into it in a few hours am busy rn
4/8/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, another question for the cs-students.nl team: how are you doing money-wise?
4/8/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Like, are you able to cover the hosting costs by the donations, or do you need some more?
4/8/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You need to ask @31623837581 about that
4/8/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He's our financial guy
4/8/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: @31623837581
4/8/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: So far so good
4/8/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: We will always take donations, but I care more about people using it than it being financially stable
4/8/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: This is a very important Question
4/8/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes, you need to
4/8/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: With the master theorem you don't need to supply a further proof, with a recursion tree you have to supply additional proof
4/8/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (In the form of induction, that is)
4/8/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, or by using a standard recurrence, that's also possible
4/8/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: you mean a sum notation?
4/8/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah
4/8/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sec, lemme get an example
4/8/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: They dont ask you to proof it
4/8/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: They only want you to solve it
4/8/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There are 3 standard runtime thingies which you should know

4/8/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay, thanks

4/8/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: here are all the answers people
4/8/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: explained really well, done by several tutors
4/8/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I can't watch the suffering any longer
4/8/17, 13:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 👴🏿🙏🏿
4/8/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: they are trustworthy answers, some are even from official answers
4/8/17, 13:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thank god 🙏🏿👴🏿
4/8/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Jeah But What i mean is
4/8/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You have this Sum
4/8/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And that is in theta n^3
4/8/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Do you still need to prove the theta?
4/8/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I saw answers by Abdel, and if that is the Abdel I think it is, this is some legit stuff
4/8/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Cuz its a standard sum
4/8/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Maybe upload it to cs students so answers can be found at te same place
4/8/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm, I don't think so
4/8/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Will do

4/8/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes, it is him
4/8/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Guys, this is legit
4/8/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: @31623837581 /@31643222030 , can one of you guys make folders for the answers?
4/8/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: answers are all in image format so it's not that useful
4/8/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Storm, how the fuck do you get all this stuff tho\
4/8/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is there some secret Zeeland bolussen-for-homework-gang or something?
4/8/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You need to have contacts everywhere
4/8/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: could you elaborate a bit on exactly what you mean by that?
4/8/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, just a folder "Answers exam 2012" like the finished exercises one
4/8/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: ah
4/8/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: sure
4/8/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (And then also one for 2009, but I am assuming you aren not stupid)
4/8/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: actually, you seem to have good ideas about the site, wanna join the team? It would make it easier to push these kinds of changes faster if we have more people
4/8/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm
4/8/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sure
4/8/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because stuff has to be moved around if it is extracted
4/8/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: reordering of the array
4/8/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And in the worst case, the entire array has to be reordered
4/8/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: but in a sorted array the largest element is always at the end. so then there is no need to move around elements isn't it?
4/8/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is not always
4/8/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: If you delete the first element in an array all the other remaining elements have to be moved
4/8/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It does not say anything about the way the array is sorted, only that it is
4/8/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You can have a min or a max heap
4/8/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Same with an array
4/8/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: aha
4/8/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Guys, exercise 5 of Exam 2009, they ask for an algorithm. However, it was not required to learn the actual pseudocode by heart right? So is it enough to state you can use QuickSort, and also elaborate why?
4/8/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: yes
4/8/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: though using partition also works if you modify it slightly (and can argue why it does not influence running time+correctness)
4/8/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: *it works in this specific case
4/8/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: How did you do that then?
4/8/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Do you have a picture or something :)?
4/8/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: let me type it out because you might not be able to read my handwriting xd
4/8/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hahahahaha alright thanks alot
4/8/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh and I meant 'Countingsort' huh
4/8/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Tom there is a zip with all answers above if you didn't know yet
4/8/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I know there are some answers on cs-students, but the one for 5 includes an algorithm in pseudocode, which I thought we did not need to know by heart
4/8/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: They are not lackluster ones done by fellow first years
4/8/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: However, just by using your brain you could come up with an algorithm
4/8/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Just wanted to know if it was fine without
4/8/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it only works because we know there are only 0s and 1s
4/8/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah alright, thanks !
4/8/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: How do you disable to get all these emails from cs students
4/8/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: I already checked the email settings
4/8/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I still recommend you look at the zip tho, as those are definitly correct whereas this one might still be wrong
4/8/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'd like to refer you to the homepage on cs-students.nl Especially the section with the title "Disable Emails"
4/8/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Oke will check it thanks!
4/8/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: pn
4/8/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: for lists or arrays, is it possible to get the length/size of them in constant time?
4/8/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i believe it is yeah
4/8/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: ah ty
4/8/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: See page 21 in the book
4/8/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Damn son
4/8/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Anne got this stuff memorized by heart
4/8/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: She just quote the page of the book on the exam, " for justification see page x of the book"
4/8/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Anne EXPOSED
4/8/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: #Rekt
4/8/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: nah. refer to the lectures instead as that is what they expect you to know. For example when augmenting something you can refer back to the augmentation theorem stated in the slides
4/8/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Or theorem 14.1 in the book
4/8/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Only because I pointed that page out to someone before somewhere in this chat
4/8/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for exam 2009 3c, is it enough to just say that, after I show that it is a sum and that this leads to Theta(n³), I just say that it is the case, or do I also need to proof the bounds? the c1*g( n) <= f( n) <= c2*g*( n) thing, because I don't reallly remember what I have to pick for f( n) here
4/8/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: One the canvas there is an explanation
4/8/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: the one thomas just send you mean?
4/8/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Modules > Recursion 2 > question 3
4/8/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you're missing the 2nd half of the answer @31631763035
4/8/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: No a different one
4/8/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: They say hey is a regular recurrence and they have a picture
4/8/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: But that one is "official" since it is made by the lecturers
4/8/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I can only find recursion, not recursion 2
4/8/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Lemme check
4/8/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: oh nvm, found it
4/8/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: didn't notice you meant practice 2
4/8/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: in there they don't prove the bounds either
4/8/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so we don't need to do that either on the exam then?
4/8/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: I dont know but you always have an argument in case they say your answer is wrong
4/8/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: also, does anyone have an answer that explains it better than the one on cs-students, for Q4 of 2009?
4/8/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: because I still don't understand it
4/8/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Fucking hell, the median question in 2012 is complete magic to me
4/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the algorithm
4/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what the fuk
4/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That one was from the homework in that year
4/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: max.
4/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: if u think the questions are fucking weird
4/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: they are from past assignments
4/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: so dw
4/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Divide 'n conquer, then a simple formula for the last 4 elements
4/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: focus on the basic questions + our assignments
4/8/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright seems good
4/8/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks for the advice john bby
4/8/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys
4/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes M'am

4/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and
4/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: n = 2^k - 1 with k is the number of levels
4/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what the fuck
4/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: my guess was draw a tree with 7 nodes
4/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That is only for B7
4/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is it
4/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You don't need to take that into account for A7
4/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: A7 is just straight down
4/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: holy shit this question is so badly formulated
4/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: holy fuck
4/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this is the worst
4/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ye right?
4/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the worst ive ever seen
4/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: ignore the vague k thing. it's their way of explaining what a completely filled search tree is
4/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 7 nodes all on the right side
4/8/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: o

4/8/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I don't know, but the answers from Abdel say mine is legit
4/8/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Well, Abdel is a liar then
4/8/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: no shit.
4/8/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: LOOK AT THE QUESTION
4/8/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT
4/8/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ITS THE WORST
4/8/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ITS ABSOLUTELY THE WORST
4/8/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: HOW THE FUCK ARE WE SUPPOSED TO MAKE A TREE THAT IS COMPLETELY FILLED
4/8/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: IF WE CANT USE LEFT CHILDREN
4/8/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: WHAT THE FUCK
4/8/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: STOP SPAMMING

4/8/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: AT WHOM?
4/8/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ASFGVD:HKLSDYUFHKJBGDSUH]
4/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no sorry guys
4/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but
4/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: does anyone actually see how this is possible?
4/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because
4/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i dont
4/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31610720282 help us
4/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31627446682 youre good with ds too
4/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: help
4/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: what question are u wondering about
4/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: scroll
4/8/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: up
4/8/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: u just wanna know how to draw them
4/8/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Just 7 nodes straight down
4/8/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: where they all are the right child
4/8/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but then
4/8/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: n = 2^k-1 doesnt hold
4/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That's only for the B
4/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: the k levels of B
4/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: A and (B with ....)
4/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: did you even read what was said before i started screaming
4/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: THE K LEVELS OF B WHERE DO U SEE AN A
4/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: why does the question say "each" then
4/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: DO U WANT ME TO SCREAM
4/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: DUDR
4/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: because it is general
4/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: but then u only take into account for b
4/8/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no
4/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: because in a ur not making a full tree
4/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what the fuck
4/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: yes fuck me daddy i know that they formulate questions in a bad way have u seen our past assignments
4/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: x and y consist of 5 elements each.
4/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: THAT "EACH" AFTER THE SENTENCE IMPLIES THAT THE CLAIM HOLDS FOR BOTH
4/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: FUCK ME THESE PEOPLE NEED TO LEARN ENGLISH
4/8/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: WHAT THE FUCK MAN
4/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm so ashamed for our uni rn
4/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: holy shit
4/8/17, 16:19 - Bas Gieling: maybe the nodes can have 2 right children
4/8/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: LOL
4/8/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i think ive never been angrier at a course than i am angry at ds
4/8/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this is such a shit course
4/8/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: holy shit
4/8/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: It doesn't say anything about the height of tree A, just for tree B
4/8/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: It still has the same amount of nodes, but they are structured diffrently, as A is a path and B is *complete* binary search tree
4/8/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what is k for n = 2^k-1 then?
4/8/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: right
4/8/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: log base 2 of 6
4/8/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And you did Computer Systems?
4/8/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so theres log_2(6) layers
4/8/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: right..
4/8/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: yeah, taht equals to about 3 layers
4/8/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: it just says that number of nodes can be described by the form 2^k -1, where k is a natural number. in this case 7 = 2^3 -1, and thus can be described in that form
4/8/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The question is indeed pretty vaguely formulated
4/8/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
4/8/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wait
4/8/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i think i get it
4/8/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: for B, k is the amount of layers
4/8/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but thats not the case for A
4/8/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: No, but k is not specified in A at all
4/8/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no okay
4/8/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i get it now
4/8/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: damn
4/8/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Yeah
4/8/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this question is so shit
4/8/17, 16:23 - Bas Gieling: good job max
4/8/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i still stand by my claim that its the worst formulated question ever
4/8/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and im still angry at it
4/8/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Oh and btw, it would be log_2(8) by adding the 1 instead of subtracting it
4/8/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol yeah i noticed
4/8/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck this im done for today
4/8/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i cant take any more
4/8/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Haha, glad it's cleared up now :D
4/8/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: You'll be fine
4/8/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I hope they learned how to speak english between 2012 and now
4/8/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Nol
4/8/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is that... modeling?
4/8/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: yeah
4/8/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: youre my hero
4/8/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: just thought it might be handy
4/8/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: its just directly from the lecture notes lol not an actual summary
4/8/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: @31621372984 do you have a good summary for CG maybe?
4/8/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nah dude
4/8/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: How can you calculate 3b of 2012 without calculator.
4/8/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: By not giving the exact e
4/8/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: How do you get net the exact e
4/8/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: not
4/8/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: say 0 < e = 1/100000000000000000
4/8/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Just say Some e > 0?
4/8/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: You can just say something like "log(2, 5) is larger than two so we need to subtract an e to reach 2" right?
4/8/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: you can, just say it is greater than 2 because log(4) is 2 and 4 is greater than 5
4/8/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: oh, i thought you say you cant, lol, but yea you can say that just fine
4/8/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 4 > 5 ~ @31650858649
4/8/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: mmmm
4/8/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: not my smartest moment
4/8/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: is the answer of 2009Q4 right on cs-student?
4/8/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: since I have no clue
4/8/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yeah
4/8/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: it says that for n < 100 Insertionsort is faster than Mergesort
4/8/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: and since mergesort is n log(n)
4/8/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Insertionsort is faster than that
4/8/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: whenever n gets bigger than 100
4/8/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: it will get to mergesort which will take n log(n)
4/8/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: then that is the worst case
4/8/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: hmm okay thanks
4/8/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: just the way it is formulated is kinda weird, and confusing for me as well, but that is much more clear, thanks sander
4/8/17, 18:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 👍🏻
4/8/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wauw i have No clue What that is
4/8/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Well the distance becomes different
4/8/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But the same keys still follow the same path
4/8/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But 3 and 4 might address to the the same slot, but the next slot for 3 will be different from the next slot of 4
4/8/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Keys might test the same slot at different points in their probe sequence, i.e. i=2 and i=4, then the step they make after that is different and thus they do not follow the same probe sequence
4/8/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: ahh alright
4/8/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: but double chaining is the way to go right
4/8/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: double hashing*
4/8/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You guys are talking about things that scare me
4/8/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If you don't want clustering
4/8/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yeah okay thanks
4/8/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
4/8/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Consider reading more about hashing with open addressing
4/8/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: After this replenishing dinner I'll try to get as far as I can!
4/8/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Exactly this
4/8/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31643470096
4/8/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ehm Well no
4/8/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: do they mean with a sorted list a sorted linked list? otherwise i dont know the difference between a sorted list and a sorted array
4/8/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I think sorted array as a sorted linked list was never covered
4/8/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: (Linked) list works with pointers to get from one element to another, an array just has indices.
4/8/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: For that one you should just remember Theta n³
4/8/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: sum of (n-i) ^2 = sum of i^2 and that one has a standard outcome of theta (n^3)
4/8/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: it would be easier to remember if i can figure out the summation formula
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: How can you do the small 3 as power?
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Alt + 3
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Without having ^
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ³
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ah
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: same for Alt+2=²
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Also possible on phone?
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: no clue, sorry
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: n
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ah okay
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Thanks
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Alt Gr btw
4/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I have a google pinyin keyboard on my phone, the english part of that keyboard has it
4/8/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
4/8/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Mine does not have it...
4/8/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: OMG I AM IN ANNES PHONE I AM HONOURED
4/8/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Woah
4/8/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: /spam
4/8/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: rip me
4/8/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: That's useful
4/8/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You can download it in the play store
4/8/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: *Cries in iOS
4/8/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It doesn't work on pc
4/8/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (But Anne, most of us don't need a pinjin keyboard)
4/8/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: using Alt Gr, not normal Alt?
4/8/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I know, but it is English and Pinyin, maybe there is a Dutch version too
4/8/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: ¡²³¤€¼½¾‘
4/8/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oehh
4/8/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: wait, you didn't know you could do that?
4/8/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: if you didn't learn anything from DS, then at least you learned something new today
4/8/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gboard-a-new-keyboard-from-google/id1091700242?mt=8 this might work for iOS
4/8/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: It doesnt have that functionality on iOS apparently
4/8/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But scikey does work
4/8/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: ∛ ⁶
4/8/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: ^^
4/8/17, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Or just jailbreak your iphone and add a custom keyboard ;)
4/8/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sem, rustig aan met je gehack
4/8/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: @31642007885 is watching
4/8/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Custom keyboards are allowed in iOS without jailbreak

4/8/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I know but the jailbreak ones have a lot more functions most of the time ;D
4/8/17, 23:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Guys, I made an example exam that uses questions from our assignment, as well as some basic questions from the other 2 exams. An answer sheet is included, (mistakes might be present) https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/%5B2IL50%5D+Data+Structures
4/8/17, 23:02 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Jort you hero
4/8/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Careful with this though, it makes your phone quit vulnerable if you don't change the Root's password 😬
4/8/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If you install ssh yes
4/8/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: True
4/8/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Doesn't it do this automatically ?
4/8/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Not anymore afaik
4/8/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah than it's fixed probably
4/8/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Long time ago I learned this, these security flaws get patchef and Fount by the minute tbh
4/8/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Though the standard password isn't one that used a lot as well so they have to specifically look for jailbroken iphones
4/8/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: What do you mean ?
4/8/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well alpine isn't a password you see alot
4/8/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We should move this confo to the spam chat btw
4/8/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: True
4/8/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nice work!
4/8/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: thanks, if you spot any mistakes/typos let me know and I'll upload a new version
4/8/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: @31623837581 third subquestion of question 1 should be sum of i^2 not n^2 but thats just a notation issue
4/8/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: thanks, small typo there
4/8/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: @31623837581 Im not sure, but how is it that 9b requires *running times* to express space efficiency?
4/8/17, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: It often involves typos and a lack of caffeine :P
4/8/17, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: That explanation suffices 😁
4/8/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: Thanks for the effort by the way, really appreciate it!
4/8/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, people are being mvp
4/9/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Did arrays etc start at [0] or [1] in DS
4/9/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Forgot
4/9/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: 1
4/9/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Oh damn
4/9/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Did that wrong in all the assignments I think
4/9/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But it makes sense when looking at the kth node stuff
4/9/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh lol
4/9/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I did that wrong as well
4/9/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Every time
4/9/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Hash table starts at 0 though
4/9/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: YEY
4/9/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah to keep things easy
4/9/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Here we go with the inconsistencies
4/9/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And make sure no confusion happens
4/9/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: guys do we need books for HTI/USE/automata and process theory?
4/9/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
4/9/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: especially when you look at the answers
4/9/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
4/9/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: points don't really matter for that thing anyway
4/9/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I tried to do a consistent point allocation thing, but in the end I was like, fuck it it ain't adding up
4/9/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: Is it bad if you forgot to make this weeks modelling test? Except for my grade ofc
4/9/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you wont be able to take the exam
4/9/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is that true..?
4/9/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Yes, you should have submitted
4/9/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: rip
4/9/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: didn't you guys realise you had to do it?
4/9/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Mail them @31636419661 , they won't let you down I think
4/9/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: okay thanks guys, brb crying over my stupidity
4/9/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because you couldv'e submitted an empty thing which is basically what you did
4/9/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait what
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We didn't have to submit anything for the weeklies
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It was just doing the exercises and getting green checks
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: You didn't submit anything?
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Did you actually have to press 'submit'?
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: pranked
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And I got 100% everywhere
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: There wasn't a submit button for me
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Didn't submit a thing
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Same here Johan
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pfew
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I did the weekly tests
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Love this panic
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: FUCK YOU HAN :p
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but I don't think they do anything if you don't make them
4/9/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: im such a terrible person lol
4/9/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes, yes you are
4/9/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: @31636419661 nothings wrong im sorry
4/9/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: @31636419661 people are jerks please uncry your tears
4/9/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: You were the only person I knew for sure was fucking with me
4/9/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: meh
4/9/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: meanies
4/9/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: love my reputation

4/9/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: @31642623926 😏😏
4/9/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: useful information
4/9/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 😂😂😂😂😂
4/9/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: ...
4/9/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait is this a way of giving yourself points on the website?
4/9/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: LOOPHOLE
4/9/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: Man, what series is that a reference to again?!
4/9/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: <Media omitted>
4/9/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Wrong!
4/9/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: chris could be right
4/9/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Bob too
4/9/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: I would say only Bob is right
4/9/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Why leon?
4/9/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: nope, Chris too
4/9/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Chris is also right. The O👎 is for sufficiently large n, so for k = 5 it might be 0.1 k²
4/9/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: O( n) dammit
4/9/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Okay
4/9/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
4/9/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
4/9/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 3T(n/2) + O(n^2)
4/9/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: nvm i see it already, i thought the calls to weirdalgo where in the for loop as well.
4/9/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: yeah that should be it
4/9/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: thanks
4/9/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wait, aren't they?
4/9/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ahh, now I see as well
4/9/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: nope
4/9/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I was hella confused about that question as well
4/9/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But it is just screwed up indenting
4/9/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I can imagine they got quite some complaints about that question tho
4/9/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Don't forget te base case
4/9/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: the*
4/9/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: What would they want to see for a base case?
4/9/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You give a recurrence, that needs a base case, for example T(1)
4/9/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Sometimes more: T(2), T(3) etc.
4/9/17, 18:16 - Bas Gieling: yea
4/9/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: oh so in this case T(1) = 1
4/9/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: ?
4/9/17, 18:26 - Bart van Dooren: T(1)=42 I thought
4/9/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Since you do constant work when n=1
4/9/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: T(1) would be 42 when you are trying to do proof by induction
4/9/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Yes
4/9/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Rather write Θ(1) instead of just 1 then
4/9/17, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Hmm good one
4/9/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: Where do we have to be tomorrow?
4/9/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: paviljoen studyhub 2
4/9/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Depends which train you're going to delay 🙊
4/9/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: paviljoen study hub 2
4/9/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: Aight thanks
4/9/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: lol savage
4/9/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is this also for Web Science
4/9/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Look at mytimetable.tue.nl
4/9/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If I would pay you for every tip I'd be broke
4/9/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thank you
4/9/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: What info was shared at the extra lecture
4/9/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I forgot what I don't have to learn
4/9/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: there is an audio recording on cs-students.nl
4/9/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I need to know which lecture it was
4/9/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and listening to them all would mean missing the exam
4/9/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it isn't recorded and there were no slides
4/9/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I think it was range searching
4/9/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: oh nice
4/9/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: all I can do is provide you with my audio recording
4/9/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: or answer your questions on cs-students.nl
4/9/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: nah it's alright
4/9/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: answer your questions... right :D
4/9/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: let's just pray for no range searching
4/9/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You don't need to know anything about the range searching lecture
4/9/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: https://cs-students.nl/questions?&filter=unanswered
4/9/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: The graph quetions are always 5 points right
4/9/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: You probably mean *ask* your questions, instead of *answer* :)
4/9/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: noice
4/9/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I was talking about how I can help him, as in I can answer his qustions
4/9/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: oh, now i get the coherence of those two sentences. Never mind :D
4/9/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: :P
4/9/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31610720282 , you think you'll be able to ace the exam? (aka get a 10)
4/9/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Probably not a 10, but I will try to finish DS with a 9 or 10 average
4/9/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: <Media omitted>
4/9/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oeh oeh I know that
4/9/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Look at the proof for inorder treewalk runtime in the book
4/9/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: there is an assignment question about the same thing but there we had to count the values of every childnode in the parent and so on
4/9/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That was exactly the same proof for runtime I guess
4/9/17, 20:46 - Luke Houben: Where do we have to be for DS tomorrow?
4/9/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Study hub 2
4/9/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Paviljoen study hub
4/9/17, 20:47 - Luke Houben: Alright thanks! Did we get a mail about this? Can't seem to find it
4/9/17, 20:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Vak a to f
4/9/17, 20:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think people with extra time go to some other place but make sure to check your mails
4/9/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah
4/9/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: mytimetable.tue.nl, as Anne provided me
4/9/17, 20:50 - Luke Houben: Ah pretty obvious lol
4/9/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 34184455‬: It's also on the homepage for datastructures on canvas
4/9/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It has also been mentioned several times through the day, but stress gets to us ey ;)
4/9/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So I'll just keep sharing
4/9/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: https://cs-students.nl/questions/14288674
4/9/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Answering your own questions again I see
4/9/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 😊
4/9/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😋
4/9/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I remember last time we sat there thinking. Wasn't that at Fundamentals?
4/9/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or was it LST
4/9/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No it was Funda
4/9/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I believe I even asked you some shit I didn't know and I scored a 5.8
4/9/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So you may have saved my ass
4/9/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: When you use the master theorem do you have to also tell the case or is the rule itself also correct?
4/9/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Always state of he case to be safe
4/9/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For security measures I would state the case indeed
4/9/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: state kees
4/9/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Also, before what date do we have to order books, and which do we need for next quartile(hti for me as choice)
4/9/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: hope i wont confuse myself between case 1 and 3 then
4/9/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 1 is -e, 3 is +e with the additional part to prove
4/9/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: The only thing I am worried about with MT is the approximating how much log.a(b) is
4/9/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: its indeed hard to make a good approximation without calculator
4/9/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Anyone has a good tip for this?
4/9/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you can just say that e=(original-log.a(b))
4/9/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you don't have to calculate it just speculate that it's >0
4/9/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: True, but it might also be that it is +
4/9/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: But it's kinda usefull to know if log.a(b) is larger or smaller than f(n)
4/9/17, 21:12 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: It's mostly n^int and you can easily estimate log.a(b) in integers
4/9/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: If you understand what I mean
4/9/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: "Easily"
4/9/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: True that but my tutor gave minus points because i said that there exist an e>0 so that n ^( loga (b) )-+ e = f (n)
4/9/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i want this smartness And powerfull attitude
4/9/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait we cannot use a calculator? How do they want us to do the log stuff indeed
4/9/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Just check if a² is > or < then b, if < then log.a b is greater then 2
4/9/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wait
4/9/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You have to Give the e?
4/9/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: No not exactly
4/9/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Cant you just say For Some e
4/9/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: An approximation, yes
4/9/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Kk
4/9/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: As long as you show it is greater then 0
4/9/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Than*
4/9/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hmm
4/9/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ffs
4/9/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: But this helps
4/9/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: As mostly it's n2 or smth
4/9/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: n^2
4/9/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: And if it's n³ you just replace the 2's by a 3
4/9/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Yeah, I guess that works
4/9/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Thanks for the tip, I'll definetly use it
4/9/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: No problem
4/9/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
4/9/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/9/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: @31623837581 , you forgot in this proof to add "Since those cases cover all possible possiblities because $reason", we have proven by induction that"
4/9/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Would be nice
4/9/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you're absolutely right, let me fix it right away
4/9/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That can happen haha
4/9/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It just struck me :P
4/9/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 34184455‬: Could someone give some more explanation as to why the worst case running time is theta(n log n)?
4/9/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Insertion Sort is faster For every n <100 compared to merge sort
4/9/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So merge Sort is in this case the "weakest link"
4/9/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But theta only deals with large numbers
4/9/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Indeed
4/9/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So you just day "N0 > 100"
4/9/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And Since For +100 its merge sort
4/9/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And everything is fixed
4/9/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It is the running time of merge Sort
4/9/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah Rick But he wanted to know Why
4/9/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, okay
4/9/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, the "Why" is asymptotic notation in this case
4/9/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 34184455‬: Ah okay, makes sense. Thank you

4/9/17, 22:00 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: yes
4/9/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: REMEMBER PEOPLE I=0
4/9/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I forgot that 100 times
4/9/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and got fucked over badly
4/9/17, 22:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lol
4/9/17, 22:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/9/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is open addressing, since the table is quite full already
4/9/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wait, nevermind
4/9/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Your answer is correct
4/9/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Woohoo :D
4/9/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You gave me confidence to go to sleep
4/9/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: What's the difference again?
4/9/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Between chaining and open addressing
4/9/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Chaining=stacking on the same place in the hash table
4/9/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: open adressing is finding empty spot
4/9/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: @31643470096 has a great parking lot analogy
4/9/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So trying and trying and trying
4/9/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yeah I love the parking lot Stef told me as well
4/9/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Stef, can you show me the analogy
4/9/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Pfff
4/9/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Okay
4/9/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Quickly
4/9/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: :
4/9/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Half empty parking lot -> easy to find spot
4/9/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So open adressing
4/9/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Almost full parking lot -> hard to find parking spot (with open adressing)
4/9/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So you better just drive to the next floor And try there
4/9/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Cuz there is more space So its easier to find And thus faster
4/9/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Which represends chaining ofc
4/9/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Wow that actually is quite a good analogy
4/9/17, 22:07 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Gl tomorrow kids
4/9/17, 22:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Right? 😜
4/9/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Woho
4/9/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: already?
4/9/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: sleep is for the weak!

4/9/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 5 last revises and then done
4/10/17, 07:39 - ‪+31 6 22327208‬: Exam is in paviljoen right?
4/10/17, 07:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Look on cs-students.nl
4/10/17, 07:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Yes
4/10/17, 07:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Please stop referring questions to cs-students
4/10/17, 07:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Questions asked here are urgent, and people who ask them here don't have time often to look on cs-students
4/10/17, 07:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, it was made for a reason, namely to stop people from asking the same question over and over again
4/10/17, 07:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: It's annoying if people just answer questions with "Just see cs-students"
4/10/17, 07:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Well people do know by now don't they?
4/10/17, 07:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Just don't answer it you don't want to answer with a useful answer
4/10/17, 07:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is true though, explanation questions are on csstudents to avoid long repeated discussions here
4/10/17, 07:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exam location is fine here
4/10/17, 07:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You even can take the bus from the station
4/10/17, 07:42 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This is a useful answer, they just have to look it up
4/10/17, 07:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Yeah I was wondering that Anne, do you know what bus we need to have to get to De Lismortel?
4/10/17, 07:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 104
4/10/17, 07:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: To TU/e science park
4/10/17, 07:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Does that actually stop at de lismortel?
4/10/17, 07:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (This isn't on cs-students.nl ;))
4/10/17, 07:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It stops in front of the paviljoen
4/10/17, 07:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or what station do i have to get out at
4/10/17, 07:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh nice
4/10/17, 07:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright thanks rick
4/10/17, 07:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And the bus stop is called "de lismortel" as well
4/10/17, 07:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: noice
4/10/17, 07:46 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Is the test at studiehub?
4/10/17, 07:48 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Also, if someone wanted to know where the exam will be, and they want to look at a website, they could also look at one of the tue provided websites
4/10/17, 07:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: mytimetable.tue.nl
4/10/17, 07:49 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: You can also just give me the answer, but thanks
4/10/17, 07:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So the exam is in paviljoen?
4/10/17, 07:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: studyhub 2
4/10/17, 07:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: exactly
4/10/17, 07:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it takes just as much time to write "studyhub 2" as is takes you to write "cs-students" or "mytimetable.tue.nl"
4/10/17, 07:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sk
4/10/17, 07:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So*

4/10/17, 07:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Now its Done
4/10/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: :p
4/10/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: anyone else got a bunch of emails about DBL embedded systems? I got 4 mails about being signed up for it for 2016 in the 3rd quartile, and I don't know why..
4/10/17, 13:37 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: yes i got the same thing and was wondering what is happening
4/10/17, 13:37 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: tu/e bugs
4/10/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I got 2 mails for 4th quartile

4/10/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: can someone help me with electives? https://cs-students.nl/questions/14288777
4/10/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: That would scare the shit out of me
4/10/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If you took it last quartile it should scare you, unless you had so much fun working with the pp2 you want to repeat it all over again.
4/10/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: 2 full packages i think
4/10/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Not source on it tho
4/10/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If a package has 5 subjects
4/10/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You cant Just choose 3?
4/10/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Most of the time you can right? Maybe there is more info on the planapp of that particlar package, sometimes you have to choose

4/10/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Seems like the halting problem, the problem is saying if a random turing machine halts on a certain input and we have learn that that doesnt exist
4/10/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Can anyone confirm?
4/10/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ehm
4/10/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It looks like it
4/10/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But
4/10/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Im not quite dure What the exact definition was
4/10/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: As far as i would say its not enough
4/10/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: To conclude that
4/10/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah it's the halting problem
4/10/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: BUt in another form
4/10/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But again, i cant really remember the halting problem that Good
4/10/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Essentially you have a machine tells you if the turing machine T will halt on input q
4/10/17, 21:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Can someone remind me how to do entropy
4/10/17, 21:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I know it was pretty simple but i cant temember or find it in slides

4/10/17, 21:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also why is there 0 things about funfadentals in cs students
4/10/17, 21:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Was it not done at that time
4/10/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I guess so
4/10/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Beginning of Q3 it was done

4/10/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: -logp is the same as information
4/10/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: but then + 0.2*2.32
4/10/17, 21:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah thiugh so
4/10/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: +1*3.32
4/10/17, 21:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah
4/10/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: you entropy should be just below 1.17
4/10/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3fxf8CEgz7dR0FzQjY0WEZqNlE
4/10/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: if u look at b

4/10/17, 21:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What about b though ?
4/10/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: more complicated
4/10/17, 21:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I know it gives a hint that a should be around 1.17
4/10/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: too complicated to explain it here, slides are better
4/10/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Here's the link to fundamentals on Canvas as it disappeared: https://canvas.tue.nl/courses/483
4/10/17, 21:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oki
4/10/17, 21:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah i got that ine

4/11/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, that says that every regular language can be represented by a turing machine iirc
4/11/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, the summary still is a thing, ya know :P
4/11/17, 11:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And where is that ya know ?
4/11/17, 11:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Cux i am pretty sure its not in cs stooodents ya know 🌚
4/11/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, I made it pre-cs-students
4/11/17, 11:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah i remember something like that but i dont know how to find it 👴🏿🙏🏿
4/11/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is uploaded!

4/11/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Someone on the physics resit tomorrow ?
4/11/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Moi!
4/11/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: What ya gonna do
4/11/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: For study
4/11/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Do the practice tests I think
4/11/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I uploaded them to cs-students.nl
4/11/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Le me as well
4/11/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Oh

4/11/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: good luck bitches
4/11/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And currently I'm structurally panicking as preparation
4/11/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ty faggot
4/11/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: U at uni max ?
4/11/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah man
4/11/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: guys for USE next quartile: are the "werkcolleges" in groups, do you need to be present?
4/11/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: library
4/11/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Has the problem with USE overlapping with HTI in myTimetable even though Osiris says they don't been fixed yet?
4/11/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: are you registered for 0SAB0A or 0SAB0C?
4/11/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Either you registred for HTI after the official registration date had passed or you did not succesfully register for HTI probably
4/11/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I did it correctly more than a week in advance
4/11/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ik kom over uur ofzo met jouw broek
4/11/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since there was no option to select a timeslot for either course
4/11/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I believe the HDI one is only an introductory lecture
4/11/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: in that week
4/11/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: the schedule pretty much changes every week too
4/11/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: *HTI
4/11/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I suspect that it's due to USE being either Timeslot A or C, but right now in the timetable it displays as both
4/11/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So they'll probably still need to divide us
4/11/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: In osiris at registrations it already displays a group for the USE
4/11/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: jow
4/11/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And for you no overlapping courses in mytimetable?
4/11/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: btw this is only for the group-part. There are course-wide lectures if I'm correct
4/11/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: For me there is no overlap
4/11/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: well fuck
4/11/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Ah wait only first week it's displaying use twice the same time
4/11/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah and for me HTI as well :p
4/11/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I don't have HTI haha
4/11/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: The woman i mailed about use cases error in osiris didnt respond me
4/11/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Look at your registrations page if you see you are registered for 0SAB0A/C
4/11/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I will check it just came to my mind as i left home 😓
4/11/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If you are registered for timeslot A of USE there shouldn't be a problem, they just made a mess with the schedule
4/11/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: the tests I'm registered for 0SAB0A
4/11/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But wait, then HTI is in a timeslot where it should not be if I compare Osiris to the timeTable:p
4/11/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Ask the lecturer?
4/11/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will do if the problem persists
4/11/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Osiris says HTI is timeslot C, which is tuesday morning?
4/11/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but then why is modeling also on Tuesday morning
4/11/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When I'm in 0SAB0A
4/11/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: HTI is suppsoed to be in timeslot C
4/11/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: osiris just as terrible as oase
4/11/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Because 0SAB0 is shown, which includes all the timeslots
4/11/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooooh
4/11/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well fuck them
4/11/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And thank you Anne
4/11/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why don't they actually pay you instead of the people they pay now
4/11/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering you're doing a better informative job than them while not being paid at all
4/11/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: look at what flashy website we get to use for 2ID40: http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/2ID40/
4/11/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: KEK
4/11/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They are the only ones that warn you for this though
4/11/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: that goes against the whole idea of HTI right?
4/11/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: OH the funniest thing is that these are our teachers for the hypermedia website project
4/11/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: These two are gonna judge whether our websites look good
4/11/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Well, in the first assignment we get to chose a hardware of software interface and explain why it's shit. So I can imagine half the people will choose this site, and the other half osiris
4/11/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: oh nice
4/11/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Where can you find what book you need to buy for USE?
4/11/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Anyone knows?
4/11/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You need to print a dictaat I think
4/11/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Only print? Someone said we  needed a book for a test in week2
4/11/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I am just going to leave this link here: https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/%5B0SAB0%5D+USE+basis%3A+Ethics+and+history+of+technology
4/11/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I don't know what this link leads to and am therefore not responsible what you will find there
4/11/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hurray for pirates
4/11/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Thanks!
4/11/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/%5B0SAB0%5D+USE+basis%3A+Ethics+and+history+of+technology
I'm just going to place this here are well because someone ( I can't recall who) shared it in an unknown location
4/11/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: oh shit, does it contain the book we would otherwise have to pay over 50 euro's for? Damn I did not mean to send that, what a shame that the internet is written in ink and I can't remove that link I shared
4/11/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh shit oh shit
4/11/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Now that it is here we better make use of it
4/11/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: to be clear it is this 👆🏻 link I totally did not mean to send
4/11/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what is that for
4/11/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: HTI?
4/11/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Even the link says Ethics and History of technology
4/11/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is that a course?
4/11/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: USE
4/11/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh i see
4/11/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: basics of ethics
4/11/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: :p
4/11/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: how not to be a dick: a beginner's guide
4/11/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's gonna be a problem
4/11/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I also heard that our main teacher for Automata is gonna be the guy who send me away at the start of the very first Fundamentals tutorial
4/11/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: sent*
4/11/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep
4/11/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: LOL
4/11/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That's him hahaha
4/11/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Glorious moment
4/11/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That guy acted like a massive dick.. Were you there in the classroom then?
4/11/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep haha
4/11/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
4/11/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Automata seems like a really fun course though
4/11/17, 13:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 13:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also i cant type in human words
4/11/17, 13:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @anyone papa bless 🙏🏿👴🏿
4/11/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I think Bob and Chris are right
4/11/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Alice is definitely wrong
4/11/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Alice is wrong too
4/11/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: N log(n)
4/11/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Is faster than n
4/11/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Is slower
4/11/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But grows faster
4/11/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Slower
4/11/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I mean yeag
4/11/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: N log n isnt upperbounded by n
4/11/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: As soon as log(n) becomes >1, n log n is not upperbounded by n anymore
4/11/17, 13:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so alice is a nono because nlogn grows faster than n bob is yes because sqrt n is slower wer than n and Christ because ?
4/11/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Chris only claims something about a single input. By definition of O(n) it means that if n is sufficiently large it is upperbounded by c*n. So if n>n0 and n0 in this case would be a bigger n as that single input
4/11/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: This idea
4/11/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Chris is wrong too
4/11/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or not?
4/11/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: At first its not upperbounded
4/11/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Later on it is
4/11/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Oh right
4/11/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It could be True
4/11/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So Chris is right
4/11/17, 13:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oh yeah I got it thank :>
4/11/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Np
4/11/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So for k = 10, IT would be 10^2 ×0.1 = 10
4/11/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Is the same as n= 10
4/11/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Op(n)
4/11/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: hard
4/11/17, 13:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: a regular language explaination ? uuuugh ?
4/11/17, 13:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Regular means accepted by a TM
4/11/17, 13:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah but is that a sufficient andwer ?
4/11/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Its the only thing mentioned in the slides
4/11/17, 13:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What about b and c ?
4/11/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: dont u mean finite automaton
4/11/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Oh yeah right sorry
4/11/17, 13:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah chinno is right
4/11/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Example for c is a sms^-1
4/11/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: a*b is a regular language
4/11/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: the language of marked palindromes is not
4/11/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Couldnt come up with that word
4/11/17, 13:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Aaah yeah for b we explain it because it has a infinite set of finite words
4/11/17, 13:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Amirite  ?
4/11/17, 13:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What about c tho
4/11/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: langauge of marked palindromes
4/11/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: sms^-1 as thomas said
4/11/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: s is a sequence
4/11/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: You have to explain aswell
4/11/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: m is a special marker
4/11/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: s^-1 is s but inverted
4/11/17, 13:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Was that the explaination ?
4/11/17, 13:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🙄
4/11/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: mention that it cannot be implemented with a finite automaton
4/11/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: as well
4/11/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: and then formulate it a bit nicer and that should be it
4/11/17, 13:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh oki..  🐒
4/11/17, 13:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Damn they gave us a full page for 6 sentences...
4/11/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: its called Kleene's theorem, maybe if you mention that name its ok
4/11/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you should definitely mention that (I completely forgot about that thing :O)
4/11/17, 13:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah i know about kleenes
4/11/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: if you say well according to kleenes theorem a language is regular when it is accepted by a finite automaton
4/11/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: that should be good
4/11/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 👍🏽
4/11/17, 13:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Lol even less than 6 sentences on a full rmpty page 😅
4/11/17, 13:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Onr more question since those are the once i couldnt make
4/11/17, 13:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: About 5
4/11/17, 13:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: On a wtf do we use ?
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Is moving stuff connected to running time ?
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Selection sort i think
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: why are you donig ds here
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Because with selection sort you move at most every element once
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ds ?
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i left the ds chat to not see ds anymore
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and now youre doing it here
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: pls
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: this is fundamentals
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: This is fundamentals max
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is this not ds?
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it looks like ds
4/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: this is 'easy' ds
4/11/17, 13:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its almost the samr 🦑
4/11/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: @31634642931 dont you have to more every item that is not the minimum
4/11/17, 13:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Max sorry there is no group for fundamentals resit as far as i am aware of
4/11/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: its either selection sort or insertion sort
4/11/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it's selection sort
4/11/17, 13:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Explaination ? Because you move everything at most one time ?
4/11/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: exactly that
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Does that make it faster than insertion ?
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: no
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: but less moving
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh shit yea
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: ^
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Fuck this is confusing
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And if they ask about fast ?
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: selection sort is the slowest sorting algo
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it always takes n^2 time
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: if the array is almost completely sorted, insertion sort
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Yup answered merge sort because i thought they meant fastest algotithm
4/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: else quicksort probably
4/11/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: or mergesort
4/11/17, 13:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Merge is nlogn
4/11/17, 13:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Quick is usualy nlogn but can be n^2
4/11/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: if you can guarantee a good pivot it's nlogn
4/11/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: expected
4/11/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Merge sort would be faster but they specific ask for minimum amount of replacing elements
4/11/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: And merging only replaces everything
4/11/17, 13:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah yeah not on the same question i understand that i just try to imagine if they ask for fast
4/11/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: i answered quick sort on that and i think i got it right
4/11/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I answered selection sort and got it right
4/11/17, 13:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How are you sure you got it right 😐
4/11/17, 13:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😅
4/11/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: k nvm then i lost my 1 point from that question lol
4/11/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: we got a rubrics from the test a while ago
4/11/17, 13:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Lol what ? 😄😆
4/11/17, 13:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ah you mean grade
4/11/17, 13:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah got it
4/11/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Lol where?
4/11/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: as in, how many points you got for each question
4/11/17, 13:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Where ?!?
4/11/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: let me check if I can find it
4/11/17, 13:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😟
4/11/17, 13:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also what about b ?
4/11/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: its on canvas
4/11/17, 13:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Dont we just use merge sort ?
4/11/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: results anonymized or smth its called
4/11/17, 13:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh yeah i saw that one
4/11/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Oh yeah thnx
4/11/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: there you can see how many points you got on each question
4/11/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: merge sort isnt in place so ist super expensive
4/11/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 13:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What then ?
4/11/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: array A and B are already sorted, so merge sort is not necceasry
4/11/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: if theyre sorted you just compare the first items of each array and whichever one is smaller you dump into the new array
4/11/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: O(n)
4/11/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: and if one of the things is nil you place the other one in the new array
4/11/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: since you don't know their lengths
4/11/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: good point
4/11/17, 13:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🙏🏿👴🏿
4/11/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: or you add infinity at the ends of both arrays
4/11/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: and then you don't need the nil-check
4/11/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: maybe just add a while loop
4/11/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: lengths are Na and Nb
4/11/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: so you know the lengths
4/11/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: or use a for loop: for i=1 to A.length+B.length do
4/11/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: as you need to place every element in the new array anyhow
4/11/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: oh I fucked that one up
4/11/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: same
4/11/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: question 9 is always fucking cryptography
4/11/17, 13:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: anyone on 9?
4/11/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, I can explain them, but it is a lot of typing
4/11/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Afaik it is in the summary
4/11/17, 13:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: nop
4/11/17, 13:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: the summary only has like a few things that don't help much
4/11/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, then look at the slides
4/11/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It does not require a lot of thinking tbh
4/11/17, 13:52 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanks :}
4/11/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: thats what i thought during the exam, still didnt got any points on them
4/11/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I also uploaded the file Abstracts-Natuur.pdf to cs-students.nl, which is a higher resolution version of the physics summary without the watermark
4/11/17, 13:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thanks 👴🏿
4/11/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Do we have to know for fundamentals how long it takes to build a min/max heap from an array and so yes how long does it take?
4/11/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: It takes O(n)
4/11/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I think you dont have to
4/11/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But Indeed O n
4/11/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Dont know if it was part of fundamentals
4/11/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Atleast i know now
4/11/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: sorted or unsorted array?
4/11/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I think it does not matter
4/11/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: I think it was just Data Structures. Doesn't hurt to know, though.
4/11/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Speckmann literally said: "You can always build a heap in O👎 time, no matter the input size"
4/11/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: oh
4/11/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: trust speckmann
4/11/17, 14:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: dat time tho :D
4/11/17, 14:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: O👎
4/11/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Thanks to some difficult math that she showed on slides.
4/11/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Those emoji runtimes are though
4/11/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬: Faster than constant time right! 😁
4/11/17, 15:45 - Maria Pravin: Does anyone know where is the fundamentals exam?
4/11/17, 15:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Audi 5 and 6
4/11/17, 15:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Check time table for the second room but the first one is 5
4/11/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 15:46 - Maria Pravin: Ah okay thanks!
4/11/17, 15:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Do you need 15 / 30  or what ?
4/11/17, 15:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: On exam fundamentals
4/11/17, 15:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Or 20?
4/11/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: yeh
4/11/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: i got 14.5 last time
4/11/17, 15:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Daaamn
4/11/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: and didnt pass
4/11/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: so
4/11/17, 15:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What was your grade ?
4/11/17, 15:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I mean do we need a 5 or a 5.5 ?
4/11/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: 4.8
4/11/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: a 5 if your assignment grades were good enuff
4/11/17, 15:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What is good enough ?
4/11/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: average a 5.5
4/11/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: 40% is assignments
4/11/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: with final and assignments
4/11/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: 60% exam
4/11/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Together need 5.5
4/11/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: i got 8.1 on assignments
4/11/17, 15:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ah oki let me check
4/11/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: But minimal 5 on exam
4/11/17, 15:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Wait how do we check ?
4/11/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Osiris?
4/11/17, 15:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ah nevermind i saw it
4/11/17, 15:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I got 6 so thats enough right ? 👴🏿🙏🏿
4/11/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No
4/11/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: not to score a 5.5 average
4/11/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 40% * 6 + 60% * 5 is nog a 5.5
4/11/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: not*
4/11/17, 15:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Lol wait what  ?
4/11/17, 15:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I need how much then
4/11/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: exam is 60% and assignments are 40%
4/11/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: calculate it
4/11/17, 15:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Well i need 1 point more
4/11/17, 16:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 16 / 3  5.333
4/11/17, 16:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 5.33 *0.6  3.198
4/11/17, 16:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 0.4 * 6   2.4
4/11/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Where did you get to 16/3 :p
4/11/17, 16:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Final grade is points / 3
4/11/17, 16:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 30  points max
4/11/17, 16:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 16/30
4/11/17, 16:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So 16/3 5.333
4/11/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 13.3
4/11/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: they also give halve points
4/11/17, 16:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Loool 🤣
4/11/17, 16:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Half a point for good looks john 😄
4/11/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: thats my secret
4/11/17, 16:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So 16/3 is 5.33 
5.33 *0.6 = 3.19
0.4* 6 = 2.4 
2.4 + 3.19 = 5.59
4/11/17, 16:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Enough right
4/11/17, 16:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Althouh i expect more than 16 😆as long as they dont decide some weird shit
4/11/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: *insert random numbers an calculation to seem smart but i have actually no idea what i'm doing*
4/11/17, 16:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Lol tobin i am pretty sure i calculated my panic leves correct @31640998750
4/11/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: >9000?
4/11/17, 16:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I would just say they are np hard
4/11/17, 16:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also the expression a+b is a or b or ab right ?
4/11/17, 16:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: + means and or ?
4/11/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I thought it meant one or more, so one or more a's followed by a 'b'
4/11/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: huh
4/11/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: that's * right
4/11/17, 16:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: * is 0 or more
4/11/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: + means or
4/11/17, 16:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: A* is 0 or more A's
4/11/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: One is one or More, the other is zero or more
4/11/17, 16:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so what is A+B
4/11/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: A or b
4/11/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: a or b
4/11/17, 16:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can it accept ab?
4/11/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: not ab
4/11/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Both are accepted
4/11/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: so not inclusive?
4/11/17, 16:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so A+B is either a or b
4/11/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Depends on what the halting state says
4/11/17, 16:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and what about (A+B)*
4/11/17, 16:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: that's all right ?
4/11/17, 16:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: like every single thing ?
4/11/17, 16:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: nothing or a or aa or b or bb  or ab or ba and so on?
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I guess so
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: that's retarded
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :D
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: according to wikipedia
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: it means
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: one or more occurences of the preceding element
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yeah
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: so a+b
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: means
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: wait what ?
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: ab
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: aab
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: aaab
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: thats what wikipedia says
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: what :s
4/11/17, 16:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: noooot sure if that's right in our course
4/11/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Shouldnt listen to stijn
4/11/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: yeah i have serious doubts about that lmao
4/11/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: so do i
4/11/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: but its what wikipedia says
4/11/17, 16:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Wikipedia is not TUE ! :D
4/11/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: do they mention it anywhere in the syllabus
4/11/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: (A+B)* is what you described
4/11/17, 16:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 16:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: there we go boys
4/11/17, 16:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: * means whatever is before it 0 or more times
4/11/17, 16:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: A+B means a or b  or ab
4/11/17, 16:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: just look at example 1
4/11/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: (A+b)* can also mean abababab...
4/11/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: example 1 doesnt conclusively say that also accepts ab
4/11/17, 16:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yes
4/11/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: It doesnt
4/11/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Only a or b
4/11/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: alright, so exclusive or then
4/11/17, 16:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: are we sure about that ?
4/11/17, 16:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so its just or
4/11/17, 16:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: not and/or
4/11/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: It should accept everything with the pattern aa and the regular is expression is with the or
4/11/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: So abababaabababa should be accepted
4/11/17, 16:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so A+b means a or b but (A+B)* means EVERYTHING ?
4/11/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Yeah
4/11/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I would say it means everything
4/11/17, 16:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: keep in mind in example one A+B has a start too
4/11/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: it does mean everything dimitar
4/11/17, 16:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and a start on a A+B is everything including nothing
4/11/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: any pattern of as and bs can be reached with (a+b)*
4/11/17, 16:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: starr*
4/11/17, 16:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yes
4/11/17, 16:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but  just A+B is a or b finaly right ?
4/11/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: the slides say exclusive or
4/11/17, 16:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oki
4/11/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: it says r1+r2 means everything that is either r1 or r2
4/11/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: meaning not both
4/11/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: there we go
4/11/17, 16:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thankksu :>
4/11/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Its one of the two but because of the asterix you can have infinite amount of or's
4/11/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: This
4/11/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: What happens when you use dijkstra's algorithm when there are negative edges?
4/11/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: It skips those
4/11/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 👍🏽
4/11/17, 16:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: dijkstra doenst work with negative edges that a prerequisite so it will just ignoe that edge
4/11/17, 16:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: that's a possible question
4/11/17, 16:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: why dijkstra on graph x wont give us the shortest path
4/11/17, 16:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: it will choose 2+3 instead of 5+  _4
4/11/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I was reading that question thats why i asked
4/11/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: It will work it just won't give you the shortest path 😁
4/11/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: It doesn't always skip a negative edge
4/11/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: It depends
4/11/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But it wont give the shortest path
4/11/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: If I remember well in the left scenario it will take the negative edge
4/11/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Because its the smallest
4/11/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: On the right it will go for the 4 edge because locally thats the smallest but the output will be wrong because taking the 5 and -3 will be shorter
4/11/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: *would have been shorter
4/11/17, 16:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I am pretty sure that ddijkstra never uses negatives
4/11/17, 16:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: its a prerequisite
4/11/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yes because it fails as in the second image
4/11/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: *graph
4/11/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Doesn't mean it just ignores them
4/11/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: At least thats what I thought
4/11/17, 16:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 16:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: non negative weight
4/11/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yes I know. Dijkstra want you to give in only positive edges. I'm only trying to show what will happen if you DO give in negative edges. Namely on line 7 that negative edge is the lowest edge
4/11/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But Dijkstra's algorithm fails to give the shortest path
4/11/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But whatever you like;)
4/11/17, 16:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thank you the help is much apreciated
4/11/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think Dimi is right. As negative edges are not an acceptable input I think it'll give errors?
4/11/17, 16:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: no it wont
4/11/17, 16:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: it just ignores them
4/11/17, 16:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: it was in one of the exams
4/11/17, 16:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: you have a dijkstra path that has 2 options
4/11/17, 16:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 2+3 and 5 + (-4)
4/11/17, 16:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: dijkstra chooses 2+3
4/11/17, 16:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: because it ignores -4
4/11/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 😒😒😒😒
4/11/17, 16:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: that's why it gives wrong answer
4/11/17, 16:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what do you want maxu
4/11/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk i just read the word dijkstra and got triggered
4/11/17, 16:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :< sorru
4/11/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Does a regular language always also excepts empty input?
4/11/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: And (a+b)*? Is that skippable?
4/11/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: yup * can also means it doesnt happen
4/11/17, 17:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yes
4/11/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Last attempt to convince you dimitar ;p
4/11/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You want from s to f
4/11/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Locally -2 is best solution
4/11/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: So dijkstra takes that as smallest edge
4/11/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Locally 3 is best solution so it will take that
4/11/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: This (non tue) slide basically confirms what im saying
4/11/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Tijs
4/11/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Yeah exactly
4/11/17, 17:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: papa bless man ❤
4/11/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Wanted to post the same file
4/11/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: The way i thought about it on the question of the exam was that basically the algorithm already decided that since (a,c) was already less than (a,b) there was no reason to check for (b,c)
4/11/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: There is an algorithm that does incorporate negatives
4/11/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: It uses relaxe () alott
4/11/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Relax*
4/11/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: how to find the minimum hamming distance?
4/11/17, 17:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Uuuhm what ?
4/11/17, 17:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Just do the hamming tree
4/11/17, 17:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Match them
4/11/17, 17:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So they make the smallest sum
4/11/17, 17:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 2 by 2
4/11/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: hamming tree?
4/11/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Yeah a sort of binary tree
4/11/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Leafs are the lowest probabilities
4/11/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: And then add then together
4/11/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Every right edge gets a 1
4/11/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Every left gets a 0
4/11/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is there not a fundamentals chat guys
4/11/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: you guys mean huffman's algorithm
4/11/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: im getting spammed by the spam is kick chat
4/11/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Yeah
4/11/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: Hamming distance it's the minimum difference between bits of the encoded messages
4/11/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: This is not spam, this is answering a question?
4/11/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: could you take this convo to the fundamentals chat please?
4/11/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: nope
4/11/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah i know, but my phone is crashing because of the amount of messages lol
4/11/17, 17:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Delete os ?
4/11/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Mute it max
4/11/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He already has done so
4/11/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 😂whats the problem then
4/11/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well it is crashing his phone.. As he is saying
4/11/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Where do i find past exams for comp systems now that oase is down
4/11/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Max wtf i have the same phone And i have 0 problemo
4/11/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He prolly needs to delete the message history
4/11/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just too much for whatsapp to load maybe
4/11/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: In osiris ?
4/11/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Could be, But they are mostly stored And not loaded unless you request Then
4/11/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Them
4/11/17, 17:40 - Luke Houben: @31614549685 i'll upload them to cs-stud in 10 minutes
4/11/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oki
4/11/17, 17:48 - Luke Houben: Okay uploaded
4/11/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thank u
4/11/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Do you have the exam we took
4/11/17, 17:55 - Luke Houben: Hmm i think so but paper version tho
4/11/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Can u also put the solutions
4/11/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I dont remember if there were solutions but
4/11/17, 17:58 - Luke Houben: The files that are online now are the only files that were given to us
4/11/17, 17:59 - Luke Houben: You can take a look here though https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3fxf8CEgz7dWWxreE1rbG8xMEE
4/11/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: There were solutions on google drive
4/11/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Yeah that one
4/11/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Okay
4/11/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: and we can use a calculator for physics resit right?
4/11/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sort of
4/11/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Everybody can
4/11/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But you don't
4/11/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: You can even use a graphical calculator if I'm not mistaken
4/11/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: we could last time
4/11/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: so probabaly as well for the resit
4/11/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes that is allowed
4/11/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'd think that is the case because it is his weight (m1*g)
4/11/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And m1*a because that is the extra weight m2 is pulling from it
4/11/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Could also say m2*g = m1*a
4/11/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Right?
4/11/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: No
4/11/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: The acceleration is for the whole system
4/11/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i think there is a slight mistake in the correction model
4/11/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Not only m1
4/11/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is probably why I'm doing the resit
4/11/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: since i think the answer should be T = m2 * a + m2*g
4/11/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But then why is T what Tobin asked
4/11/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oooh
4/11/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but in this example m1 is the mass moving downwards
4/11/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: in the question i asked m2 is the mass moving down
4/11/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: or doesnt that make a differen
4/11/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: ce
4/11/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm if the info you found is trustworthy I'd say the answer is wrong indeed
4/11/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thr person typing it says m1 goes up though
4/11/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "assuming m1 moves upwards"
4/11/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: lol you are right
4/11/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So maybe just remember this :p
4/11/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: THEN WHY
4/11/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's what imma do
4/11/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lemme think! :d
4/11/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh I know
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait I can explain the original
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yes i get it now
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You question
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: :S
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No but also the why
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: To visualize it
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i know why
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okidoki :p
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: sorry
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: :D
4/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: just because the picture was wrong my answer didnt make sense
4/11/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Let's move on and fail another one. Keep sharing these things though, I didn't know this first
4/11/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but now it does
4/11/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How did you calculate the acceleration?
4/11/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: uhm well
4/11/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: m2 moves has a gravitational pull of m2*g
4/11/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but it is being held back by m1, because m1 has a pull of m1*g
4/11/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so the total force on the system is m2*g-m1*g
4/11/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you want accelartion, so since F = m * a, you divide m2*g=m1*g by the total mass of the system
4/11/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: a = g*(m2-m1)   /    m1+m2
4/11/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: ALSO GUYS PLEASE CHECK IF YOUR CALCULATOR IS SET TO DEGREES INSTEAD OF RADIANS
4/11/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks for the thorough explanation!
4/12/17, 08:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Where is physics resit?
4/12/17, 08:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Audi
4/12/17, 08:23 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ty
4/12/17, 08:23 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Which
4/12/17, 08:40 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: They sent an email with the rooms
Either 09 or 10 I think, but you gotta check which one you're assigned to
4/12/17, 08:47 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Huh
4/12/17, 08:47 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: 9 and 10 are wrong
4/12/17, 08:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What do you mean wrong ? 😄
4/12/17, 08:48 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: No physics there
4/12/17, 08:48 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I cant reach my email
4/12/17, 08:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
4/12/17, 08:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Audi 9
4/12/17, 08:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31614418848
4/12/17, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Okay ty
4/12/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: They say its wrong
4/12/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Wtf
4/12/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Fuck this
4/12/17, 08:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Who says its wrong ?
4/12/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Isn't it from 6 til 9?
4/12/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Are you there now or what?
4/12/17, 08:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ahahha yeah its from 18 dude
4/12/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I hope he realises that
4/12/17, 08:55 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh my god, this is hilarious
4/12/17, 08:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
4/12/17, 08:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: It is in almost anything
4/12/17, 08:55 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: What theruck
4/12/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, resits are always in the evening
4/12/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Oooooo
4/12/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: My god
4/12/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Hahahahaha
4/12/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: HAHAHAHAH HAKAN
4/12/17, 08:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hakan rip 🤣
4/12/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This is one of the more glorious moments of SfS 2016
4/12/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: "The day Hakan did not know that his exam was in the evening"
4/12/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Lol
4/12/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Okay
4/12/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Fuck
4/12/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: With the physics exam, do they always check your calculations, or only if your answer is wrong?
4/12/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Idk
4/12/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: They must be checkig calculations
4/12/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: good question
4/12/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i think always
4/12/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Otherwise id fail i think 😂
4/12/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I would have failed*
4/12/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, it might be that they only check if your answer is incorrect
4/12/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Only. Checking the answer is unfair
4/12/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: May have done a calculation mistake
4/12/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: They cant give u straight zero for that
4/12/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Otherwise exam would be multiple choice
4/12/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Isil are you even reading what Rick is asking
4/12/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Ye
4/12/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: because what you arer saying doesnt make any sense
4/12/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: not relating to his question i mean
4/12/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: -_-
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: He asked if they are checking calculations
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: if your answer is correct yes
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I dont think i misunderstood that
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I don't think they actually do check it if it's correct
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I mean why would they
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nono guys
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Listen up
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: The chance of having it correct otherwise is so small
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I had only 1 correct final answer and I had a 4.9
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So they check everything
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And give points for everything
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Yeah thats what im fucking saying
4/12/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Ahh alright
4/12/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 😠😠😠😠😠
4/12/17, 10:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: they MUST be checking because i had 0 correct and didn't write on 3 of them and i got 4 :D
4/12/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Final answer on paper is just for visibility when you write a lot of scratch
4/12/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I know that they check the calculation if your answer is wrong
4/12/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am only wondering if they do that as well if your answer is correct
4/12/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: why does nobody understand the question lol
4/12/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Not sure Tobin lol
4/12/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: is there anyone who had a lot of questions correct, but all his calculations were faulty and therefore had a low grade?
4/12/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: thats the question
4/12/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: they ALWAYS check your calculations
4/12/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if you get the right answer by dumb fucking luck and your calculations dont make sense, you WILL NOT get any points
4/12/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Since you get points from steps of calculations, i think those people only get less than half (If every calculation is wrong)
4/12/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Thanks @31621372984
4/12/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Or like max
4/12/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I've had questions where it was the case in high school, that's why I was wondering
4/12/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: questions --> tests
4/12/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why would they :p
4/12/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: No, your calculations are more important than your answer
4/12/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Full points!
4/12/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, idk
4/12/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Writing down all calculations but no answer will give you all but 1 points. If you only write down the answer and no calculations will give you only 1 point.
4/12/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Probably because it saves them quite a lot of correction work
4/12/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: I've actually often heard teachers say that they give 0 points if you don't give calculations. Not sure if that's the same for Uni, though.
4/12/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Well if that were the case that'd only strengthen my point hahah
4/12/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: They actually did for me, in the refraction question, used 0.66 instead of 0.667 in my calculations and at the inspection I looked at my exam and I got a 0 because of that. 
Complained about it but they still didn't want to give me any points (formula was correct, just missed that one digit)
But I wouldn't have passed anyway so I didn't bother further.
4/12/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Just fucking write down calculations @31642623926
4/12/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am going to do it, just wondering
4/12/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: The lecturer said he would've given me the points tho
4/12/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Hjalmar bae
4/12/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: does anyone know if we are allowed to use a calculator for modelling?
4/12/17, 10:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i think no
4/12/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That rules out some possible questions :)
4/12/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So nice
4/12/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/12/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Haha
4/12/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is not funny sir
4/12/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
4/12/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Potential energy is relative so the final potential energy has a certian value because it ia relative to the intial position which is lower
4/12/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ah, that makes kinda sense!
4/12/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Thanks!
4/12/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Anytime ;)
4/12/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/12/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That converts the velocity of the blocks to the velocity of the wheel
4/12/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Like, the wheel moves at the speed of the rope
4/12/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooh damn you needed to calculate that velocity
4/12/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And that is vf
4/12/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pfooh
4/12/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Since for calculating the rotational kinetic energy you need the angular velocity, you need to convert them using v=r*w
4/12/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (And yes, I know that it isn't w but a difficult greek letter)
4/12/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is tau, right?
4/12/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: the w?
4/12/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No that's a small omega
4/12/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Omega, tau
4/12/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It's the same
4/12/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahaha
4/12/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Almost
4/12/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: tau is the weird t
4/12/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: ω and τ
4/12/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: ωhat?
4/12/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: ιoι
4/12/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: could've added the tau as well
4/12/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Missed opportunity
4/12/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>

4/12/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: oh god please no
4/12/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i cant handle any more of that right now
4/12/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I can't seem to grasp how I can get from the second picture's formulas to the first picture's usage
4/12/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well then maybe someone else knows it? :/
4/12/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it uses 3.20
4/12/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: look at equation 3.20 and just insert the value for t
4/12/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thats all
4/12/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well but 3.20 has - 1/2 (g t^2) behind it
4/12/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And they just drop that or something
4/12/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ?
4/12/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what do you mean
4/12/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: equation 3.20
4/12/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: do you mean the first or the second formula in the first picture
4/12/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: has the minus thingy behind
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and in the first picture they give the v0y = v0 sin theta
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah but daa
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: While the summary says vy = v0 sin theta - 1/2 (g t^2)
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: n
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: at voy =0
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i mean
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: at v0y t=0
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ah
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thank you
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I will show myself out
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and multiplying 1/2g by 0^2
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: gives 0
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah thanks
4/12/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yep...

4/12/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: this is the point where I should stop and start confessing my sins maybe

4/13/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Meaning she did the answer at physics wrong because the calculator gives a wrong answer for the exact same calculation
4/13/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And yes it is set to degrees obviously
4/13/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Both of them are
4/13/17, 00:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: She did /2pi
4/13/17, 00:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And calculator saw it as /2×pi
4/13/17, 00:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: She didnt put brackets at the end of the first calculation
4/13/17, 00:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh damn
4/13/17, 00:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thank you Adriano
4/13/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: What question was that btw?
4/13/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 9
4/13/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: With the spider?
4/13/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The spring constant k for the web
4/13/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 2.7 (rounded)
4/13/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: How did you get it?
4/13/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lemme think
4/13/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I grabbed this formula and could just fill it all in
4/13/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Because that answer is 13
4/13/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For the hertz?
4/13/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yes
4/13/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I had 13 at B
4/13/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeeey
4/13/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: My test had 15
4/13/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Me2
4/13/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then k was 2.7 as well
4/13/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Else I didn't have the 13Hz correct haha
4/13/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Oh for b
4/13/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: How did you get 2.7 then?
4/13/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lemme explain
4/13/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: One sec
4/13/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/13/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yes I did that
4/13/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Took this badboy and just filled it in and swapped it around for k
4/13/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But I got to 4.0 I think
4/13/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So k was 2.7
4/13/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Or 3.0
4/13/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: One of the two
4/13/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm I had 2.66
4/13/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Or just pass the course the first time 🙄
4/13/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Because you get k = 2pi m f^2
4/13/17, 00:23 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Kut sander
4/13/17, 00:23 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Lul

4/13/17, 00:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 🤓
4/13/17, 00:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: My 2 pi didnt become 4pi^2
4/13/17, 00:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Lol
4/13/17, 00:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Whoops, I know those...
4/13/17, 00:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For B it was just filling in the numbers in the original
4/13/17, 00:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Well hopefully they count b as a doorrekenfout
4/13/17, 00:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pretty sure they do actually
4/13/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Only not all points
4/13/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yeah
4/13/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So 1 for a and 1 for b at least
4/13/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maybe 3 total
4/13/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But not 4 of course
4/13/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Always those little things that mess you up
4/13/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They are really generous in this course. I had a 4.9 for the original test while I only had 1 final answer correct
4/13/17, 00:28 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Oh lol
4/13/17, 00:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😋
4/13/17, 00:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31618608079 , did you, for 10 (wheelchair), also use torque calculation with rotation axis at the curb-edge?
To calculate the necessary counterforce at the leftmost part of the wheel (considering they gave you the nice point mass and all distances), which equals the force needed at the top since it doens't differ where on the wheel you apply it
4/13/17, 00:32 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yes
4/13/17, 00:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Great
4/13/17, 00:32 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Thats exactly what I did
4/13/17, 00:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😊
4/13/17, 00:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Feelsgoodman

4/13/17, 00:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I have my doubts about the electrical circuit question though
4/13/17, 00:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Had some weird fractions before I got to my final answers
4/13/17, 00:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I2 was negative and I1 positive iirc, but the values I don't remember
4/13/17, 00:34 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I didnt understand the water pressure part b
4/13/17, 00:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I1 2.7A or so and I2 -0.87? (From the memory)
4/13/17, 00:34 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: With the broken pipe
4/13/17, 00:35 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Im not sure what I had there
4/13/17, 00:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Questions was way too ambiguous, but what I think they meant to ask is the following
4/13/17, 00:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In these questions the only thing that matters if you look at the needed formula is the density and the height of the water
4/13/17, 00:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since the heigh does not change but only the slope of the pipe (to vertical), nothing happens to the pressure
4/13/17, 00:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Only the pipe gets shorter
4/13/17, 00:36 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yes but they said there was a hole in the pipe
4/13/17, 00:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah that was weird
4/13/17, 00:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No idea what they meant
4/13/17, 00:36 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: So you lose pressure
4/13/17, 00:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I thought a hole at the bottom where the water is supposed to come out
4/13/17, 00:37 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But we couldnt calculate anything right because we didnt know how big the hole was
4/13/17, 00:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If there's a hole large enough you actually loose all pressure I think, since it wil just all fall down the hole
4/13/17, 00:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think we should all email them about it
4/13/17, 00:37 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Good idea
4/13/17, 00:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because I haven't spoken anyone who understood what the wanted
4/13/17, 00:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And that says a lot
4/13/17, 00:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I mean I could do it wrong, no worries
4/13/17, 00:37 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yeah it was a weird question
4/13/17, 00:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But we have no idea what they even tried to say
4/13/17, 00:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Mailing them right now
4/13/17, 00:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do it as well please
4/13/17, 00:38 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yeah tomorrow morning ;)
4/13/17, 00:38 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Gonna sleep noe
4/13/17, 00:38 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Now
4/13/17, 00:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good idea
4/13/17, 00:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I sent them a mail with detailed description
4/13/17, 00:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I recommend other people with the same problem to do the same, so that they realise there is a problem. :)
4/13/17, 00:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good night!
4/13/17, 00:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Something something co@gewis.nl
4/13/17, 00:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, I understood what they wanted, it was just vaguely worded
4/13/17, 00:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did you?
4/13/17, 00:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What did they want
4/13/17, 00:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because I honestly don't have a clue haha
4/13/17, 00:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Don't care about having the answer wrong or not but I do not even know what they asked
4/13/17, 01:27 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I thought they meant a hole which would create some kind of geyser
4/13/17, 01:28 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: But theres no way to calculate the height without the size of the hole...
4/13/17, 07:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, I think that you should've assumed that the jet stayed uniform until the top
4/13/17, 07:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Like as it traveled through a pipe
4/13/17, 07:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So, what you had to to was calculate the height of the tank
4/13/17, 07:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Which was sin(\Theta) + 5 iirc
4/13/17, 07:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You could've also used Bernoulli
4/13/17, 07:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, I did the resit for a reason, so please don't trust me too much :p
4/13/17, 07:50 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: 110sin58+5
4/13/17, 08:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But you also needed this value for A
4/13/17, 08:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since the pressure depended on the actual height anyway
4/13/17, 08:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No matter the slope
4/13/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This, yes
4/13/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If people are interested, I took my answers out of the exam room, I can share them?
4/13/17, 09:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Could you confirm whether this was the same formula for A?
4/13/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes, you needed that value for A IIRC
4/13/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks
4/13/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Anyway:
1. 180.7m
2. Didn't do this one

9b. 25.9 Hz
4/13/17, 09:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But, the exact answers will be uploaded today probably
4/13/17, 09:36 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: At 9b you didn't at the 0,10 to the 0,30 of the spider I think
4/13/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, fuck
4/13/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 7b I had te same Rick
4/13/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, I misread that question
4/13/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 57969978‬ left
4/13/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Same yup
4/13/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Woohoo
4/13/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Was also doubting that one haha
4/13/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It was less tidy than practice ones
4/13/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But thought I did the right way
4/13/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Always good to see others had the same when you doubted
4/13/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
4/13/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
4/13/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Because x can't be 3
4/13/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You will dividend by 0
4/13/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Isnt that the vertical asymptote ?
4/13/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: The one that occurs when the denominator is zero
4/13/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: X=-3 ?
4/13/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Not sure
4/13/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Well thx anyway 👍🏻
4/13/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
4/13/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Since the limit with the sin(x)/(x+3) goes to zero, f(x) will act like x²/(x+3) if it goes to infinity, so you can calculate the oblique asymptote for that function by division, which gives x-3
4/13/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yes !
Thank you 👌🏻
4/13/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: does anyone have solutions of past exams for comp systems

4/13/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: We had them I think
4/13/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Idk where tho

4/13/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: there is only one solution
4/13/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: there
4/13/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: only from one exam is on here tho
4/13/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm
4/13/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is it that question?
4/13/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i think we sent them in group chat most of the time during exam week
4/13/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: but i dont have the history anymore
4/13/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: :{
4/13/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am pretty willing to work that one out?
4/13/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yes ALU questions
4/13/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i need the answers of them mostly
4/13/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Did you already do it yourself?
4/13/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i am trying to learn it by looking at the solutions
4/13/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i know the initial steps but i need help for next steps
4/13/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm, sec then
4/13/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i think there was a google drive for comp systems
4/13/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
4/13/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And yes, there was a drive
4/13/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Rubain had it, but he is getting stoned atm
4/13/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3fxf8CEgz7dR0FzQjY0WEZqNlE
4/13/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But I found it!
4/13/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Yayy
4/13/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thank you
4/13/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: So much
4/13/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hey, I want people to pass :P
4/13/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 🙏🏻
4/13/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: when is it ALU"A" and when is it ALU "B" in second line
4/13/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Second line?
4/13/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: In the standard instruction fetch, you mean?
4/13/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Allahu*
4/13/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yes
4/13/17, 14:23 - Bas Gieling: ALU:"something" is how you tell the ALU what operation to do. So in this case, you only want the ALU to pass the information on the B-bus through to the instruction register. So thats why its ALU:"B"
4/13/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Exactly this
4/13/17, 14:24 - Bas Gieling: in other cases, you may want to do other operations on both values on both buses, so then it would be ALU:"A OR B" for example, then the ALU would compute the value of A OR B and pass it through to the C-bus
4/13/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i understand thank you
4/13/17, 14:28 - Bas Gieling: youre welcome :)
4/13/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Logic resit is at paviljoen right?
4/13/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: another logic resit?
4/13/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: That'd be logic re-resit for you
4/13/17, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Can we still access the sharepoint sites of the courses
4/13/17, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: ?
4/13/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: because oase is down so no folders to click on anymore :s
4/13/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: <Media omitted>
4/13/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: These are all the links
4/13/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: ah thank you
4/14/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
4/14/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: One or zero
4/14/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 0 I think
4/14/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Should we choose the one that has least number of groups?
4/14/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That one only needs two groups
4/14/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oki
4/14/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah
4/14/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because for every group you have to add a thing to the expression
4/14/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Tru
4/14/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The expression becomes something like group1/\group2/\group3
4/14/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And you want it as short as possible
4/14/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Yeah oki thankss
4/14/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Butttt if you take the 1's you get 3 very simple expressions
4/14/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Still id take the 0's cause its a bit less work maybe
4/14/17, 11:36 - Bas Gieling: yea its either 2 groups with 3 conditions or 3 groups with 2 conditions, i guess its a matter of personal preference
4/14/17, 11:36 - Bas Gieling: at least i cant remember jfg saying which one would be best
4/14/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: thats why i couldnt decide 🤔
4/14/17, 11:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: He said thake the one thate is more convinient to work with
4/14/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ill take zeros its shorter i think
4/14/17, 11:38 - Bas Gieling: xD such useful
4/14/17, 11:38 - Bas Gieling: yea id take 0s too x)
4/14/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Rawwr x3
4/14/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: o(｀ω´ )o

4/14/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: With zero you can extend the upper cover thingy to the bottom so you have also a square of 2x2
4/14/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oh true
4/14/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Ill fix that thanks
4/14/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
4/14/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Because it's a ratio, so the unit is (number of products) / (number of products) = 1
4/14/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yes I see
4/14/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Thank you
4/14/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: To find 8bit ones complement of -19 we binary the 19 put zeros until 8 digits and swap ones with zeros and zeros with one rightv
4/14/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: And add 1 to it I believe
4/14/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 👆🏻
4/14/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I think thats twos complement
4/14/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Not ones
4/14/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Oh, mb
4/14/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Swap and add1
4/14/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: You should search for one's complement converter
4/14/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: And try to make it yourself and then check if you were right
4/14/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Okay thanks
4/14/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: guys does anyone have the exam we took for comp systems

4/14/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 14508988‬: It was from our exam
4/14/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I described the thing once for if the register was overwritten with the new value, and described it once for if the register wasn't overwritten with the new value
4/14/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: no idea if that was correct tho
4/14/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: but it was pretty much done the same in the weekly assignment for the conditional jumps (BGE, BLT, etc.)
4/14/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, oh!
4/14/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I sort of know that one
4/14/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But I am sort of eating atm
4/14/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So if I am done eating and nobody else knows I am glad to answer
4/14/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: this years 5th is harder than other years
4/14/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, this one required a bit more knowledge than others
4/14/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Normally it is like 3 things
4/14/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And now it were 9
4/14/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sorry, normally 6, now 9
4/14/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, are there people who are interested in a "OMFG HELP REGISTER TRANSFER CODES AND ASSEMBLY-SESSION?"
4/14/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Monday?
4/14/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah

4/14/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: IR.val contains the parameter
4/14/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So if you have something like ADD R2 5
4/14/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then 5 is stored in IR.val
4/14/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Ah okay
4/14/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I get it

4/15/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Anyone got an idea ?
4/15/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Make the tests on oncoarse, read the summary I guess
4/15/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The tests for math and the tests with question about the chapter from that week
4/15/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Practice general questions with given exams
4/15/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Practice maths by yourself
4/15/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Aight
4/15/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyone got a modeling summary?
4/15/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Cs
4/15/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: -students
4/15/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: just math or also theory?
4/15/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that english though
4/15/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The summary on cs-students only contains theory
4/15/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Math should be practicable by the oncoarse weeklies

4/15/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah I have no clue either
4/15/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Is that question the same every year?
4/15/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: it was only in the one of 2015
4/15/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thusfar
4/15/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: same about c1 and c2 actually, I don't understand that either
4/15/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Is There no open question in 2016?
4/15/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yes there is, but it's different
4/15/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I was trying to order books online but our list is not there... does it mean that automata and ethics do not have books?
4/15/17, 21:28 - Luke Houben: The book for use is already online on cs-students, so i guess the list is not yet completed
4/15/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: hmm
4/15/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: oke thanks!
4/15/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 57866325‬: Use is under 'basisvak', you need 2 books for it
4/15/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Wait what
4/15/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: oh oke thanks
4/15/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: What second book?
4/15/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: what about automata? does anyone know?
4/15/17, 21:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/2it70/
4/15/17, 21:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: tl;dr: there is a reader, and some background material
4/15/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: JSR [ R0+dd ] what is dd
4/15/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The website of the subject has great information
4/15/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: A number

4/15/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm, I had it correct on the exam
4/15/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is 4 states and an error state and iirc every state has a arrow to the error state
4/15/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: iirc?
4/15/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: if i recall correctly
4/15/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: = iirc
4/15/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oh

4/15/17, 22:14 - Bas Gieling: im not sure what you mean, but you dont want the value of sigmaW to transfer to sigmaA, if thats what you intended
4/15/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: How do i put ip in ram sp
4/15/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Otherwise
4/15/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I thought they skipped a line
4/15/17, 22:26 - Bas Gieling: you want the value in IP to transfer to the write register, sigmaW, which is the register for the value that you want to copy to an address in ram, and you want the value of the address where you want to store this to transfer to sigmaA
4/15/17, 22:27 - Bas Gieling: yea the thing in the comments after the 4th line, RAM[SP] <-- IP
4/15/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Ah yeah okay
4/15/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I understand now
4/15/17, 22:28 - Bas Gieling: i think that happens implicitly if you store those values in sigmaW and sigmaA when the clock cycles, id actually put it on the next line myself tbh
4/15/17, 22:28 - Bas Gieling: alright nice :)
4/15/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Can i say RAM[sigmaA]
4/15/17, 22:29 - Bas Gieling: yea
4/15/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Since sp is in Sigma A
4/15/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Alright
4/15/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thanks a lot (๑>◡<๑)
4/15/17, 22:29 - Bas Gieling: np :)
4/15/17, 22:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Bass i am pretty sure that if you want to put something in the ram of sigma a you need to say Ram(sigma a ) <- sigma e
4/15/17, 22:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sigma *
4/15/17, 22:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: W
4/15/17, 22:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I never read anywhere that it hapoes automaticly

4/15/17, 22:42 - Bas Gieling: yea thats possible dimitar, i always wrote it down myself too, but i can also see why it might not be necessary
4/15/17, 22:43 - Bas Gieling: storing those values in the registers and enabling their outputs on the ram side would just do the trick, and as the book skipped the line there (while they did put it in the comment) i guessed it was allowed to skip that step
4/15/17, 22:46 - Bas Gieling: one of the 3 factors in the equation has to equal 0, which gives 3 easier equations, from there its pretty standard i guess
4/15/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: ok thanks
4/15/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: can we use a graphical calculator for modelling?
4/15/17, 23:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: No idea
4/15/17, 23:18 - Bas Gieling: dont think so, but maybe
4/16/17, 00:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Does anyone know when the Propedeuse uitreiking takes place?
4/16/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Somewhere in september I think?
4/16/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 9 october
4/16/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I was just 9 days off
4/16/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahah, nice one Ruben, thanks Ilse!
4/16/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Hahaha
4/16/17, 00:25 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Is that for SfS only or also other majors?
4/16/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Dont know
4/16/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Just remembered the date cause its my birthday
4/16/17, 00:28 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: But it its in the PowerPoint I believe
4/16/17, 00:47 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Thanks, will look tomorrow
4/16/17, 00:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Or later today...
4/16/17, 00:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You could also look the day after tomorrow!

4/16/17, 20:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Before May 19th
4/16/17, 20:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But you can always change later on
4/16/17, 20:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: They just want an estimate
4/16/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Thanks
4/16/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: What books do we need for the standard subjects, and do we need one for hti?
4/16/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Could someone ask this question on cs-students so I can link it Everytime it's asked like a bitch
4/16/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 👆🏼
4/16/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: So... what is the answer
4/16/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Since we have to order books before the 17th
4/16/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: N O T H I N G
4/16/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Niccee
4/16/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: HTI has reference books but they advice you not to buy them
4/16/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Okay, makes sense
4/16/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Where can we find the meeting point for the company visits again? Or at least the locations of the company, since I forgot to write it down
4/16/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Email
4/16/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: When are they
4/16/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: This friday I believe
4/16/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Okay
4/16/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 21 april
4/16/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Alright
4/16/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: The intel one doesn't mention a specific address though, but a quick google gives Intel Benelux eindhoven, I think that is the one for the company visits, right?
4/16/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Email doesnt mention a meeting point
4/16/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: That too, but intel is own transport
4/16/17, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: But it doesn't give an exact location 🙃
4/16/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Doesn't USE use two books?
4/16/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It says so on the books website, but only one is mentioned in the document about the cases we had to register for
4/16/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Books might be on cs-students already
4/16/17, 23:02 - ‪+31 6 28844767‬: One of the two books is a dictate you have to buy at the student shop
4/16/17, 23:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Might or might not, who knows
4/16/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 🙈
4/16/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm gonna take a fucked up long shower, need to be at Schiphol around 02:45
4/17/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: For what?
4/17/17, 00:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ellen asked me to pick her up because she arrived there around 23:45, so I agreed
4/17/17, 00:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Got a text start of the evening "oh yeah plane has 3 hour delay"
4/17/17, 00:40 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Rip
4/17/17, 00:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Seems like NS

4/17/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Verification of a model is the other one, where you check that all the variables are inside the domains you gave for them in the conceptual model
4/17/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Are There tests on oncourse about the theory??
4/17/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes
4/17/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yeah for every chapter there are tests
4/17/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Were they always There?
4/17/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yep, but they have been updated to resemble the final exam better
4/17/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ahh okay
4/17/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Didn't someone claim that Arthur would upload the grades for DS one of these days?
4/17/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I did
4/17/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And it probably is today or tomorrow
4/17/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: And why would that be the case?
4/17/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Normally it takes a lot longer
4/17/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: They are checked already, they only have to be uploaded into the system
4/17/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Oh damn, that's fast
4/17/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: They worked on it all tuesday with 15 persons until 20.30
4/17/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Is there a group chat for computer systems?
4/17/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: From last period? No only fundamentals and computer graphics
4/17/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Not anymore i guess
4/17/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Ahh thanks do you know where I can find answers for past exams?
4/17/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: There is one on cs-students.nl, for the rest there aren't really answers
4/17/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: there are two on cs students
4/17/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: answers + why thats the right answer
4/17/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Wait
4/17/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Ill send u link
4/17/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Here

4/17/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or here
4/17/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: wait
4/17/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: this was not about modeling
4/17/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: LOL
4/17/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: sorry people
4/17/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: my bad
4/17/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Nice try stef
4/17/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Thanks
4/17/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: hey guys, for the tu/e laptop. If i wanna remove all the tu/e shit, is resetting my pc while keeping my files sufficient or should i do a complete reset?
4/17/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: @31643470096 @31623837581
4/17/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: maybe move to the spamchat for personal questions and support
4/17/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Did a full reinstall and have not a single regret
4/17/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i know, but can i do it with only a clean install of windows while keeping my files? You know, for the 4K HD tentai porn that i wanna keep on it
4/17/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Maybe the other chat if hentai is your concern
4/17/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Lol ehh afaik doing a clean install with keeping files is not possible, that would mean you'd have to do something along the lines of a factory reset. Would it be possible to backup your files and do a clean install and then put them back?
4/17/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We'll move Job
4/17/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: The turtle is  grateful
4/17/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Losing your hentai when reinstalling windows is a serious issue
4/17/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
4/17/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Damn !
4/17/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I am so terribly sorry
4/17/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
4/17/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: guys whats with putting GB+ stuff
4/17/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: inside R0
4/17/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i dont get anything about first LOAD STORE lines can someone explain me
4/17/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Yes, clean install allows for the option of keeping files
4/17/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Might wanna backup to be sure
4/17/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You should see [GB+something] as a place to store a variable
4/17/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Like, GB+1, GB+2, etc
4/17/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You can store different things in each of them
4/17/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You use them when you don't have enough registers to save stuff in
4/17/17, 18:47 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: or you can use the stack
4/17/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: <Media omitted>
4/17/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: You get 6 states that you have to encode with 3 digits each, "in"is the only input. When doing the circuit you'll see that you have a bunch of non existing combination for which i used don't cares, but to be fair I'm not sure that's correct
4/17/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: So basically you have the functions s t a(for the third encoding digit) and in, from which you derive the transitions, in the k-map you get blank spaces and I think you need to fill them with not cares but since i cant recall doing any exercise where we had to actively use them(all the other times they were given) i cannot say I'm 100% sure on that, but i don't see any other way around it
4/17/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Okay sounds more correct than what I have done.
4/17/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Okay thanks
4/17/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: Np
4/18/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: <Media omitted>
4/18/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is this modeling?
4/18/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: no max its computer graphics
4/18/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: It is
4/18/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How do they even rewrite the numerator which consists of subtractions and additions to the version with four multiplications?
4/18/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Reading the question helps
4/18/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: They give equilibria
4/18/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Which means those inputs must result in 0
4/18/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
4/18/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Aka before, >0, after <0
4/18/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yes, but they are not exactly supplying a direction field unfortunately enough
4/18/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Take for example 36.3, when you have solutions larger that that, their derivative is negative, so they move down, to 36.3, solutions between 13.7 and 36.3 move up, so you see the solutions near 36.3 go to 36.3 if t gets large
4/18/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Aha
4/18/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I see
4/18/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Youcan make a drawing like this if you want to visualize it, not with all those small arrows you usually see
4/18/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Thanx
4/18/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yeah well the questions can take up a lot of time
4/18/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Just check if the number is above 13.7 or nah
4/18/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thats the only way I understand the question
4/18/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
4/18/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so
4/18/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: how does this bs work...
4/18/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i have never quite understood how those questions work
4/18/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: can someone answer the arrow question on cs-student such that we can all see the answer easily? https://cs-students.nl/questions/14289019
4/18/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: is the answer e
4/18/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: pls tell me the answer is e
4/18/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Yes
4/18/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: YEEES
4/18/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Just calculate the points and you get 1 and 6
4/18/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Then what is around them
4/18/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: So 0, 3 and 7
4/18/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: And you see it goes from + to - to +
4/18/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: + to - is stable then I guess
4/18/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yes
4/18/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Yeah, and - to + is unstable
4/18/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: nice
4/18/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: take one point to the left of it, check if it is positive (=stable) or negative (=unstable)
4/18/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Are we allowed to use a calculator for modeling?
4/18/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: nope
4/18/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: if only we were
4/18/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: would have made my life a whole lot easier
4/18/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you should also take one point to the right of it and check if that's negative as well. (because if that's positive as well, you don't have a stable equilibrium)
4/18/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: what is the difference between the purpose prediction (1) and prediction(2)?
4/18/17, 13:18 - Bas Gieling: prediction (1) is "when will X happen",
prediction (2) is "what will happen if Y"
4/18/17, 13:19 - Bas Gieling: so the difference is basically that 1 doesnt have a "requirement" and 2 does
4/18/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: and what does the purpose "specification" mean?
4/18/17, 13:20 - Bart van Dooren: <Media omitted>
4/18/17, 13:20 - Bas Gieling: a unit vector has to have length 1
4/18/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Length of v
4/18/17, 13:21 - Bas Gieling: and the length of (4,3) is 5, so you divide by 5
4/18/17, 13:21 - Bas Gieling: not sure tbh
4/18/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Sqrt(4^2 + 3^2)
4/18/17, 13:22 - Bas Gieling: i assumed he knew how to calculate the length haha
4/18/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: They are all in the sunmary on cs students, those purposes
4/18/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Just stating it to be sure
4/18/17, 13:23 - Bart van Dooren: thanks for the explenation :), i get it now
4/18/17, 13:23 - Bas Gieling: nice :)
4/18/17, 13:23 - Bart van Dooren: explanation*
4/18/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
4/18/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: think of the specification document for embedded systems
4/18/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: yeah that sort of makes sense
4/18/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
4/18/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyone know how to solve this one?
4/18/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It was explained by anne couple of messages up
4/18/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh thanks
4/18/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: here
4/18/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks
4/18/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: <Media omitted>
4/18/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: trying to resist cs-students.nl advertisement
4/18/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep ;d
4/18/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: don't get it
4/18/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: help meh
4/18/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm stuck
4/18/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: when graph derived from the derivative y' forms a peak you have a stable equilibrium
4/18/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so... when it is equal to 0?
4/18/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: can't you just say y' = 0 and get your y values that way then?
4/18/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: no because that would also include minimums
4/18/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hmmm
4/18/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how'd you go about solving it then?
4/18/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i dont even know where to start
4/18/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Just do C
4/18/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: And skip
4/18/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Dont waste time
4/18/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: U dont need 40/40
4/18/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Bro
4/18/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: that's also my tactic hakan
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Yeah
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: All questions i dont know im gonna put C
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hahahahha wth
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Maybe 2/8 will be correct
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i wanna know how to solve it though dude
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: U at uni ?
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not enough confidence to skip questions yet
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah man
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Where
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: left right
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: from stairs
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Stand up
4/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ohh
4/18/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I am left left
4/18/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dont see you
4/18/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Im behind the stairs
4/18/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ohhh
4/18/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
4/18/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: MF 5.199 anyone? :P
4/18/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31629323398 could you show me how to solve the question i asked you about?
4/18/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i have no idea
4/18/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: well ill try
4/18/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
4/18/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: do you know how the "rewrite" of the formula happens?
4/18/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: for quick reference
4/18/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i mean, its just (y-**given values**)^i right
4/18/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yes
4/18/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah i see that
4/18/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: then you look at what values y can be
4/18/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you can see that if y>0 and < 0.1 all 3 formulas(y-something) will be negative
4/18/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and the first (-y) is also negative
4/18/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: so 4 negatives makes one positive
4/18/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you try this with all equilibria 0.1 13.7 etc and all intervals in between are either positive or negative, you just have to find out
4/18/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: based on that you can sketch a graph
4/18/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and if it goes from negative to positive at an equilibrium it's unstable
4/18/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and the other way around is stable
4/18/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and any value in between will "fall"
4/18/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: to the stable point
4/18/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Or you remember the question
4/18/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Because they are lazy fucks and Will copy everything from previous exams again
4/18/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: let's hope so
4/18/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: how do we express mod 2 in Assembly. do we do AND
4/18/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: MOD
4/18/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If I recall correctly
4/18/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: yea, MOD works
4/18/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah so MOD R0 2
4/18/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
4/18/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: and there is no MOD here :<
4/18/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: AND R0 %01 also gives modulo 2
4/18/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but it only works with powers of 2
4/18/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: if you need to do mod (not a power of 2) you'd have to use the mod function
4/18/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ah okay
4/18/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: To be safe just always use the MOD function tbh
4/18/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: practically you're only reading the last digit if you use the AND %01 thing, which can only be 1 or 0 so technically modulo 2
4/18/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ill use MOD funcion
4/18/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: in this case would it be MOD R4 R0 ?
4/18/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: On oncoarse in the examfiles folder there's a file named MathTool-Formulas-Exam
4/18/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is that the formule sheet we'll be getting at the exam (or something similair)
4/18/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: instruction set summary?
4/18/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oh nvm
4/18/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No MOD R0 R4
4/18/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: modeling
4/18/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ok,

4/18/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so just.. find the answer with only stable ones?
4/18/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and what if it equates to zero?
4/18/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nvm i get it
4/18/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks @31629323398

4/18/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: So you can use them as either 1 or 0
4/18/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: does anyone know where i can find the dates for the interim tests for next quartile?
4/18/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: cant find it on osiris
4/18/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: think it is not planned yet, cause there is no date in the course information
4/18/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: what is the difference between the purposes abstraction and compression?
4/18/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Someone answer this please 😶

4/18/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Does anyone know what hours of USE will be for us/my group/ etc ?
4/18/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: since 12 hours seems like a bit much
4/18/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: So I qssume max was talking shit and it really doesn't matter which audi?
4/18/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Because 2 different answers leave me in doubt
4/18/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: watch out or I'll push you into a fence
4/18/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ohja haha
4/18/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: But I'll believe dimitar because you don't even have cs resit max
4/18/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
4/18/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Do we just reverse the sign because it is a mininum rate of change?
4/18/17, 19:37 - Bas Gieling: yea, the maximum rate of change is in the direction of (8,11), so the minimum is in the opposite of this direction, because its the same but negative
4/18/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Alright thank you
4/18/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay best way to study this shit starting now?
4/18/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did the weeklies 100/100
4/18/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Do nothing and pass
4/18/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nono, I want to make sure I did something
4/18/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: read the summary
4/18/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: do the exams
4/18/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Online tests if you really want to do some more
4/18/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: realise you can bullshit your way through the modeling process
4/18/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I can bullshit my way through more than I thought
4/18/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So far
4/18/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: likewise
4/18/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: the only downside of the given exams is that you spoil the answer by scrolling the slightest bit too far
4/18/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Just be gentle
4/18/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys
4/18/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we got grades yet?
4/18/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well I hope they do the same as for the midterm and make the exam 100% thesame as the practice questions
4/18/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Easy 10
4/18/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What she said
4/18/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I haven
4/18/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: t
4/18/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: my experience with modeling
4/18/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: there are pdfs on oncourse without answers you know?
4/18/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guys this is confusing
4/18/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/18/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: the last one is 47 pages
4/18/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 1-7 is 22 pages
4/18/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: pick your poison
4/18/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I prefer the top one
4/18/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But does it still hold the necessary info considering the lack of pages?
4/18/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah
4/18/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: filler chapters are the worst
4/18/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I think the larger one is the notes from the lecture slides
4/18/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: There just isn't that much to say
4/18/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: the top one is the most compressed one
4/18/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooeh
4/18/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I like compressed things
4/18/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: better than abstracted things?
4/18/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I do not like abstract things
4/18/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Abstract art most of all
4/18/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When I draw a circle on a filthy mess I get detention from my second grade teacher because I made a fucking mess
4/18/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And meanwhile those same paintings get sold for millions
4/18/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Where's the logic in that
4/18/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wrong chat, sorry
4/18/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: just like modeling, it's about the bullshit story you put around it
4/18/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂😂
4/19/17, 00:52 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: A friend of mine made a summary for 0LEB0, in case you like it:

4/19/17, 01:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Can I just say that that is one of the nicest looking summaries I have ever seen
4/19/17, 01:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: How can you download it though, Doc is disabled for TU/e
4/19/17, 01:11 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: I'll ask him tomorrow if he can send me a PDF version. I'll upload it on cs-students then
4/19/17, 01:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It looks so fucking good though
4/19/17, 01:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Holy shit
4/19/17, 01:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: All the nice blue term and greyed out thingies
4/19/17, 01:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He even put copyright messages in there
4/19/17, 01:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Holy crap
4/19/17, 01:12 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: hahaha he was quite well known for his summaries at high school (ask @31621372984)
4/19/17, 01:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I can imagine

4/19/17, 07:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: never failed a single test with one of his summaries
4/19/17, 07:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hope imma keep the streak up
4/19/17, 08:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wow same herr

4/19/17, 09:36 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: what exactly is "dimensional analysis"? i can not find a clear definition
4/19/17, 09:38 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: looking if your "grootheden" fall within the specified pre-defined bounds
4/19/17, 09:38 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: its als in the exam of april 2015 IIRC
4/19/17, 09:38 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: *its also

4/19/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Had that already when Q3 wasnt even finished
4/19/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And still have it i believe
4/19/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not sure Why

4/19/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But that is during the kick off...
4/19/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: where did you find the modelling location?
4/19/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: email
4/19/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: and I just sent it 2 messages ago
4/19/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: They fucked up again..
4/19/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck me
4/19/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: hall 1 in the sports center?
4/19/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'd recommend going to kickoff, because they might kick JFG out of computer systems
4/19/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and we should all be there to applaud
4/19/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: OMG REALLY
4/19/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That's awesome
4/19/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Is there a bus stopping near the sports center?
4/19/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: the one near medisch centrum is closest
4/19/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh my god no wau
4/19/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: just like they did with the calculus guy last time
4/19/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Why and how do you know this?
4/19/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: niiiiiice
4/19/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the calculus guy was good tho wasnt he
4/19/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No
4/19/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: idk, roel said they did it because of the amount of negative feedback on those questionairres they send you every quartile
4/19/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and knowing most people gave jfg low amounts of points he'll probably get kicked out
4/19/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Those questionnaires are really important
4/19/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I noticed all the feedback I put in for Programming was repeated at the kickoff
4/19/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So they actually listen
4/19/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: true
4/19/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: hence i suggested that more courses should be organised like DS
4/19/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: cause they did an amazing job in getting our grades out in 2 days for every assignment
4/19/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
4/19/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That was quite the achievement
4/19/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They did that without fail
4/19/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: daan go study
4/19/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Has anyone already mailed Arthur regarding the kickoff? It's a bit cheeky of them to use that moment as well
4/19/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Saves them a lot of students
4/19/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Where can I find the new planapp"?
4/19/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: https://osirisplanapp.tue.nl/#/
4/19/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I can't even find 2IT50 to add to year 2...
4/19/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I can't find any subjects I searched on the new plan app
4/19/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: You cant put in the @IT stuff, you have to type the full name
4/19/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: And if you go from the front page to the catalog, you have to switch between packages and cursusses to make them visible sometimes
4/19/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Well, if I search on one of the subject codes of the subjects already listed in the catalog, I can find them by using the subject name..
4/19/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: yeah, the subject code didnt work for me either
4/19/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: eh they only put in all subjects that start with an a b c or d so i dont think they are done yet
4/19/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: at least thats what i get
4/19/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Am I the only one who is getting a little bit tired from this technical difficulties Eindhoven shit?
4/19/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: you are not the only one
4/19/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: I didn't even notice the rest of the alphabet was missing
4/19/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but it is only when i ask for all the subject of mathematics and software science
4/19/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: its weird
4/19/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: I think all the packages are there though
4/19/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Don't think they are missing, only the subjhects
4/19/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, the fact is that they just shipped another incomplete system
4/19/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
4/19/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Rick go do that shit for them, they've been struggling long enough by now
4/19/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Poor souls have no clue
4/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, the systems and their ideas aren't that bad
4/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Just the implementation sucks bollocks
4/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Now I wonder, what kind of "research" do they deliver
4/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering the 50/50 division of research and teaching
4/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And the teaching part sucking balls
4/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The research is world-class, I hope you know that
4/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm just bashing :p
4/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Don't want to study for modeling
4/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: neither of those things is practical implementing so it's no wonder
4/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
4/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: u know it
4/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: first you substitute x = 0
4/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: giving you the values of 1 and -1 for y
4/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then you substitute the y = 2
4/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: which should give you the -3 and 3 for x
4/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: in f_y = 0 btw
4/19/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oki i got it

4/19/17, 12:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Pretty sure they must be correct mostly
4/19/17, 12:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Like 99to 100 % correct
4/19/17, 12:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I mean i sure do hope they are wrong but ... i doubt it
4/19/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: even though I don't expect to see that happen
4/19/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: But a slip of a finger is easily done while manually inserting like 250 numbers in one go

4/19/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: practically, yes
4/19/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Although very unlikely
4/19/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah, but the chances of that happening is really low
4/19/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: theoretically?
4/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If Speckmann entered them, they are 0
4/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Then I hope that it's correct
4/19/17, 12:11 - Bas Gieling: theoretically, yeah, practically, highly unlikely
4/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: yea, that's what I meant xd
4/19/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
4/19/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not good enough
4/19/17, 12:13 - Bas Gieling: -0.8 = -0.81 != -4/5
4/19/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Ja fuck hun dan
4/19/17, 12:14 - Bas Gieling: ja tis fucking irritant wel
4/19/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: -0.8=-0.82=-4.1/5=-4/5
4/19/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: one could argue
4/19/17, 12:16 - Bas Gieling: thats -4./5
4/19/17, 12:16 - Bas Gieling: in principe
4/19/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Im really curious now, Anne what is your DS grade?
4/19/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: Does anyone else have dbl embedded systems in his time table and no USE basis?
4/19/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31610720282
4/19/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: <Media omitted>

4/19/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Modelling report grade is also online check oncourse
4/19/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 8, which makes 9 average, gonna do the resit I think
4/19/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Have an 8 with 8.4 average 😢
4/19/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: 8.45 average man
4/19/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Just needed 0.05
4/19/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: remember: no resits
4/19/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Data struggles
4/19/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Nol what was your grade for the exam?
4/19/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: 8.0
4/19/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Damn 9 average and going to do a resit...
4/19/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: no one above 7 so far had a decimal number, it's quite interesting
4/19/17, 12:33 - Bas Gieling: 9.3 average, gonna do the resit aswell
4/19/17, 12:33 - Bas Gieling: ;D
4/19/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Hmm suspicious
4/19/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: What is wrong with you people
4/19/17, 12:34 - Bas Gieling: i had a 9,2, so i did have a decimal
4/19/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Maybe they did that because theyre too lazy and its quicker
4/19/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Yeah average right
4/19/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: also my suspicion
4/19/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 8 fuck you with your nines
4/19/17, 12:34 - Bas Gieling: no, 9,2 for the exam, 9,3 average
4/19/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: damn
4/19/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Rip theory Storm
4/19/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Oh okay
4/19/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: f
4/19/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Conspiracy averted
4/19/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: f
4/19/17, 12:35 - Bas Gieling: f
4/19/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: can there be like an app group for people that don't suck at Data structures that can complain about their 9's there? ^^'
4/19/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: no
4/19/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Let the nerd lurkers talk for once :^)
4/19/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: 7 shitposters present
4/19/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: too lazy to score high master race
4/19/17, 12:36 - Casper Smits: I'm a little bit confused by the e-mail we got from the USE departement. It says that I am enrolled in preference group number 4 (Healthcare Robots), but I have not choosen this option in any of the four slots. Is this normal?
4/19/17, 12:37 - Bas Gieling: "high" is relative here
4/19/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Check on osiris
4/19/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: >7.5
4/19/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Look at "remark"
4/19/17, 12:38 - Bas Gieling: fair enough
4/19/17, 12:38 - Casper Smits: it says "mobility group 4"
4/19/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Someone using Linux that also is unable to load Osiris?
4/19/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Mine says ICT, block 4, group 4, DS2 (=data sharing)
4/19/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Yes
4/19/17, 12:40 - Casper Smits: mine says SDC4
4/19/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: =Self driving cars
4/19/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Only Firefox does not work for me though, Chromium does.
4/19/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh, alright I'll try chromium
4/19/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Idk what the number means though
4/19/17, 12:41 - Casper Smits: aah alright thank you! The email we got is quite confusing ^^"
4/19/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Np hard
4/19/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So, in the new osiris planapp thing, are the elective packages just gone ? Or is there a way I can order all those courses on package or whatever?
4/19/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Where does it say that?
4/19/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Nvm got it
4/19/17, 12:56 - Casper Smits: osiris > register > overview registrations > row: 0SAB0C; column: remark
4/19/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: What would DS1 be?
4/19/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thanks
4/19/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I guess data sharing
4/19/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Data sharing was my third choice..
4/19/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: im gonna fucking wait until they fix this shitty thing before I choose my shit
4/19/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Osiris is bad
4/19/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: And they should feel bad
4/19/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Fuckin agreed
4/19/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: immediately
4/19/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did no one catch this awesome reference?
4/19/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah you should feel bad for having an average 9
4/19/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Shame on you
4/19/17, 13:30 - Bas Gieling: MARCUS
4/19/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You might wanna add an /s here for the people who don't get it
4/19/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: <Media omitted>
4/19/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nope
4/19/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You know x = 5 or x = 7 so you pick number before and after those which yields, 5, 6 and 8. You fill those in into the formule and that yields 3, -1, 3 so it goes down and up. If something goes down it is stable and if it goes up is is unstable
4/19/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: (y-5)(y-7) is correct
4/19/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's not a difficult sentence
4/19/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: but the formula it says +35 and in the answer they are using -35
4/19/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, that is just the typo
4/19/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: they work it out correctly
4/19/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah that's a typo indeed but they used the correct formula
4/19/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I know, it's stupid
4/19/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You bet your ass it is
4/19/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂 no seriously, are you still going for the 10?
4/19/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yeah, probably, because I know it's possible
4/19/17, 13:44 - Bas Gieling: she only has to get a 9,2
4/19/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Dayum
4/19/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Obviously
4/19/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: wait no
4/19/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: a 8.2 right?
4/19/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: you had a 9.8 for the assignments right?
4/19/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: oh wait nvm
4/19/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂 how did calculus go Sander
4/19/17, 13:46 - Bas Gieling: xD
4/19/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: ven or bruin?
4/19/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: If its meant for me: shut up
4/19/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 😂
4/19/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: hahah
4/19/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I had a 8 I think Daan

4/19/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: where can i find the slides of modeling
4/19/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: do i have to watch lectures
4/19/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lol

4/19/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: is there an official one?
4/19/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I heard the Aaron one is good
4/19/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I don't think so
4/19/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: its good
4/19/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Aaron's one is good yea

4/19/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i will i just wanted to see cycler example
4/19/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: and if you really want to go all in then you can also make all the oncourse exercises
4/19/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: See Example: the speed of a cyclist from the slides
of Chapter 6.
4/19/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Doing the practise exams is the most usefull though
4/19/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Atleast it was for me
4/19/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: past exams u mean
4/19/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: or tests on oncourse
4/19/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: both
4/19/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: oncourse is per topic which is nice
4/19/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but they are from exams aswell
4/19/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Past exams i ment, but thats mostly because of the math questions on there, for the theory the questions in the past tests or oncource arent that different
4/19/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: is there a formula sheet given in exam
4/19/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: for modeling there is
4/19/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: are you shitting me

4/19/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: would use the fomula sheet with some excersices just to be sure you understand it
4/19/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jesus that makes life easier
4/19/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: this does not help for every math excercise

4/19/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: 40 multiple choice questions that account for 90% of your final test grade right?
4/19/17, 15:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ye
4/19/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: that's how it's mentioned everywhere, so yea
4/19/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: we fill in x with 1 but whats with y
4/19/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: what do i fill y wth
4/19/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: with*
4/19/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: do i choose a value for y too
4/19/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: um, you should really be more specific about what youre asking, i have no clue at the moment namely
4/19/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is this about the question you asked earlier?
4/19/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: diz
4/19/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yes
4/19/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if so, just fucking choose some random coordinates (i.e. (0,0), that's the easiest) and look in the graphs which one matches the slope you got
4/19/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it doesnt matter what coordinates you choose
4/19/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I always just look at (0,0)
4/19/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its the easiest
4/19/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah oki
4/19/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: are the company visits friday mandatory?
4/19/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: yes
4/19/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: I hear people saying no
4/19/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: Yeah thats why i was wondering
4/19/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: in the presentation giving by bloo at the beginning of the year it says its mandatory
4/19/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah else no one goes
4/19/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They don't check anything
4/19/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But you should go, it's a nice opportunity
4/19/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's free, includes lunch and informative
4/19/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wellll
4/19/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am still doubting whether I should go
4/19/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: we have the day off anyway
4/19/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: what else would you do
4/19/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Sleep
4/19/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: game
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: go back to my parents place
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: not wake up at 6 o clock in the morning
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: fair point
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I am only going to the morning one because that one has my interest, and includes lunch
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: There are a lot of other things you could do
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: for a company visit i honestly dont care about
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: if you go to a company that seems interesting, then it's a nice opportunity
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: excactly intel was the only interesting one for me and that one was full within the hour
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's about creating connections
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's why they let you choose for yourself
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I'm lucky then with intel :D
4/19/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
4/19/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: yeah if i got intel i wouldve gone no doubt
4/19/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i get the min and max
4/19/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: the 5 is there to make sure that if there is no problem, the function evaluates to 0
4/19/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: so if the size is correct we dont get a positive answer
4/19/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: when should we subtract 5 and from 5 🤔
4/19/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: if the size is correct then answer A will give a positive number as output
4/19/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: but it should give 0
4/19/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 5 is there to make sure the function gives 0?
4/19/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: if the lenght is correct
4/19/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: yes
4/19/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: so fill in some correct numbers and see if it gives 0
4/19/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: <Media omitted>
4/19/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah I wondered that for some questions in the weeklies as well
4/19/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You get those numbers
4/19/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What they give you the factorization?
4/19/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Ohh now I see
4/19/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: It's kind of hidden in the text, they're the equilibrium solutions
4/19/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No they gave a formula after the -y and the number 0.1, 13.7 and 36
4/19/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: That makes this whole type of question a lot easier
4/19/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
4/19/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oh nvm
4/19/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i got ittttttt
4/19/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay I always get confused with these questions, so is there a general approach? (image follows)
4/19/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/19/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: since there seem to be equations for tangent lines to planes, tangent planes to lines, to points blablabla
4/19/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I cannot keep them apart
4/19/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I got you on this one
4/19/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: See private message
4/19/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: thanks!
4/19/17, 17:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, could somebody please give an example how you would've answered the open questions for exam of 2016?
4/19/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I don't even know what they are hinting at, so I second this question
4/19/17, 20:16 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
4/19/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: you want to minimize P and maximize Q
4/19/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so you want the graph that keeps P small for as long as possible, while Q is growing
4/19/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Basically where the graph is curving the most

4/19/17, 20:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: eeeeh ? can you elaborate it sorry my brain had a fart
4/19/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: y'(previous x)*
4/19/17, 20:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :{
4/19/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: sorry meant that
4/19/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I thought so, just trying tot prevent confusion  😅

4/19/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Previous step is y(0) so x=0
4/19/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Next step uses this step so then it uses y(0.1) -> x=0.1

4/19/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: could someone explain this one? 🙃
4/19/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: The way I do it is that I get the gradient and treat it as a vector then get its magnitude but I do not understand why it works tbh
4/19/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: This yields a maximum so I put a negative sign to let it be a minimum
4/19/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: lel
4/19/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: will do it also like that then
4/19/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: thank you
4/19/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ?
4/19/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: can someone answer this id like to know
4/19/17, 21:51 - Bas Gieling: you get the gradient
4/19/17, 21:51 - Bas Gieling: minimum is in the negative direction of the gradient
4/19/17, 21:51 - Bas Gieling: but you gotta do inner product with a unit vector, so length 1
4/19/17, 21:52 - Bas Gieling: so you divide by sqrt(13)
4/19/17, 21:53 - Bas Gieling: so you do gradient inner product with the negative of the gradient to find the minimum, but the vector you do the inner product with must be a unit vector of length 1, so you have to divide this vector by sqrt(13), as that is its length
4/19/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Keep it serious
4/19/17, 21:56 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Oh yeah
4/19/17, 21:56 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: thanks @31627446682 !
4/19/17, 21:56 - Bas Gieling: np :p
4/19/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: cant you just like
4/19/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: do pythagoras with the x andby coord
4/19/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and make it negative
4/19/17, 22:01 - Bas Gieling: that comes down to the same thing
4/19/17, 23:11 - Luke Houben: <Media omitted>
4/19/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Fill in the x-values
4/19/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And then compare them
4/19/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The highest is/are a maximum, the lowest is/are a minimum
4/19/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Them --> f(x)
4/19/17, 23:12 - Luke Houben: Ah ofc, i'm stupid
4/19/17, 23:12 - Luke Houben: Thanks!
4/19/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: guys for the open question, are u supposed to answer the question on behalf of ur model?
4/19/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes
4/19/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: thanks!

4/19/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why?
4/19/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Dont know what my model is about
4/19/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Dude 😂
4/19/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Didn't you work on it for like 8 weeks
4/19/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: please refer to the video I posted in the spam chat to see how we did our project
4/20/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Where in sportcenter can I find hall 1 for the modelling exam again? Or is it the same one as for the calculus exam in Q1?
4/20/17, 00:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah its the big hall
4/20/17, 00:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Enter go left go left again then go right then right again and only forward

4/20/17, 00:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: If my directions dont make much sence look for a sign there is allways a sign at every crossway
4/20/17, 00:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes the same one
4/20/17, 00:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: The hall with the negative temperature
4/20/17, 00:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Where i froze to death during calc
4/20/17, 00:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Seriously its cold as fuck there

4/20/17, 07:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So study at home?😂
4/20/17, 07:39 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Can't home is noisy in the morning
4/20/17, 07:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 👆🏽 i get this
4/20/17, 07:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: studying at the tu is so much better than at home for some people
4/20/17, 07:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: (including me)
4/20/17, 07:39 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And the roads are better
4/20/17, 07:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I went to the tu for the past 3 weeks every day except for easter
4/20/17, 07:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because learning there is just so much more useful
4/20/17, 07:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: than at home
4/20/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: when will the DBL marks be released?
4/20/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: or at least, when do we know the grades for it?
4/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Within 3 weeks from monday last week
4/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: okay, thanks!
4/20/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: We got our grade just now! But I think it depends on the tutor?
4/20/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: how'd you recieve it?
4/20/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: mail, osiris?
4/20/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: We recieved an email from our tutor! #theo
4/20/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: well, I've got nothing
4/20/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: For Embedded Systems, how many OGO blocks/hours  do you have each week? My timetable says I have 4 OGO blocks of 4 hour each?
4/20/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You have 3 of 4 hours iirc
4/20/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But you are free to reschedule as a group, for example, we didn't meet on friday
4/20/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Ahhh okay thanks! ^^
4/20/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: A concept represents An entity right guys?😂
4/20/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I sincerely hope so
4/20/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Our group got dbl grade

4/20/17, 15:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So its unofficial

4/20/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Of want
4/20/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: What
4/20/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Dbl?
4/20/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Omg
4/20/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I passed jeej
4/20/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nice
4/20/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I dont have shit yet
4/20/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What.. you have an entity of a concept
4/20/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just like an entity of a Java class
4/20/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So the other way around I'd guess
4/20/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: A concept is for example a chair
4/20/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And if you take a chair with red legs you have an entity of the class/concept chair with the propertie of legcolor having the value red
4/20/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: I thought the same thing as you Daan, but I think in modelling it'a actually the other way around
4/20/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: it's*
4/20/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You're kidding I hope... :/
4/20/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It is
4/20/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What is an entity then? Since a concept is still the same idea as a class
4/20/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You have An entity that you want to work with
4/20/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: And you make a concept of it
4/20/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ...
4/20/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Kill those people
4/20/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh wait.. hehehe
4/20/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That was basic chapter 1
4/20/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah I just reasoned through the exam with logical thinking
4/20/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But of course this does not work for modeling
4/20/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Programmer bait question haha
4/20/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well yeah why make it hard if it shouldn't be right
4/20/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Datastructures is a hard course because it has a lot of difficult material
4/20/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For modeling they were like okay this is such a joke in itself that we need to fuck it up in order to let people fail here and there
4/20/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I honestly have no idea what we did for our model while we all worked on it for eight weeks and still we got an 8.3
4/20/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It does not even do what it exactly should
4/20/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pretty sure we spoke against ourselves quite some times
4/20/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: We didn't have an idea what we were doing and got a 4.9 😅
4/20/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wait what
4/20/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: you failed the model?
4/20/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Does that mean you failed the course..?
4/20/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I hope not
4/20/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No 5.0 rule like at the exam?
4/20/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: I don't think so
4/20/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Otherwise the tutor would be a dick
4/20/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: not the tutor
4/20/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The supervisor gives the final grades
4/20/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Tutor has no say in them
4/20/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Thats why I meant to type
4/20/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ahh
4/20/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: What*
4/20/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Pretty sure you need a 5.0 for the modeling report
4/20/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: So yeah that would for sure be a dickmove
4/20/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wow fuck
4/20/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That would be one asshole supervisor
4/20/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You don't need a 5.0 for modeling report
4/20/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Can anyone confirm the 5.0 for the report?
4/20/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: afaik
4/20/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ah thanks Nick
4/20/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Doesn't say that anywhere
4/20/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Just looked through the studyguide
4/20/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And it does say that for the exam right?
4/20/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: <Media omitted>
4/20/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah

4/21/17, 08:10 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: This is what they said but idk where exactly in the science park I should be
4/21/17, 08:12 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: maps.google.com
4/21/17, 08:16 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I know how to go to the science park 
I was just wondering where exactly should i be in order 4 the transport provided by tue to pick me up
4/21/17, 08:25 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: I think they mean you have to be at Prodrive, which is somewhere at the Science Park. The transport from Prodrive to CM will probably be mentioned later or in plain sight when it gets there.
4/21/17, 08:53 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Anyone else already at prodrive?
4/21/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Omw there now
4/21/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: In bus 406

4/21/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: From the bus stop
4/21/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: ?
4/21/17, 09:00 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Yes just look at google maps
4/21/17, 09:01 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Did we need to bring anything btw?

4/21/17, 09:01 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Try to find a way through the building tho, I walked all the way around
4/21/17, 09:01 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Nope
4/21/17, 09:01 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Nice
4/21/17, 09:01 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Through the buildings*
4/21/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Ah i get what you mean
4/21/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
4/21/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: <Media omitted>
4/21/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: nice one
4/21/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: is that USE, Automata, or HTI? 😅
4/21/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Automata
4/21/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: How do we know in which tutorgroup we're in?
4/21/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: There are two groups tutored by Bloo himself
4/21/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Canvas group
4/21/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: In the app goto groups instead of course
4/21/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ah i see
4/21/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Thank u
4/21/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Does someone know where you can find the USE schedule?
4/22/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
4/22/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yes, that course doesn't exist anymore I believe
4/22/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: They changed that one to like a project thing right
4/22/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Sort of end project or something, to apply the things you've learned in the previous courses of security
4/22/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But I might be wrong tho
4/22/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: okay...
4/22/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/22/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/22/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: cause fuck you that's why
4/22/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it's the way html calculates the length
4/22/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: int is slightly longer than text
4/22/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: use css to adjust it:input {
    width: 100%;
}
4/22/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: or whatever width you'd like
4/22/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh thanks, gonna try that haha
4/22/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you can make them as fancy as you want: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp ^.^
4/22/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It isn't even taught this year, I chose it and they told me to choose Digital Security Engineering instead
4/22/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 🙃
4/22/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Digital Security Engineering is only writing reports and having 2 hours of non-mandatory lectures every week btw
4/22/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Eujjjj
4/22/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Free esc you mean?
4/22/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
4/22/17, 12:31 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: how do you access the new plan app ? clicking on it from the mytue home page sends me to the old one
4/22/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: planapp.tue.nl?
4/22/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or is that the old one
4/22/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: https://osirisplanapp.tue.nl/#/plan/schedule
4/22/17, 12:35 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: thanks
4/22/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
4/22/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Is this correct?
4/22/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: If you're not planning to be in TU/e buildings, yes. Otherwise, TU/e is closed on Kingsday.
4/22/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: And the day after...? Should that also be a day off
4/22/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: So the lecture that's on there for 0SAB0A, we don't have to go?
4/22/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No you dont
4/22/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Because TU/e is closed
4/22/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: So the plan app is functional ?
4/22/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it load, yes
4/22/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but some subject are not updated. for example 2IW80 got replaced by 2IX20 (or the other way around), as it requires you to have 2IW whilst the old and now apparently less shit planapp shows you should have 2IX20. And 2IW80 is no longer taught after Q3 of this year
4/22/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and it duplicates HTI in next quartile for some fucked up reason
4/22/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For me it only loads in this year as well
4/22/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Would have to manually add every subject for second and third year myself
4/22/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it's the most cancerous piece of shit the tue has ever produced after osiris
4/22/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'm actually using the old planapp to plan my studies. then copy it to the new thing to please the exam comitteee
4/22/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 22540209‬: If it only loads in this year, you can create a new concept with both exam programmes
4/22/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 22540209‬: The propedeuse and bachelor are separate
4/22/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
4/22/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
4/22/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They are so good with technical stuff at Technical University Eindhoven
4/22/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'm just gonna mail co@gewis.nl if they could fiz it
4/22/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Have any DBL groups tutored by mr. Huberts got their grade already?
4/22/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Is that Stefan ?
4/22/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Some old guy, T.P.M.M. Huberts
4/22/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Then I don't know
4/22/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 83411377‬: Nah we don't have either
4/22/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: you can now see on oncourse how many multiplechoice questions you had correct of the modelling exam
4/22/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 22/40 leeeel
4/22/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: perfect
4/22/17, 18:01 - Bas Gieling: yea was about to say that too
4/22/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: rip me
4/22/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: 25 so that is at least a 5.0 right?
4/22/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Where can one see it?
4/22/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: It just says - for me... That means they haven't graded mine yet right?
4/22/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Yes you need 0.55555*40 questions right for a 5
4/22/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Without open
4/22/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: You need to scroll to the bottom
4/22/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: The one with (Real)
4/22/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Which is 22.2222 for those wondering
4/22/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: Oh nice ty found it
4/22/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I still have -/40

4/22/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Look further than your nose is long
4/22/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 22 fuck yes
4/22/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 4.9 without open questions 😉
4/22/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: like ur unable to get .5 pt
4/22/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Dude, on mobile I need to be fucking Pinocchio reading out trump's campaign to see that
4/22/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: from the open questions
4/22/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Well. I hope my bullshit is sufficient
4/22/17, 18:10 - Bas Gieling: 😂😂
4/22/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ofc
4/22/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: 😂😂😂
4/22/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: or else just complain about the half pt and say that this subject is dead anyway
4/22/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Hey guys! Anyone knows the schedule for USE ethics and where to find study guide?
4/22/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I got 17/40 which means I have failed the exam regardless of my open questions :(
4/22/17, 18:19 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I got 21/40 but have to get a 6.1, also impossible
4/22/17, 18:22 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: 12/40 looooooll
4/22/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: It says scale 0-100, is that scale correct?
4/22/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Nope
4/22/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Nice ☺
4/22/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Btw is there an option to improve your report and hand it in again to get some extra points?
4/22/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: No
4/22/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You had the past 7 weeks for that
4/22/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I dont think its possible
4/22/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There were three check moments for that :p
4/22/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Got a 5.9 the first two weeks and ended up with a 4.9, we didn't expect that low of a grade
4/22/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Our tutor gave us the impression is was decent, but I think the supervisor certainly did not agree with her
4/22/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Went 6/6 till now now 7/9 if we managed to get dbl sufficient
4/22/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Courses passed you mean?
4/22/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait you failed DS? :0

4/22/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 83411377‬: Nah man
4/22/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: How do you calculate your modeling grade, assuming you have all your open questions wrong
4/22/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Like, just with my multiple choice answers
4/22/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: x/40*9/10
4/22/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Alright thanks :)
4/22/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But why tho, how do they calculate the whole grade then ?
4/22/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: 20/40 livin on the edge
4/22/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: x/40*9 is it btw
4/22/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: what grade is a pass? 5 or 5.5?
4/22/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: 5
4/22/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 4.95 = 5?
4/22/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ye I figured ;)
4/22/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Don't think so
4/22/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: don't they round to the first decimal?
4/22/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Well idk
4/22/17, 19:23 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I think it is a 5
4/22/17, 19:23 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: 4.945 isn't i think
4/22/17, 19:24 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: let's just hope anything in the open questions is worth credit
4/22/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Tue back at it again: ds inspection and kickoff are both in the break on monday
4/22/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nol back at it again: repeating something that is discussed a couple of days ago
4/22/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Haha no sorry, you're right
4/22/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They fucked up
4/22/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I think someone mailed arthur about it though?
4/22/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: What is the difference between 'DS1' and 'DS2' for USE?
4/22/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Or 'SOM1' and 'SOM2', how do you know which one you are?
4/22/17, 20:16 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: why is use not on the schedule on mytue?
4/22/17, 20:17 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: i have not heard anything of that subject except that i am registered for it

4/22/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Because the email says 4 and osiris 2
4/22/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: there is no oncourse or canvas page either
4/22/17, 20:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: guys how do I check for which 3 use stuff I registered

4/22/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is that enough?
4/22/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: for the modeling exam
4/22/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: /40*
4/22/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah
4/22/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: More than

4/22/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we did it mom
4/22/17, 22:45 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: You can have a 0.1 in uni right?
4/22/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Yes
4/22/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Why Luuk?
4/22/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: If you managed to get a 0.1 for modeling that would be actually impressive
4/23/17, 01:14 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: No no, I misread something
4/23/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Does anyone know how to find what USE group you're in?
4/23/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It should say so on osiris
4/23/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Found it
4/23/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nice ;D
4/23/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Had to click on "de-register" as counterintuitive as that sounds
4/23/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: why can you see only one year in the planapp?
4/23/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: You have to choose PB and B as second option
4/23/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: where can you do that?
4/23/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: New concept and then there are two boxes, choose PB in the first one and then B in the second one
4/23/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Propedeuse and Bachelor are separate
4/23/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: ok thanks @
4/23/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: very strange it works in this way though..
4/23/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: No problemo
4/23/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Yeah had the same struggle
4/23/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: i can plan 2IW80 only in quartile 3 of this year
4/23/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Yeah it's changed to 2IXsomething
4/23/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you can change it to 2IX, but then planapp will bitch about you not having 2IW
4/23/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They just fucked up bigtime with the new plan app imho
4/23/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: why is everyone fucking with the planapp so much
4/23/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: is something important happening?
4/23/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you kinda need to plan your major before 19th of may
4/23/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but even without the issues plannap is providing, it's still pretty challenging as you need to cmpl with their requirements whilst still doing the subjects you like
4/23/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: meh you can change at any time without too much effort
4/23/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: puzzles!
4/23/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: What's wrong with the planapp?
4/23/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: So far everything works for me
4/23/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: What isn't
4/23/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And it's easy to use
4/23/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: I can't open it
4/23/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: I had Osaboa in the row with subject to be added and already planned in the general osabo, so I removed the general one (with both timeslots) and added in the A version and now I can't compile because I'm missing one of the basic subject.

4/23/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Pick security
4/23/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And you'll see the courses?

4/23/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They handed those out at the check your match event, but it would be more convenient if they updated this page with all the packages and their flyers https://educationguide.tue.nl/programs/bachelor-college/elective-courses/a-z-electives/#top
4/23/17, 16:58 - Dennis Gubbels: Does anyone know where I can find the schedule for the USE course?

4/23/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Should we just ignore all 2IO70 subjects in the timetable? That is embedded systems right?
4/23/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: 2IO70 is embedded systems yea,a nd we should probably ignore that

4/24/17, 08:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Not homework
4/24/17, 08:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I think you have to make them before
4/24/17, 08:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But one of those says interem test
4/24/17, 08:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Emphasizing on _think_
4/24/17, 08:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How can you do that as homework
4/24/17, 08:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thats nu logic
4/24/17, 08:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: My*
4/24/17, 08:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No idea
4/24/17, 08:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I don't really see the point of doing subject questions before even having intro lecture on the subject
4/24/17, 08:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well there's a whole pdf with like 3 pages of info you had to read as well
4/24/17, 08:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If you read that you we're able to make the exercises
4/24/17, 08:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I was not
4/24/17, 08:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what pdf rubain
4/24/17, 08:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Thus you have questions about them.. I don't see what the fucking problem is guys
4/24/17, 08:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
4/24/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's not mandatory
4/24/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's only to help you pass your studies
4/24/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Your choice
4/24/17, 08:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: *Obama out*
4/24/17, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but is it supposed to be made IN the tutorials or beforehand
4/24/17, 09:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well making it before hand would be the better option ofcoarse.. But hey if you don't have like 20 minutes for that just look at them and sit around
4/24/17, 09:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's your choice
4/24/17, 09:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ruben calm down jeez
4/24/17, 09:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: just wondering what we're gonna do in the tutorials
4/24/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's triggering me that people are actually wondering if you have to spend like 20-30 mins before a lecture on something if you need to ask yourself that you should ask yourself wtf you're doing anyways.
4/24/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I think we'll discuss the exercises in the tutorials
4/24/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So either way you're fine but when you made them already / took a look at them already you probably will understand a lot more and be able to do more shit
4/24/17, 09:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lol Ruben brings it a bit blunt but he is right
4/24/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Yeah well he may be right
4/24/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but still
4/24/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: there's better ways to put it
4/24/17, 09:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Sure there are better ways but seeing how you guys kept asking that approach didn't seem to be very effective
4/24/17, 09:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
4/24/17, 09:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Don't act like you don't have a spine :p
4/24/17, 09:52 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Did you guys know that swans can be gay
4/24/17, 09:52 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: That beautiful
4/24/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And very agressive
4/24/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Maybe they're constantly fighting for gay swan rights
4/24/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😏
4/24/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or they're fighting because one of them is gay
4/24/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You never know
4/24/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Beating up the gay one?
4/24/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Guys plz
4/24/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: How do I know which tutorial from automata is the correct one for me? Or do I have to go to both ?
4/24/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah.
4/24/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Both times

4/24/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyway, for the people who have HTI and dont want to be informed of information via handy groupchats: the kickoff meeting for HTI tomorrow starts a 9:45, not at 8:45
4/24/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: that is true tho
4/24/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: didnt see that excuses maques
4/24/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: It's annoying af though
4/24/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: We need to build our own app for this purpose
4/24/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: With bloojack and hookers
4/24/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I'm confused af now
4/24/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: HTI canvas tells us the thing will start at 9:45
4/24/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: wait wat
4/24/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: but the win tue site thing tell us the thing will start at 8:45
4/24/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: just trust the HTI canvas nick
4/24/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: they probably cant plan a meeting for just 1 hour
4/24/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so thats why it shows as 2 hours prob
4/24/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyway, take this convo to the HTI chat
4/24/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: <Media omitted>
4/24/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: <Media omitted>
4/24/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Not everyone is taking every elective so to keep this chat as closely related to the core of the  study for everyone, I think its better to have all the major subjects in this chat and all electives in other group chats but that's just my opinion though
4/24/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 👆🏽
4/24/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: WHAT THE FUCK
4/24/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/24/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/24/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
4/24/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: So by the end of q2 in our second year the only purpose for this chat is to send links to other chats for the electives as everyone takes subjects at different timez
4/24/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is that a problem?
4/24/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Am I doing wrong here when buying the book from Bol.com? I want the English version and it appears to be English, but Bol says it is Dutch
4/24/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we had seperate chats for fundamentals and computer graphics, why it this suddenly such a big problem
4/24/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm gonna write Billy an angry message
4/24/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Those worked quite well for detailed assignments actually
4/24/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because last period people found out at the end they were there all along
4/24/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but the active people already knew it and that's whom it's for
4/24/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: John didn't know
4/24/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ah lol
4/24/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'd tag john as active
4/24/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: good point hahahah
4/24/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: exactly. And I don't think you fundamentals plebs wouldve liked us arguing about the stance of our robots in the assignments 24/7 in q2 in this chat
4/24/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: *you fundamentals people
4/24/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I most certainly would not
4/24/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: That could be true and maybe we should invest in making an platform for communication for the subjects
4/24/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: sorry
4/24/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: my phone automatically translates fundamentals people to plebs
4/24/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Cs-students is looking into it
4/24/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: It's difficult, but not impossible

4/24/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Update: The book "Engineering the future, understanding the past" on Bol.com shows up there as being Dutch, but the employees told me it is actually a mistake and it is the book we need
4/24/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We do not need the other book until the fifth week right?
4/24/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is there no available pdfs of ti?

4/24/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Honestly doing a clean install will solve a lot of shit
4/24/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I know the question is serious but the responses aren't
4/24/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well not a friendly one at least

4/24/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You need a USB drive, their program and a windows key
4/24/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Everything will be done for you
4/24/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah but you also need to backup your files beforehand

4/24/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I always laugh at people who lose files because they did not back them up at least once. Even my little sister knows that results in problems if you don't
4/24/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But @31621372984 , Google "windows 10 live USB" and press the first Microsoft link
4/24/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You'll need a USB drive of more than 4 GB and your windows key

My answer will just be "ask the people who did buy it" from now on

4/24/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: SSD is way more volatile than a HDD so I prefer that as backup for data, and since SSD gets way slower when getting full you need a larger one

4/24/17, 20:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So here is what happens. Florian buys book and gives it to us for abismaly small amount. We gladly donate since its cheaper and we are students feelsbadman. Then florian makes bug profit and we dont mind it because we didt pay a lot. On the flipside the book publisher gets ripped of and looses money. Aaaaand the cicle continues 🤠🤑
4/24/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: well
4/24/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: since we post it on cs-students

4/24/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so future generations don't need to buy anything
4/24/17, 20:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah but the cicle continues with other books
4/24/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yup
4/24/17, 20:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So eventualy nobody will make books 😂
4/24/17, 20:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Because cs students will be pirate bay for study stuff
4/24/17, 20:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: LOL DENUVO FOR BOOKS !
4/24/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: then maybe they'll realize that they need to give pdf for free anyway

4/24/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: whom should we mail for the new planapp? mine isnt working at all.
4/24/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Maybe we can provide some help
4/24/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I've figured most of it out by now
4/24/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Although it is still very inconvenient and unclear tbh
4/24/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: if I search the subject code: nada
if I search the subject name: nana

4/24/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: there we go again with the weekly tests
4/24/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: tried different subjects to be sure
4/24/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: On top there are two tabs one for coherente pakketen and one for subject
4/24/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: subjects*
4/24/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: When you're not in subjects searching for either subject codes or names won't work
4/24/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: i only have courses
4/24/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: not pakketen
4/24/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh wait you first need to add an bachelor
4/24/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll make a guide on cs-students for this shit
4/24/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
4/24/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: this is what i have
4/24/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: When creating a new concept there are two boxes where you can choose your study
4/24/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: In the first one you have to choose the PB
4/24/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: And in the second one B
4/24/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Which stand for Propedeuse and Bachelor
4/24/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: that did something let me check
4/24/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Maybe the shortcuts on the left of the page of cs students need to be updated?
4/24/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/questions/15990818/how-to-use-the-new-planapp

4/24/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Did they explain at the kick off what you have to do for the P exam except registration, or is that everything?
4/24/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I believe registration is everything
4/24/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Then they automatically check If you match the requirements
4/24/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If So you get ur P
4/24/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: you need to pass every first year course
4/24/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah But ofc Anne passes every course dummy 😘
4/24/17, 21:39 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: guys for hti tomorrow is it 8:45 or 9:45? canvas says 9:45, studyguide and mytimetable say 8:45
4/24/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: i think 8:45
4/24/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I mailed the teacher about it
4/24/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: no response so far
4/24/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: they don't have an email for the course afaik, that's why I decided to mail him
4/24/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: only canvas says 9:45 but they refer there to the 'studeerwijzer' which says 8:45
4/24/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: yeah but on the top of the win.tue.nl thing it says that all the information is on canvas as well
4/24/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: so i think that canvas is just a typo
4/24/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: yeah could be
4/24/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: okay then i guess it is 8:45
4/24/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Canvas 9:45, mytimetable 8:45
4/24/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I go for canvas
4/24/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: They can't blame you for going there at 9:45 anyway
4/24/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Mytimetable only goes per 2 hours is my guess
4/24/17, 21:51 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: hmm that could also be true
4/24/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: seems legit
4/24/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For Hypermedia, which had the same teachers and course structure afaik, we only had 1 hour of introduction lecture as well the first time
4/24/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The same setup as it is here
4/24/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So my bet goes to 09:45 as well
4/24/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
4/24/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Doesnt matter i assume
4/24/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: We had only one room and social media and data sharing was together
4/24/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: In de blauwe zaal
4/24/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Oh sorry i thought this was about hti
4/24/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: No that's ok 
I guess i will go aud 10
4/24/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Probably 1 normal room and 2 doorlus
4/24/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Maybe 👍🏻
4/25/17, 08:07 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: for all people who have HTI there is a group chat:

4/25/17, 08:32 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Computational science where?
4/25/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: Just out of curiosity, could someone tell me where the mobility SDC group for USE was supposed to have lectures?!
4/25/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: Cause i sure couldn't figure it out by myself
4/25/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: dont worry
4/25/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: it'll be online
4/25/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: the lectures at least
4/25/17, 10:39 - Casper Smits: Paviljoen B1
4/25/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: Thanks, I just realised I just watched a random lecture after 2 hours...
4/25/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice hahahhahahah
4/25/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: gg filippo
4/25/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: <Media omitted>
4/25/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: Also, I'm sorry if this has been discussed before but is it normal that on my time table there's no mention of lectures or tutorial hours anywhere for USE?
4/25/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: I'm at a loss here
4/25/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: What time slot? I have A and had my lecture Monday it is on my timetable
4/25/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: I have C as far as I can tell from osiris
4/25/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: I mean the intro lecture was there I'm just missing everything else
4/25/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
4/25/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I have this but again I have A so for C I don't know but tutorials are there for me as far as I can tel
4/25/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Tell
4/25/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: Yeah I'll have to email them about it, it's been like trying to get into a secret society for me ffs
4/25/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is it true that the planapp does not tell if timeslots conflict anymore?
4/25/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It does
4/25/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But only when verifying your program
4/25/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Is there a limit on the amount of time tue people may take to grade reports?
4/25/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
4/25/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 15 workdays for everything
4/25/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Everything that adds up to the final grade*
4/25/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: So embedded systems will be somewhere next week because of kingsday?
4/25/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is actually in some Dutch law for academic institutions so it can be enforced
4/25/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes kingsday and easter delays these things
4/25/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Ah okay
4/25/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: When is DBL supposed to finish?
4/25/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Be finished*
4/25/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I guess next friday for sure
4/25/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
4/25/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: C
4/25/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Can't remember exactly why tho
4/25/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Transition relation is that for every state there is atleast 1 outgoing arrow and a fuction is that there is for every state an outgoing arrow for every possible action
4/25/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If im correct
4/25/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: The scheme does not define what happens when you're in state 1 and receive symbol 1 for instance
4/25/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: And a DFA has a fuction
4/25/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: So that is basically my reason why it is not a dfa just different terminology ?
4/25/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Yup
4/25/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yes thank you everyone ! :)
4/25/17, 18:39 - Luke Houben: About the video lectures:
I've uploaded them to CS-Students server, they can be found at http://web.cs-students.nl/ . Nothing fancy, but we'll see if our bandwidth is high enough to stream the videos. If Questions gets really slow we will disable the videos though
4/25/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: What is the reason to mirror the video lectures, i got good downloading speeds on the win tue server
4/25/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Probs the idea is to have everything in one place
4/25/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But Idk
4/25/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't even get why they're not up for streaming on videocollege and such
4/25/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ?
4/25/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Videocollege has horrific bitrates so I'm happy it's not on there
4/25/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wait you have to download em?
4/25/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I heard its like 28 gigs Lol?
4/25/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: You can stream them from the canvas page, tbh I prefer it how this course handles video lectures, having the video files locally and playing them in VLC or whatever you is better than having to use the video college site,
4/25/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: True
4/25/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: The videocollege site is a mess imo
4/25/17, 21:08 - Kevin Jilissen: Probably that not everyone wants to enable the security leak called Flash Player
4/25/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is true, I could even agree on that now that I think of it
4/25/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: I don't have flash player in my Firefox and I was able to stream them
4/25/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Can play them in train as well this way
4/25/17, 21:09 - Kevin Jilissen: <Media omitted>
4/25/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: It is 20GB on your SSD but you can always move them to an archive at home or download them in batches whenever you finished a chapter
4/25/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL, I now have a point with my second HDD discussion two days ago
4/25/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: DAAN STFU
4/25/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: FFS
4/25/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not the topic
4/25/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Kevin, I do not even have flash installed on my pc. Maybe that is the problem that is sees you have flash so it tries to serve the flash player. And then your browser blocks it until you activate it
4/25/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Why would i care about using flash player?
4/25/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering you leave John alone with your laptop you do not care about malware so you shouldn't bother
4/25/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: LOL?
4/25/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I never leave John alone with my laptop
4/25/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or i do
4/25/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But Then its locked
4/25/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Remember when I fucked up your GTR logo and you thought it was John
4/25/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: John was in the same room. So you left it with John
4/25/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Rip John
4/25/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: whaha
4/25/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
4/25/17, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: (q,w) yields (q',w') with respect to automaton D if and only if there is an a such that w = aw' and δ(q,a) = q. Or look at page 3 of chapter 2 for a more textual explanation.
4/25/17, 21:39 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Thank you 👍🏻
4/25/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Damn woman you smart

4/26/17, 07:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The chemistry one
4/26/17, 07:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The one with the two similar sides joined in the middle, at the south side of MetaForum
4/26/17, 07:58 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Thanks!
4/26/17, 08:00 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Wait so the one next to matrix?
4/26/17, 08:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes

4/26/17, 08:04 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: He was gone on Monday so we joint other groups
4/26/17, 08:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ahh, who is a good tutor then?
4/26/17, 08:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Not Gerard zwaan
4/26/17, 08:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I know haha
4/26/17, 08:24 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Where is the tutor hour for group 10

4/26/17, 08:37 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Does anyone know where group 14 should be for Automata? The study guide said MF13...
4/26/17, 08:37 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yes, exactly

4/26/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I could get from the sibeliuslaan to audi, get myself a cup of coffee, check my schedule 3 times and still be in time for the lecture in 23 minutes
4/26/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would you be willing to bet a cup of coffee on that :p
4/26/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: It's a shame that not everybody lives on the sibeliuslaan
4/26/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: True, but the Sibelius is almost the furthest you can live from the uni
4/26/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Not true, I'm pretty sure Roermond is further away than that
4/26/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I sense a contradiction
4/26/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 👆🏼👆🏼

4/27/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but it is still empty
4/27/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: there are no subjects in there and in the folder they gave me the names of the subjects were not given
4/27/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: That I don't know, but I would think the Osiris Helpdesk
4/27/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: For it's called Osirisplanapp
4/27/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ah thanks!
4/27/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay so at the moment I am carefully going through the reader of chapter 2 for automata, and let me give you all a nice warning
4/27/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: DO NOT LACK BEHIND
4/27/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is a shitton of work to keep up to date
4/27/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Currently we have been given the lectures for Section 2.1 and 2.2, and those two already are a lot of reading, understanding and exercising
4/27/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In theory you should have finished reading/understanding and doing 2.1 and 2.2 before your next tutor session
4/27/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Well Then i have a lot of Work to do Tomorrow
4/27/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 😂
4/27/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahah
4/27/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This shit should be doable as long as you keep track of it at all times
4/27/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Like LST
4/27/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Make sure you can get an 8 so that you get a 6 at the exam :p
4/27/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Oh wait, the theory we covered is not the same as 2.1 and 2.2 then?
4/27/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well it should be, but did you check the exercises and reader?
4/27/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It has a lot of small important stuff I think
4/27/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Although this could still be semi-easy, it will get harder quick
4/27/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Mehh
4/27/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay for people who are not super-smart it will be difficult Sander 😂😂
4/27/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just trying to make sure people do not underestimate it
4/27/17, 22:22 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Heroes nowadays do not wear capes :D

4/27/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He's a bit old fashioned
4/27/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I said meh, as ugh I dont want to😂

4/28/17, 14:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I cant seem to find it in canvas
4/28/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There is no email for HTI
4/28/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You have to email either of the teachers
4/28/17, 14:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ok so what is the email for de bro
4/28/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: P.M.E.D.Bra@tue.nl
4/28/17, 14:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanksu
4/28/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: that's the mailadress of paul de bra
4/28/17, 15:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Anyone know if printing in library is open today ?
4/28/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Nop
4/28/17, 15:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :{
4/28/17, 15:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: fack
4/28/17, 15:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oki thanks
4/28/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Is it true that the recommended exercises for automata are numbered differently than the exercises in the reader?
4/28/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Or am I slowly going crazy...
4/28/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: <Media omitted>
4/28/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Yeah i know but in the chapters they start each paragraph with numbering the exercises starting from 1
4/28/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: whereas in the recommended exercises they do not start at 1 and keep on counting if that makes sense
4/28/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: so you have like 2.2.10 which i dont think exists
4/28/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: since it only goes till 2.2.5
4/28/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 2.2.4 in the book is probably 2.2.10 of the list if you count the exercises starting from paragraph 1, but the lecturer will probably give more clarification on which exercises are recommended
4/28/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: When you ask him
4/28/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ah oke thanks
4/28/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: i will let you guys know

4/28/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There is an old site available
4/28/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/2it70/
4/28/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which contains books with the exercises
4/28/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which also contain answers for said exercises
4/28/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thanks!
4/28/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys does c^0 mean none or more or at least one but can be infinitely many
4/28/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So c^n with n>= 0
4/28/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: (for automata)
4/28/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because I think there's a mistake in question 2.2.10 a
4/28/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
4/28/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And the answer they come up with uses at least 1 c
4/28/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: In my copy of the document, it says "c^(n+1)"
4/28/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Instead of c^n
4/28/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: lmao
4/28/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: @31643222030 guess it was wrong after all
4/28/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yep
4/28/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Fucking knew it lol
4/28/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: I have the same doubt, I'm assuming that something like c^n with n=0 means exactly one c
4/28/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No it doesn
4/28/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: doesn't*
4/28/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: In other exercises the answers show that they also use c^n means as having no c's at all
4/28/17, 17:37 - Casper Smits: c^n should be interpreted as "n number of c's"
c^(n+1) hence becomes "at least 1 c". The assignment can easily be solved when you interpret it like that. It is the same as saying c^n where n > 0
4/28/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: Yeah you're​ right, made my mind a bit clearer
4/28/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That is though when the n+1 is there😂😂
4/28/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Tough*
4/28/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No I should've added a comma.. That is though, when the.... Otherwise it should've been That is tough when the n+1 is *not* there though
4/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: you guys should learn how to English
4/28/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You always refuse to teach me

4/28/17, 21:11 - Bart van Dooren: There is a guide on cs-students how to use Planapp and then you can add those subjects very easy
4/28/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Alright thanks!
4/28/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Will check it out

4/29/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Anyone who knows when we get grades back from fundamentals and/or cs resit?
4/29/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Does canvas work for anyone?
4/29/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Yes
4/29/17, 22:36 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Laggy but does

4/29/17, 22:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 15 workdays after exam
4/29/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Scks
4/30/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: What is the deadline for the DBL grades?
4/30/17, 13:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 15 work days after the exaam 😊
4/30/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: But is the deadline date the 'exam'?
4/30/17, 13:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Date last group had the presendation +15 work days =  deadline for results
4/30/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then i should have had mine already?
4/30/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz the last presentations were 7 april
4/30/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so deadline would've been 28 april
4/30/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: which is two days ago
4/30/17, 14:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Stef holidays are not workdays
4/30/17, 14:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Remove kingsdayfriday
4/30/17, 14:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And other days when tue does not work
4/30/17, 14:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I want them so bad too but sadly they squeeze every second
4/30/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: It's administration probably
4/30/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: DS is not on there either yet
4/30/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So yes, Osiris people fuck up
4/30/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Reading the USE book chapters: Worth it or USEless?
4/30/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you have to read anyway for the final exam
4/30/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: so you do it all at once in the last week or now
4/30/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright seems fair
4/30/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: im happy we have a pdf at least
4/30/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is the summary on cs-students sufficient?
4/30/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or do they say other important shit in the book
4/30/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I think the summary should be sufficient, it's rather well made and still feels like too much info
4/30/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ❤

4/30/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: like in set theory
4/30/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay, so what does it mean in this context then?
4/30/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: In English, it says L(D) is the collection of all pathsets of all states in F
4/30/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: i think
4/30/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: so the pathsets of all accepting states i guess
4/30/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ah, that would make sense
4/30/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Since F is the set of all accepting states of D, right?
4/30/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: i think
4/30/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ah, yeah, it makes sense
4/30/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Thanks!

4/30/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Make the exercises and everything becomes clearer
4/30/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: More clear*
4/30/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am working on that atm haha
4/30/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Doing the reading atm
4/30/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I almost understand the reading and still need to do the exercises
4/30/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: isn't the reading part just the same as what was explained in the lecture?
4/30/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: or is there additional info?
4/30/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: There's not additional information there but it's useful to get accustomed to the level of formality they expect us to have for this course imo
4/30/17, 17:45 - Luke Houben: Are the USE weekly quizzes available yet?
4/30/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
4/30/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This exactly, I understood most of it, buy only after carefully re-reading multiple times because it's written down so vague
4/30/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It isn't written down vague
4/30/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah it is "exact"
4/30/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But you get the point :p
4/30/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is just written down very formally, which requires getting used to
4/30/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Although a bit of formatting wouldn't hurt
4/30/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: As a human I needed to computerize myself haha
4/30/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: The proof of theorem 2.19 was particularly fun
4/30/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: what page was that again
4/30/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: It's page 18 of chapter 2
4/30/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: also: is there a summary of some kind for this, giving the main theory and format?
4/30/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, the one made by Alex
4/30/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It's on cs-students.nl
4/30/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ah, thnaks
4/30/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (Also, for the ones who don't know Alex, the creator of that summary, yet: https://www.cursor.tue.nl/nieuwsartikel/artikel/belgen-steken-vier-ton-in-tue-studentenstartup-bitsensor/)

5/1/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: do we really have to read the proofs of all these theorems in chapter 2?
5/1/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what course?
5/1/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No not really
5/1/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Automata?
5/1/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If you understand Them
5/1/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I've looked at exams already
5/1/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Its mainly drawing automata and Turing machines
5/1/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: yes i meant automata
5/1/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That would be chill
5/1/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It was like one proving exercise

5/1/17, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah
5/1/17, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But its basically to make sure you believe itstrue I guess
5/1/17, 10:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's for you to understand why is it so
5/1/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Daan has hopes for an easy exam

5/1/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Hey guys, hoe about we plan a time to do the use-tests tu/egether? Or will we crash the canvas site if we do that? :P
5/1/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: We'll probably crash canvas doing that
5/1/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Seems like a great plan
5/1/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If the questions are the same as last years
5/1/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Then I might have answers
5/1/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: When are they live?
5/1/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: She said she changed some questions, but that might be bullshit tho

5/1/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeaaah
5/1/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thats why I asked if they are the same as last years
5/1/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Woohoo
5/1/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But then it would be strange if all sfs and wbs would have 10/10 for all of them
5/1/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Could you accidentally place those on Cs students maybe
5/1/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So we have to be careful😂
5/1/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: We are just that smart
5/1/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nahh just do it haha
5/1/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: not everyone checks this groupsapp, i doubt everyone will use it
5/1/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: and otherwise everyone should just take one for the team and make one mistake, it's not like a 9 or a 10 makes that much of a difference 😛
5/1/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 😂😂

5/2/17, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: this canvas notification: "Information about USE base ICT-DS-2" says that you have to read that article before coming to the tutorial
5/2/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ahh okay
5/2/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Data Structures has been uploaded to OSIRIS
5/2/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 6.0, my data struggles are officially over
5/2/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: No way, I had a 4.4 on canvas and on osiris it says a 5.0
5/2/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: 🎉🎉🎉
5/2/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Damn
5/2/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nice
5/2/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I don't know how to say this, but I think that is your final grade, not your exam grade
5/2/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: are you sure it's not the end result
5/2/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: It says test
5/2/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: it doesn't for me
5/2/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And on my results it says 5 credits
5/2/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: <Media omitted>
5/2/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Mine says this
5/2/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: But I'll pray for you Adriano
5/2/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Lol
5/2/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: A resit isnt a big problem anyway
5/2/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Just a little more struggles
5/2/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: At results it doesn't show credits for anything
5/2/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Only grades
5/2/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It should show the grade without "weging"
5/2/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's your final course grad3
5/2/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: grade*
5/2/17, 12:00 - Luke Houben: CS-Students will be offline for some maintenance
5/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It always shows a 5 as end result when you did not make it unfortunately
5/2/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 36162959‬: Job could you add here to this group 0621680573

5/2/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Spam😮
5/2/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: sander max stop
5/2/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
5/2/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: i dont think so because the empty string has no second or second to last symbol
5/2/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the empty string doesn't get you to the final state, no
5/2/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it's pretty obvious imo tbh hahahah
5/2/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: The empty string's second element is not a 0, so no
5/2/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
5/2/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: This is code I'm using:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{DFA}
\floatfoot{An DFA}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tabular}{ l l }
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{GFA1} & \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{GFA2} \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{GFA3} & \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{GFA4}
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}

I've triend several things already (adding a begin{tabs} with \centering or a begin{center}) but nothing seems to be doing the trick ;/
5/2/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: rip
5/2/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: try begin cventer without the H
5/2/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: wait, are we supposed to make these DFA's?, no right?
5/2/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wait
5/2/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You want the table to be centered
5/2/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Right?
5/2/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: only if u want to make a sexy summary
5/2/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: ah, ok, already sexy enough by meself 🙂
5/2/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah the contents of it
5/2/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm currently trying to do it with a subfigure but that doesn't seem to be working either ;/
5/2/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Doesn't work sadly
5/2/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Maybe instead of trying to center the table, try to center the pic inside the box
5/2/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If you understand What i mean
5/2/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: combine them in one large picture, then insert that
5/2/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: If you want to center the contents inside the table, try doing \begin{tabular} {| c |}
5/2/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Perhaps the table content is alligned to the right?
5/2/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nah Thats too easy
5/2/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but it works
5/2/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I think that that is the easiest option tbh
5/2/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I want the whole table to page centered
5/2/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But for some reason it's not doing that
5/2/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I think it is something with the float of tabular and figure interfering with each other
5/2/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz73rKIN-j6iZXZCQ09TZ2ZPYlE?usp=sharing If anyone is interested: I gathered all exams (and retakes) of 2IT70 from 2013 - 2017 and put them here for you to enjoy.
5/2/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31643222030  why not make the images /2 of pagewidth and let one go all the way left and one all the way right
5/2/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That way they are centered :p
5/2/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: guyss help

5/2/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
5/2/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: does anyone understand the answers to b and c?
5/2/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Think I do
5/2/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: B is just making sure there are two a's and one b and infinitely (or zero) c's
5/2/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Where the order can be arbitrary
5/2/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not sure how to explain it otherwise
5/2/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait did you have Fundamentals?
5/2/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: but why is it such a large expression
5/2/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yes I did
5/2/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The + are OR statements I think?
5/2/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So actually three small options
5/2/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
5/2/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but what if the b is first
5/2/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or the a b a
5/2/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: max there are three ways to exactly two a's and at least one b
5/2/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But then at b I would have to do it 3 Times with for every order?
5/2/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: With An or in between?
5/2/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
5/2/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yours is right but do it for every order of two a's and one b
5/2/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Why do they have so Many loose c* though?
5/2/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: C can happen everywhere at every amount
5/2/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But thats what I have too
5/2/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Is this posted on cs-students aswell?
5/2/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But then combined with the b
5/2/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But okay
5/2/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What about answer c?
5/2/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah @31630168397 why not post it there...
5/2/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: dunno how to
5/2/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: do i get points?
5/2/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I love u
5/2/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Fuck the haters
5/2/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: ty
5/2/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm what does the 1 mean?
5/2/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: empty string
5/2/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: as in the one is the epsilon, aka nothing
5/2/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ooh right then I get it
5/2/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Amount of characters in w is at most 3
5/2/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So either nothing (1) or something (a or b), or two arbitrary a's or b's or both
5/2/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So forth
5/2/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just combined all 4 into 1 image
5/2/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Turned out to be the way to go
5/2/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Cool!
5/2/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: ahh I get it too now
5/2/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😇
5/2/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: would my answer be correct as well though?
5/2/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Moment
5/2/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ooof
5/2/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I get what you're trying
5/2/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Write it out mathematically to be sure
5/2/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm in the train right now, so cannot do that
5/2/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: wait.. mathematically? lol
5/2/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah your answer is just a mathematical multiplication between three bracket parts
5/2/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Write that out
5/2/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you get the same as their answer then it is equal and thus also correct
5/2/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I get things like a^3
5/2/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 2ab
5/2/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: etc
5/2/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 🤔
5/2/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nono write it out in the logical way
5/2/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LST
5/2/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: With AND and OR
5/2/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Plus is OR and times is AND
5/2/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Dankjewel martijn
5/2/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys could please send Martin a personal thank you message on whatsapp for the folder he just posted?

5/2/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He's kinda heartbroken no one is appreciating his hard work
5/2/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: ffs
5/2/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But he did a great job, I was just busy :p

5/2/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
5/2/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It does indeed Sander haha
5/2/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: this is not fking LST
5/2/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: they take it or leave it
5/2/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: thanks Daan haha
5/2/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This course goes on with what we learned at fundamentals and LST
5/2/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Like mentioned at the intro lecture
5/2/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: :p
5/2/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: shhhh
5/2/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Use \makebox[\linewidth]{ ... }, where ... is your tabular
5/2/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Anne doing what she does best
5/2/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: wtf 2.3.3 is not doable
5/2/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Send it 😱
5/2/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If Anne cannot do it the universe breaks
5/2/17, 18:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I'm going to have dinner, so automata will have to wait
5/2/17, 18:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait do you eat food
5/2/17, 18:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 🙊
5/2/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How will Sander survive this catastrophe now
5/2/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Maybe they fucked up with the exercise numbers again
5/2/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I think I'm just going to do these ones
5/2/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/2it70/index.html
5/2/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: i think i'm just going to do you

5/2/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Full hocus pocus there
5/2/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I don´t even know what they are asking
5/2/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: that has not been discussed yet right?
5/2/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: this is regular expressions
5/2/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It has been discussed
5/2/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: and next up we have properties of regular languages or smth
5/2/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I think they just fucked up with the exercises again
5/2/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: that's why I'm just making the ones posted on the 'official' site
5/2/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: where is that ´official´ site?
5/2/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: lol GFA's?
5/2/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yeh something with only one final state

5/2/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Isn't this just saying that it has states q0 and qe which are both accepting so anything that would go from q0 to q0 or q0 to qe gets accepted
5/2/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which is what you should prove
5/2/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What did they want us to read for ethics for tomorrow again..?

5/3/17, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Shuffle the answers around but thats it
5/3/17, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: we'll survive that haha
5/3/17, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: In calculus they could shuffle the questions but in use they can't so ...

5/3/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Even the T for Technical is a bit much to me
5/3/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: As soon as they give courses like Psychology, Modeling and USE it gets less and less technical
5/3/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Psychology certainly has important aspects
5/3/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So i have to dissagree with that one
5/3/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But Indeed use is pure crap
5/3/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: At least this one
5/3/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And modeling was just a Joke
5/3/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Wait where is the lecture?

5/3/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Yeah, summaries for USE
5/3/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Don't know if they're useful
5/3/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂

5/3/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Is the USE test different for different courses in USE?
5/3/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Can the people that are doing the online test together post their answers somewhere?
5/3/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 👆🏼
5/3/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Yeah it will be on cs-student
5/3/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Nice

5/3/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Lol Rip
5/3/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Can you see the good answers afterwards?

5/3/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for the first test, they want us to read the first 2 chapters of the engineering the future book, right?
5/3/17, 13:18 - Bas Gieling: ysa
5/3/17, 13:18 - Bas Gieling: yea
5/3/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: okay, thanks!
5/3/17, 13:57 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: There is no reason to check slides for test right?
5/3/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what test?
5/3/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The online USE one I'm assuming
5/3/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If that's the case then no
5/3/17, 14:20 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yep, that's what I meant 
Thanks!
5/3/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Guys, if you have to prove that some language L is regular, constructing a DFA/NFA accepting L is enough, right?
5/3/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: are the summaries of USE ch 1&2 + knowledge of the lecture of last monday, enough to make the test? or is it better to read the whole thing?
5/3/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Read the summaries I'd say and while making the test keep the book with you along with ctrl f
5/3/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Is there a final for use? And if yes, when?
5/3/17, 17:49 - Renate Lemmens: Yes there is, its on monday 3th of july at 09:00-12:00
5/3/17, 18:23 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Took a look at the timetable
What's the difference between *use-subjectcode*1 and *use-subjectcode*2 ?
5/3/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Your tutorial group

5/3/17, 18:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I guess you have to check it on Osiris
5/3/17, 18:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: That's what I did
5/3/17, 18:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Like for me it says sdc1
5/3/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: On canvas you can see your group
5/3/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: fuckk, the exams that are on this site are waaayy harder with a lot of proves instead of drawing automata.... why????
5/3/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: that sucks, is there a way to know how the exam is going to be? Like more proofs or more drawing?
5/3/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I guess the exams I saw where the ones from gerard zwaan
5/3/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: but the exams from erik vink are a lot different
5/3/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: and I guess we get those
5/4/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: This has probably been asked here a couple of times, but what is gonna be the deal at todays USE hours?
5/4/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Is it like the HIT one where it was a question hour so you don't have to show up
5/4/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Or what
5/4/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You have to show up

5/4/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But it is bullshit however
5/4/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Oh okay thank you
5/4/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: I was going anyway, but I'd be bummed if it was like the HIT one

5/5/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: All I know is that you have to read the sources in one way or another, and apply that knowledge according to your part of U,S,E, etc
5/5/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah something like that
5/5/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But I have to write stuff about users but its really vague
5/5/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Well, it should all be explained in the assignment in the studyguide, that's all I know about it
5/5/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: is everyone missing almost all subjects for year 2 and 3 in the new planapp as well?

5/5/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: ah thanks ^^
5/5/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: has someone managed to succesfully validate their concept?
5/5/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Does it have to be validated before 19 may, or does it just have to be submitted before then?
5/5/17, 18:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: They first need to fix planapp
5/5/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys, which PDF is the best to use with the online test(USE) ?

5/5/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: https://osirisplanapp.tue.nl/#/
5/5/17, 19:21 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: https://osirisplanapp.tue.nl/#/plan/schedule
5/5/17, 19:22 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: thanks!
5/5/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys
5/5/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i get a problem with validating in the planapp
5/5/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: each time i try to validate
5/5/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it copies some subject
5/5/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: When is the validation deadline?
5/5/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so that i have some subjects multiple times
5/5/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Yup, HTI gets copied for me
5/5/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Guys for use, they ask me to find the two most important user types
5/5/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
5/5/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
5/5/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Or like farmers, city people etc.
5/5/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I think the second one, but if you choose for example normal residents and employers then you also have two different kind of users mentioned in the table, so most of the time you'll get both anyway.
5/5/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You mean end user/professional user specification?
5/5/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah
5/5/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Do you also need to specify user-consumer/user-activist/user-tinkerer?
5/5/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I don't think you need to specifically do that. I think it comes down to just answering the questions they ask. So lets say for the first question (What was the challenge of your case in the past? What role did Users play in past choices and solutions?) you just explain about what happened in the past regarding the challenges surrounding data sharing (in my case) and what role users played in there and what kind of choices they made and what kind of impact that had on the situation and if they came of with any solutions to solve the challenge. For this question specificially you need to name the 2 most important ones. I for example used students and employers and I explained their role in the challenge and what they did to the challenge. So let's say students tried to solve the challenge by doing x and y and the employers only made the challenge for them harder, because they could take profit of the challenge (which wasn't really a challenge for them anyway). And ehh then you need to explicitly mention your articles so just give examples from the article and refer to them.
5/5/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I'm not sure if that is all correct though, because everything is pretty vague.
5/5/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: has anyone managed to submit their planapp schedule for approval? the button is grayed out for me
5/5/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thanks that clear
5/5/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Shit, what's the deadline
5/5/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: 17th pretty sure daan
5/5/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Haven't done it yet either
5/5/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 19th right
5/5/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Yeah, same thing

5/5/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How would we state our sources? just after writing a few sentences using a source put the link after it in the middle of the tekst? put the link of all sources at the end of the tekst? use something like APA or just mark the sentences is some way and correspond that to a link?
5/5/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: why arent they more clear ffs
5/5/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: There's an appendix or something on how to use sources
5/5/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: where?

5/5/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: They did mention that, yeah. I never read through it and I just said "as mentioned in x written by y where they metion this and that and so our claim holds".
5/5/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: how many level 3 subjects did we need again?

5/6/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It has already be graded. However, I have no idea when will it be released.
5/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: she's a chinese woman who corrects our english like a grammar nazi and then says "it has already be graded"
5/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but apart from that
5/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its graded
5/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: just not online
5/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: probz administration issues again
5/6/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Yeah, but according to the law they HAVE to communicate our grades one way or another within 15 workdays. Sending an email also counts
5/6/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yep
5/6/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So DS did a great job

5/6/17, 11:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys from what i know from people in higher years this 15 day rule is more of a decoration . It happened before and there was nothing they can do
5/6/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Uni closed, doesn't count I guess
5/6/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: shit, Physics has until tuesday...
5/6/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: who is/are SfS's study counselors; are they Roel Bloo/Yves Houben?

5/6/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: automata has a weekly set of exercises (and no test), and HTI only has the projects
5/6/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Automata doesn't, I don't know about HTI
5/6/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: so just USE has a weekly deadline
5/6/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: *no weekly test for automata, we do have a interim test
5/6/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: IIRC

5/6/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is your test handed in automatically after 30 minutes or do you have to click the submit button before time is over?
5/6/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes
5/6/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Nice answer Rick
5/6/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Automatically handed in
5/6/17, 16:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It can automatically shit down but I think you can submit earlier if you want
Also one thing about the timer
It's either you use your own or you go to the last page of the test (submission) time left is written there
Which I find retarded as fuck
5/6/17, 16:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Shut*
5/6/17, 16:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Ahahah
5/6/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That's indeed pretty stupid
5/6/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: lol true
5/6/17, 16:02 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: They really should study HTI
5/6/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Especially since the timed quizzes in OnCourse already had a timer
5/6/17, 16:03 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yea, when I was doing it this Wednesday I was confused cause I wanted to know how much time is left but then I quickly realized that there is no timer
5/6/17, 16:03 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Only when I did all the exercises and got to the submission page I saw how much time is left (00:05 lol)
5/6/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: perfect timing
5/6/17, 16:05 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: By the way of you get a question where you have to match things with other things be aware that 'none' is also an option
5/6/17, 16:05 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I lost 0.33 because of this
5/6/17, 16:06 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: If you get*
5/6/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: okay this is the very first time that I notice I can simply open Overleaf in two seperate Windows to have two large screens for both typing and viewing
5/7/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hey guys, question regarding USE ICT case
5/7/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3116559?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

Is anyone able to read the required pages for the first article they supply us?
5/7/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I see a preview of page 147 when clicking the link and cannot see more
5/7/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I need an account for the second one as well.. what the..
5/7/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or do they want us to use the VPN for this
5/7/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Is this DS or SM?
5/7/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: SM
5/7/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: <Media omitted>
5/7/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Tried that?
5/7/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lol.. Will try
5/7/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It's stupid Daan, I know.
5/7/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sounds more like "If we fail to provide correct links, you can find it on Focus"

5/7/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It's funny how this doesn't help at all
5/7/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Maybe you need to be on the TU/e network or something?
5/7/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Am on VPN
5/7/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Actually your search does work (tried it as well) but then when you click it you get the whole document without any page numbers, so you have no idea where to navigate
5/7/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/7/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is a fucking mess but I managed to find article one

5/7/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Here, since the course is useless you may use my effort
5/7/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ty
5/7/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Had the same problem with some sites requiring login and such. I believe you have to be on tue network to open the links, as one of my group members was able to open all links when we were at the practical session
5/7/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well as far as I know the VPN should act exactly the same as the network itself
5/7/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: https://puu.sh/vIpPN/1cc8c8e62a.png
5/7/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: anyone any idea?

5/7/17, 14:14 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: c
5/7/17, 14:14 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: just saw the message sorry, hope its still might help
5/7/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Yes, thanks!

5/7/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: It's taking quite a long time for my grade to appear, someone else had this too ? It's been more then half an hour
5/7/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Because I heard people talk about 5 minutes and stuff
5/7/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: try logging out amd then logging back im again
5/7/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Did that, didn't work :/
5/7/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I guess I'll just have patience ;)
5/7/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's probably due to many people doing it today (since tonight is the deadline)

5/7/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: don't
5/7/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'd say user consumer?
5/7/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I don't want enzoknol to be remembered as part of dutch history
5/7/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: enzo knol is a kut vlogger
5/7/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: 0 reeten
5/7/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well you can say what you want and I hate his videos, but the dude has got his carreer figured out better than most of us
5/7/17, 15:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So why is he user consumer ?
5/7/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because he uses products dimi
5/7/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He doesn't change them or create them or invent them
5/7/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: don't worry about it it won't be on the exam
5/7/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Thats the spirit
5/7/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He's also not a projected user since they didn't create the product for this purpose
5/7/17, 15:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanks very much :}
5/7/17, 15:35 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Youtube is not for uploading videos?
5/7/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it is, good point
5/7/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But doesn't he also consume
5/7/17, 15:36 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I just think this question is retarded af 😀

5/7/17, 15:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: is it  engineers or enterprises or what ?
5/7/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I had engineers
5/7/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: engineers i think
5/7/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
5/7/17, 15:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: it makes sence but the questions ask super vague
5/7/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I understand this Joost
5/7/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think I do at least
5/7/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: GFA with states q0 and qe, for which I assume qe is the final state (not sure what a GFA is haha)
5/7/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: me neither
5/7/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And you must show that the language accepted by G consists of infinitely many movements from q0 to q0 (meaning the state doesn't change)
5/7/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and then only one movement from q0 to qe
5/7/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: because at qe it is finished I think
5/7/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think if you look up the GFA (what it is) you can explain it with what I said just now right?
5/7/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ugh, there aren't even slides online for this...
5/7/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I know the feel. But do you understand what I tried to say?
5/7/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I understand that yes
5/7/17, 15:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: HOOOOLY SHUT THT TIME !
5/7/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but I was mostly confused by the GFA part :/
5/7/17, 15:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I submitted 1 minute before final
5/7/17, 15:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: its nice how we don't have a timer on the side 😀
5/7/17, 15:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: literaly I was chilling on last questions and then I realized holy chist I have 1 min

5/7/17, 15:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I wonder what happens if you work on it and don't submit on time
5/7/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Don't get bothered by the details, the lecturers won't either
5/7/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 0 points probably
5/7/17, 15:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: does it auto submit or does it fuck you rough without coco butter
5/7/17, 15:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thats scary maaan

5/7/17, 15:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: was it just me or were the questions veeeery vague and loosly asked

I have bad example 
Last year studied in Arnhem 
We found out our grades two days before retake
5/8/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They don't even send an auto-mail with (apologies blabla)
5/8/17, 11:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: So in comparison it's still okey
5/8/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I get that they are late though, all their systems have changed and they need to convert all the data
5/8/17, 11:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Bruh you job is to put in stuff in folders and use the fucking calculator and occasionaly send emails and put stuff in system.. you cant be fucking tired ok ?
5/8/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But if after the summer holiday they still havent fixed their shit I will get mad
5/8/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How do they need to convert numbers in an excel-like file to email it Adriano
5/8/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just send it and take your time to convert afterwards
5/8/17, 11:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: They are just some old ass motherfuckes with no motivation
5/8/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: The one grade that's uploaded by me 
Is wrong😂👍🏻
5/8/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: That isnt administrations fault
5/8/17, 11:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Do you know how big the studet administration is for sfs
5/8/17, 11:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 10 ppl
5/8/17, 11:54 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Write them a letter then
5/8/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No I blame physics
5/8/17, 11:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: There you go

5/8/17, 11:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: We are not the ones who are responsible for that
5/8/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Doing that after the deadline tonight 😂
5/8/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh whoops I didn't see this was the nospam chat
5/8/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: My bad
5/8/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: They have more stuff to do first and they probably get a hundred mails a day. And it isnt the course fault as well. They already sent it to admin prob. But admin hasnt sent it because they have other shit to do
5/8/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Take the awesome DS example of the email, but of course we're only the ones paying and them the ones receiving payment
5/8/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: When is computer systems result day? The exam was on tuesday.
5/8/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Was it the day after DS?

5/8/17, 12:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think so
5/8/17, 12:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: This is insane if you think about it almost halfway in the next quartile you still dont have your results 😬
5/8/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Yeah takes long
5/8/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Maannnn they have like 3 exams to check for computer graphics and they're STILL not done with that
5/8/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: And they are all nearly perfect right
5/8/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you bet they are
5/8/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Do we already know when the USE exam is?

5/8/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: For USE, does anyone know if you can use sources outside the ones provided on Canvas?

5/8/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Thats what our tutor said

5/9/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Had quite some fights with the links as well
5/9/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ehh guys, why is there no mention of Hypermedia in any of my Osiris pages?
5/9/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: no web science?
5/9/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Even the Q4 courses are in the "voortgang" tab but Hypermedia is no where to be found and so there are 5 points missing in the total thingie as well haha
5/9/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I have web science yes
5/9/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: oooh
5/9/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: well i don't know then
5/9/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: according to the total "voortgang" thing I have all courses, including the current ones, but Hypermedia does not exist ..
5/9/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Let's send a mail about that
5/9/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/9/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/9/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: yeah and use basis (0SAB0) is called 0SAB0C but it complains that i do not have 0SAB0 in my package
5/9/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: daan a mail has been send about the package
5/9/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: no answer yet
5/9/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: There is a tue site that says more informatio will be up in the beginning of May, but they take their time...
5/9/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Jej
5/9/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I sent them a critical mail just now, also clearly mentioning the deadline is closing on us
5/9/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: More complaint mails means higher priority in my experience
5/9/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: How do they expect us to meet their deadline if they do not have the planapp working correctly before the deadline
5/9/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah no worries, they can't
5/9/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's just ironic
5/9/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And just watch to see their reaction "oh yeah we've been so busy (with things you see no result of) and you gotta be patient because we all have such stressing lives" after they created the deadline themselves.. Hehehe
5/9/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: <Media omitted>
5/9/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: 4th quartile is at least 2/3 BEP

5/9/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Has anyone started writing their "Joint problem statement" for USE yet?
5/9/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It seems really vague since I don't consider "social media" a problem. Mainly there are lots of small problems that arise and get solved
5/9/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Guys I want to choose the artificial intelligence package
5/9/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But I can't find it
5/9/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is called "interactive intelligent systems"
5/9/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Okay thanks

5/9/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Might be that highest grade counts
5/9/17, 17:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What is nab3?
5/9/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The intermediate
5/9/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: highest grade counts yea
5/9/17, 17:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So the first field is my grade ?
5/9/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Final grade, yes
5/9/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: You'll have to do it again next year
5/9/17, 17:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Top kek😓
5/9/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: I swear to god these physic people hate me. I needed a 6.2, got a 6.1. For the first take, i had a 5.4, where a 5.5 would make it way more easy.
5/9/17, 17:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Welcome to next years physics luuk 💀
5/9/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: This is fucking bullshit
5/9/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: may I btw ask for people who passed Modeling with good grades, what was your study plan for it? Could you maybe PM it to me?
5/9/17, 17:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Or type it here
5/9/17, 17:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🦆
5/9/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh if others need it as well then please type it here haha
5/9/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Make sure you get 90%+ on the math part
learn some basic modeling questions
5/9/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: I got 34/40 points on the modeling final
5/9/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Out of the multple choice
5/9/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's nice!
5/9/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: What i did is practise the math on oncourse, and read through the modeling reader and make some notes on it
5/9/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I got 33 questions correct, I pretty much downloaded all the summaries I could find, read them, then do the practise exams, then go back to the summaries and note the things you really want to remember, then study those a bit more
5/9/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 👆🏻 and math
5/9/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I made sure I got 90% of the math questions right, read through the summaries about twice and got 32 I think.
5/9/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For the math questions my main issue was that I always took the second derivatives, but never knew for sure for which exercise I should do exactly what with the values hah
5/9/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: But my resit strategy would be: Kill the math questions, since they are pretty much always the same, so make sure you get 18/20 of it. Furthermore, try to gather your final points on the modelling theory questions.
5/9/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But that sounds more like a lack of practice
5/9/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yeah thanks guys! I'll mainly focus on the math's then, had only about 10 or 12 of those
5/9/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: in the theory questions, crossing wromg things out is sometimes also easier than thinking of whats correct
5/9/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: How can you find your physics tutor from Q3? I don't know here to find it
5/9/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I read all the summaries and lecture slides. Practicing as many exams as possible and probably the online tests for modeling questions help too.
5/9/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks guys!
5/9/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think my main issue was a lack of practice, so that should work out
5/9/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: what is projected enterprise?
5/9/17, 17:49 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: For theory watch the lectures. Although there is shits load of unnecessary info there are still pretty useful
5/9/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The Enterprise (business) for which something was meant / made / created
5/9/17, 17:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: At least material is explained well with comparison to the notes they provided
5/9/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: thx
5/9/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not necessarily the Enterprise that is going to use it in the end
5/9/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is a good one, I discarded them as being irrelevant
5/9/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 12026240‬: ?
5/9/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In Oncourse?
5/9/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: (not sure)
5/9/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They gave a file in the first week, that should still be on there
5/9/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 12026240‬: Nope can't find it there, study guide says it was on oase. 😅
5/9/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: It was on oase, but we can't access that anymore
5/9/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: We need it to sign up for the resit
5/9/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 12026240‬: Ill just say in my resit mail that we can't find it anymore since its on oase
5/9/17, 18:16 - Luke Houben: You can access oase btw
5/9/17, 18:17 - Luke Houben: Oase archives are available through canvas > help > oase archives
5/9/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: thanks!
5/9/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Can someone help with the planapp thing? Because I can put in subjects but I dont know what goes where
5/9/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I can put in 4 subjects in 1 quartile etc. And leave some at 2
5/9/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But I don't really understand
5/9/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I should do that before the 26 of may right?
5/9/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: 19th
5/9/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: What subjects or packages ?
5/9/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I was on the wrong planapp appearantly
5/9/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: decent
5/9/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The fact that that is even possible is messy as fuck
5/9/17, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I love the name change. 
We already have planapp.tue.nl
But we need a New one for osiris
Lets go with 
Osirisplanapp.tue.nl
5/9/17, 18:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: isnt it lovely
5/9/17, 18:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
5/9/17, 18:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I found it by guessing
5/9/17, 19:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/9/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why the file://localhost/"url"
5/9/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Of course you also cannot click it, so that aside
5/9/17, 19:22 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: It might be when you are at uni I think
5/9/17, 19:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Still localhost is your own laptop
5/9/17, 19:24 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Ah you're right, thought that localhost could be at anywhere in your Wifi network for a momdnt
5/9/17, 19:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahah
5/9/17, 19:46 - Casper Smits: In the new planapp, is it correct that when I choose "Software Science" as major, I cannot choose "Software Science" as exam program? Only the combination of Software Science, Web Science and/or Mathematics?
5/9/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: It is in there somewhere.
5/9/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's what your mom said
5/9/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31648187618  dont
5/9/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: understood 🤓
5/9/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: lol
5/9/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: rip
5/9/17, 20:09 - Casper Smits: It isn't. I have checked everything, changed starting year etc. I only see combination programs
5/9/17, 20:11 - Kevin Jilissen: <Media omitted>
5/9/17, 20:13 - Casper Smits: I am just going to mail Bloo or someone
5/9/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So, when reading the USE articales for your case. What should you do with them or afterwards?
5/9/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I mean I understand the article and such, but what exactly is the link between the case, the article and the paper
5/9/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I suggest throwing them away
5/9/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well for me I use the articles as reference for the pieces I have to write
5/9/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm doing society so I'm marking down everything that has to do with society
5/9/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And I'll refer to those parts when I feel it will clarify things and make my arguments stronger
5/9/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So while you're reading the articles you jot down little sentences as scratch paper
5/9/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ahh like that
5/9/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nah I just mark them in the pdf
5/9/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah understood
5/9/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks! that already makes it more clear than it was
5/9/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: ;D
5/9/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: what arguments are you even supposed to make?
5/9/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: USE is shit
5/9/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: part 1-10
5/9/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: part 1-10?
5/9/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You just need to come up with your own 'challenges' for you case and then argue about those challenges involving your 'aspect' (user, society, etc..) and use your articles to support your arguments.
5/9/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ahh okay, okay
5/9/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I Just simply dont understand it
5/9/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sander, I don't fully either, but what Nick just said is useful
5/9/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: So I have the case data sharing and my challenges resolve around privacy violation
5/9/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: and then I just look at how users used to deal with this in the past and back that up with my articles
5/9/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I still regret reading 2 whole articles
5/9/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Does anyone still have the email where thy explain the grade change for physics 😶 I can't find it
5/9/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: from what date was it
5/9/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
5/9/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks Tijs
5/9/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait I'm just about to start reading my second article. You don't recommend actually doing that?
5/9/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: It is useful to read the articles
5/9/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: As it helps with making the assignment
5/9/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: It helps if you devide the articles in.your group and make USE summary of then
5/9/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: So you have access to what information.is said about your piece that you have to.write about in each article
5/9/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay I tried to open that link for way too long
5/9/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks Joost ;p
5/9/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It's useful, sure..
5/9/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I just regret doing it though
5/9/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Sorry, phone has a keyboard with the . Close to the spacebar
5/9/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: So I accidentally press it sometimes, sorry
5/9/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: haha no worries, was more joking that I am too tired to continue right now
5/9/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: <Media omitted>
5/9/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: no
5/9/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: you can shuffle
5/9/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: but make sure you take the needed courses
5/9/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Because software specification which is a mandatory course for sfs as far as I can tell. Is not in my plan app in my base package
5/9/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: They should be in my base package right?
5/9/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: 2ix20
5/9/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: just add it and make sure to take all mandatory courses
5/9/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Okay thanks
5/9/17, 22:49 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: What do you do with a quartile that has 4 subjects?
5/9/17, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: if no other option is posseble accept it
5/9/17, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: when did we need to do what again?
5/9/17, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Ace all subjects
5/9/17, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no for real
5/9/17, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: there was a deadline for something
5/9/17, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Do you have to plan in a failed course again?
5/9/17, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: May 19th for plans for the coming years
5/9/17, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And when is the course definitely considered failed?
5/9/17, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what do we have to do with those plane anne
5/9/17, 22:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Plan in all electives for the next years
5/9/17, 22:52 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Put ot in the planapp, validate it, hope the planapp works by that date and submit
5/9/17, 22:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: ?
5/9/17, 22:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: ?
5/9/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Probably when you failed the last resit that will be given this academic year
5/9/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: We have more resits?
5/9/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I thought you had one per course
5/9/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: one
5/9/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If you fail the course you have to do it again, sometimes that is also possible in the same academic year AFAIK
5/9/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I don't know, some people said lst had more, but I didn't have lst
5/9/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But do you have to put it in planapp again then?
5/9/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You should mail roel about that I guess
5/9/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: This shit is vague af
5/9/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The planapp doesn't seem to allow duplicates, except when it made some itself for no reason
5/9/17, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Don't you get automatically enrolled into courses you failed for the next year?
5/9/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I guess
5/9/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Because you cant know if you failed it right now
5/9/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: For some courses
5/9/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: How do you submit?
5/9/17, 23:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And validating is only a tool for yourself right?
5/9/17, 23:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I mean if validation goes wrong for a not relevant reason it's okay
5/9/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: No
5/9/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You have to validate
5/9/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Draft → Overwrite plan, but it might give an error
5/9/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Then they get put in your studies
5/9/17, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ah I'll try that
5/9/17, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But how to do it with the unknown security project of the security package
5/9/17, 23:39 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Wait until it is added probably, I don't know who is responsible for that, but I sent a mail to a study counselor who told me to contact mytue, so now I'm waiting for their response
5/9/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ah okay
5/9/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
5/9/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I just added it manually
5/9/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But I guess it'll cause problems submitting it
5/9/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But it would be great if you let me know what their respond is!
5/9/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Will happen
5/10/17, 08:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For all the other peeps for whom Hypermedia does not appear in Osiris:
5/10/17, 08:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/10/17, 08:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which doesn't make sense at all, since our new courses also do not have processed results yet they DO show up
5/10/17, 08:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I'll take this typegoat's word for it
5/10/17, 08:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: http://www.win.tue.nl/~wsinswan/automata.processes/

5/10/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: damn man
5/10/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay while I was making a little collection of those the website went down for me
5/10/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is it still up for you guys?
5/10/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Youtube still works, so not my internet problem
5/10/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what website?
5/10/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The one Rick just sent

5/10/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: still works for me
5/10/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hmm weird
5/10/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Could it kick me for downloading too many files at once
5/10/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: its the tue so it cant be that smart
5/10/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Right..
5/10/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Weird haha
5/10/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Other browser did the trick
5/10/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Tue troubleshooting: if it doesn't work, use internet explorer
5/10/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: LOL
5/10/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: imma try that
5/10/17, 09:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: still nothing lol
5/10/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Do not use this one
5/10/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: This is the site of Gerard zwaan
5/10/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hé teaches it in quartile 2
5/10/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: His exams are way different and easier
5/10/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well that fuckign sucks
5/10/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That link was on canvas for a long time already though
5/10/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You'd imagine the courses being of same difficulty and with that the exams as well
5/10/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/2it70/index.html
5/10/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: This one is from vink
5/10/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait how is it possible that the same course has different difficulties depending on the quartile
5/10/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Compare the exams for yourself
5/10/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Don't they make the exams with all teacher together, same as how they correct them
5/10/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Well, if they are given by two different lecturers who don't coordinate with each other, they won't be the same difficulty
5/10/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: From what I understood they check all exams with an army of teachers
5/10/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Doesn't the same army converse about the exam
5/10/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: The problem is probably Gerard zwaan
5/10/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No doubt
5/10/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: But yeah
5/10/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If you dont mind not getting your propedeuse this year and want An easy quartile, dont fail automata and plan ik next year quartile 2
5/10/17, 10:23 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Different teacher - different exam 
Although the subject is the same
5/10/17, 10:24 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Faced that last year
5/10/17, 10:24 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: We were accidentally given the exam of teacher that was teaching the subject in parallel with ours
5/10/17, 10:24 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Just for different groups in different timeslots
5/10/17, 10:25 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: And the material was completely different
5/10/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jesus... The mess keeps amazing me
5/10/17, 10:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: (I was in different university that however)
5/10/17, 10:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: But I see similarities in administration and communication tho
5/10/17, 10:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Similarity in chaos
5/10/17, 10:28 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: We are at uni and we pay a few thousand per year, what do you expect? Capable teachers? 😂
5/10/17, 10:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah don't be ridiculous Luuk
5/10/17, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's not like they're getting paid or anything
5/10/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: The Germans (Data structures ) are good and efficient but they are Germans what do you expect ? And Arthur is very good also
5/10/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Bad lutik is also okay
5/10/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: But we don't talk about JFG
5/10/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Spam?
5/10/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Bad Lutik 😂
5/10/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Bas*
5/10/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: we are only discrediting teachers as if there all bad and I think some are good and that can be said. 

I don't think that's spam but if other disagree with me please let me know I'll shut up then
5/10/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Ye shat ap
5/10/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Guys I'd like to ask a serious question is that's okay
5/10/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I have no idea how to start the Governance analysis of my USE report. Has anyone got any tips to help me on my way? I'm kinda stuck already..
5/10/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And FYI @31683038783  & @31623837581  are also admins of this group. 

They are doing a wonderful job with cs-students. I thrust them not to do anything weird and to help me monitor spam. (Since I can't be always available)
5/10/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Won't let you down 👍🏻

5/10/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I assumed that governance was about the ppl who decide for everyone
5/10/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Like technocrats
5/10/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Yeah well the thing is
5/10/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I have no idea what governance is
5/10/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and next to that
5/10/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: even if i knew
5/10/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i have no idea what to do

5/10/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: welp
5/10/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alrighty then

5/10/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: @31631192870 governance is de wijze van besturen @31621372984
5/10/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Enzo
5/10/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: de wijze van besturen van wat?
5/10/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: gwn government?
5/10/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Onder andere ja
5/10/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: En wat 't beste voor 't volk zou zijn
5/10/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: De users
5/10/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Dat werd ook bepaald met die governance
5/10/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Waarborgen van samenhang en transparantie in het bestuur en toezicht van een organisatie, met het oog op een efficiënte en effectieve realisatie van beleidsdoelstellingen
5/10/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck me
5/10/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Yes
5/10/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
5/10/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: all of them are
5/10/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if you google the package name
5/10/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you will see that theres prob 3 or 2 of them from which you have to choose one
5/10/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: No I believe the legal thing isn't in it anymore
5/10/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And has been replaced by an offensive security course
5/10/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Or something like that
5/10/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Pretty vague, sorry 😂
5/10/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: There is probably someone who can explain it better
5/10/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so.. just a hacking course
5/10/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah I believe so
5/10/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: offesive security
5/10/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
5/10/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Make sure when you Google the package, that you check the date of the document
5/10/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Because there is a document that was meant for previous years available, but this package has changed
5/10/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So it is not accurate anymore
5/10/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
5/10/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yes that, perfect :)
5/10/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: thank you
5/10/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Credits to @31623837581 I believe
5/10/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Yup, got that in an email
5/10/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Does anyone know in which quartile/timeslot that course is given in
5/10/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: So we don't need all courses?
5/10/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you look at the skill level and make sure you have a 1, a 2 and a 3 i assumed
5/10/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Would you recommend the security package or the preperation for security master package
5/10/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And it also says in the security package picknick 15 points.  But does the mandatory sfs course already count towards that?
5/10/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: well if you take the security package you can also do both the level 3 courses so you have 3 extra subjects
5/10/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: since one of the courses in the package is already in the sfs major
5/10/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But you need to pick 3 subjects
5/10/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: From the package
5/10/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but why?
5/10/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Does the sfs subject already count towards that?
5/10/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: It says so in the package description
5/10/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I can take any course I want as long as it meets the difficulty requirements and it adds up to 60 CP right
5/10/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: oh
5/10/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You can pick more of course
5/10/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But my question is do we have the sfs subject plus 2 others. Or plus 3 othes
5/10/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Others*
5/10/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: three others
5/10/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Okay thanks
5/10/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: (or two if you can argue that you need the third subject for something else )
5/10/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Three others, including USE afaik
5/10/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: but the default is 3 per package
5/10/17, 12:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Can some kind person explain to me what we are supposed to do in this new plan app before 19
5/10/17, 12:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Nd how
5/10/17, 12:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I am in it and i have no idea what to do 😬
5/10/17, 12:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐸
5/10/17, 12:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🙏🏿
5/10/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yes three per package
5/10/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: why are almost all courses given in quartile 1 thats so retarded
5/10/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/questions/15990818/how-to-use-the-new-planapp
5/10/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: to start with
5/10/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i dont hjave any fking room in Q1
5/10/17, 12:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thanks
5/10/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But does the course for sfs count towards the three?
5/10/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: no
5/10/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Weird
5/10/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: and then take 2 coherent packages and three electives and use
5/10/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: and make everything fit
5/10/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: we have in our study the package system design  and cant chose it
5/10/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: should I plan my study program in 3 years or am i free to take as many years as i want? 😅
5/10/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: but the coherent packages are the easy way, by default they are seen as a ✅ study program,  

however you can totaly shuffle the subjects and have 0 coherent packages *iff* you can argue why this is indeed a compleet study and the exam comity agrees
5/10/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: your free to pay as long as 10 years
5/10/17, 12:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: only 10 😀
5/10/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: but after 10 year without compleeting a study your stufy is gone
5/10/17, 12:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: woah
5/10/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: for sponsorship by the government
5/10/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Would you recommend algebra for security or Legal and technical aspects
5/10/17, 12:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanks for link of cs
5/10/17, 12:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: if I have other questions I will ask later thanks guys :>
5/10/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Nvm can't pick lega
5/10/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Legal
5/10/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Only first year wtf
5/10/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: if you dont have linear algebra first youll die in 2WF70 Algorithmic algebra and number th.

so you have to chose algebra for security
5/10/17, 12:51 - Bart van Dooren: I thought that legal course would be replaced by a new course which you can plan in second year or third
5/10/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Well its not there
5/10/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Correct. The new course isn't in planapp, though.
5/10/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Wtf
5/10/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: How am I supposed to do the course then
5/10/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: roel bloo said if the planapp isn't working we'll get additional time
5/10/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: in the opening of Q4
5/10/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: so spam everyone with emails that their shit is missing or not working
5/10/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: I sent one to sfs study counsellor and they said they cant change things in the planapp so he fowarded my mail to the department head or something
5/10/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: A study counselor of mathematics told me to contact mytue, mytue said they didn't have an answer, so they sent the questions about the planapp to the 'Back Office'
5/10/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: In other words, nothing is going to change
5/10/17, 13:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ok guys so I followed the instructions in cs students about the planapp
5/10/17, 13:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: now I have all the mandatory subject puls my first year electives
5/10/17, 13:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what do we do now 😐
5/10/17, 13:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: do I have to choose 1 coherent package or what ?
5/10/17, 13:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and if that's the case are there any packages I am not allowed to take
5/10/17, 13:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and what are the most popular ones
5/10/17, 13:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and also I have a resit for next youar how can I put it again in year 2 .... when I try to put it gets removed from the first year plan
5/10/17, 13:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so many questions :{ sorryyy
5/10/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You need two coherent packages and one USE package
5/10/17, 13:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: eeek 😀
5/10/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: You can add your own course in the planner
5/10/17, 13:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what do you mean by that ?
5/10/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: If you click on one of the plusses on your schedule, you can add your own course
5/10/17, 13:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: aaah ok
5/10/17, 13:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanks :3

5/10/17, 13:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: physics...
5/10/17, 13:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i cant seem to add it
5/10/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Ah dang
5/10/17, 13:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: its grayed out
5/10/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Hmm
5/10/17, 13:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
5/10/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Try it manually in your schedule, not the catalog
5/10/17, 13:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: eeeeh how ?
5/10/17, 13:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i click on plus and then i seach in catalogue
5/10/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: no
5/10/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: click on the plus, type in whatever you want to call it and click add
5/10/17, 13:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what do you mean whatever i want to call it
5/10/17, 13:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can i call it JOHN CENA ???
5/10/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: just call it Physics
5/10/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: <Media omitted>
5/10/17, 13:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: aaah thanks 😀
5/10/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: And yeah, john cena is valid
5/10/17, 13:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
5/10/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Can't you just drag it from Y1Q2 to Y2Q2?
5/10/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: is it really stupid to have a 4th year with a lot of empty spaces?
5/10/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Why a 4th year?
5/10/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
5/10/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: because all the courses i want to take are in Q1 and Q2
5/10/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: It's either this or do some stupid ass subjects I don't wanna do anyway
5/10/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Well, you can always learn more stuff in year 3 and 4
5/10/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: But it wont matter
5/10/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: As long as you have enough ects
5/10/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: And iirc you can get your bachelor at the end of the first semester and immediatly continue with a master if you want
5/10/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: @31640998750 if you move the 2 use ones you have in Y4 to Y3 and DZC20 to Y4Q2, you only have half a year extra, saves you half a year
5/10/17, 13:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok guys i cant add physics 2 times wtf ?
5/10/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Why would you want to add it two times?
5/10/17, 13:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I have it normal in year 1 but i need to add in in year two for the resit right ?
5/10/17, 13:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I cant seem to do that
5/10/17, 13:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: It not showing up as an addable subject
5/10/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: what can i do with this half a year?
5/10/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: make money
5/10/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: wank it
5/10/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: But you got the window as described above right?
5/10/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: stuff like that
5/10/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Not pay uni money, maybe start master if that's possible, work Idk.
5/10/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or do a stage
5/10/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: at some technical company
5/10/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: master is only possible with a finished bachelor
5/10/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: and i cant move DZC20
5/10/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: since i need it for DZC30
5/10/17, 13:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what do you mean ? like tobin
5/10/17, 13:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yep

5/10/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Hmm strange
5/10/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: this is not my picutre btyw
5/10/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Yeah ik but it should work nonetheless

5/10/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: is it correct that i now have to fill 11 elective slots?
5/10/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: no
5/10/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 10
5/10/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i think
5/10/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 7 in years 2 and 3
5/10/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: and you got 2 in this year
5/10/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so that makes 9
5/10/17, 13:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: you should be having 12 subject per year
5/10/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: and a use package which makes 12 slots
5/10/17, 13:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 4 q per 3 subjects
5/10/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: okay let me state that differently
5/10/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: do i now have all my major subjects?

5/10/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: 2IX20 Should be y2q2
5/10/17, 13:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and i don't rememmbe the y3q4 subject maybe its an elective you chose :}
5/10/17, 13:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oh wait you put it from q1 to q4
5/10/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Y3q4 is end project + 1elective
5/10/17, 13:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: sorry
5/10/17, 13:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: then why is the cs guide showing us to put it in y3 q1 ?
5/10/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Is also possiblr
5/10/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ah oops
5/10/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You can do it in either y3q1 or q4
5/10/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: But q4 is recommended
5/10/17, 13:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: eeeh 😐 it sounds very ambitios to be q1 :I
5/10/17, 13:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yep
5/10/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Yup haha

5/10/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: just wanna be 100%  sure lel
5/10/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: But if you can't fit it in your planning to do it Y3q4 you can do it in y4q1
5/10/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Yeah looks fine to me
5/10/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nice thnaks
5/10/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If you have to many subjects for y2q2, shifting dbl algorithms to y2q4 could be a nice solution btw
5/10/17, 13:51 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Wtf why cant i find anyof the mandatory courses on catalogue???
5/10/17, 13:52 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: they are on the side of your plan
5/10/17, 13:52 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: they are already in your sideview
5/10/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: When creating a draft, first program = Software Science 2016 - PB, second program = Software Science 2016 - B
5/10/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Then they are on the side indeed
5/10/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Like shown here: https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/questions/15990818/how-to-use-the-new-planapp

5/10/17, 13:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: they are auto put in plan later if you do every prior step when drafting correct
5/10/17, 13:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: btw i have no idea what half of those coherent packages or use shit are
5/10/17, 13:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: which ones are even connected with sfs
5/10/17, 13:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: half of them are architecture and biology 😀
5/10/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: does anyone get "Student is not registered for this study programme." when clicking "Overwrite plan"?

5/10/17, 13:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: wny do they want us to choose everything now ?
5/10/17, 13:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and what happens if you don't give a plan or atleast not a full plan until 19 ?
5/10/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Just make sure you have your plan the 19th
5/10/17, 13:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but can i change it later like wt fthey want me to decide my next 3 years worth of subjects now ?!
5/10/17, 13:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: also when i make the plan what do i do besides saving it ?
5/10/17, 13:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: do i validate or some shit ?

5/11/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Like is it just a huge file with all your key presses in plain text?
5/11/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Same ==> C:\Users\Public\MicTray.log
5/11/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Appereantly it only works for backups?
5/11/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: It says in the article it gets cleared when you log out
5/11/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: So it would only store your keys for that session, unless you back it up everytime

5/11/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: is the package App development also possible for software science people?

5/11/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: Does your choice for electives change the possible software science masters you can choose at the end?
5/11/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I dont think so
5/11/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it may alter the level of succes though
5/11/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yeah some packages are recommended if you want tot do specific masters, but nothing is mandatory

TL;DR: https://cs-students.nl/x/CgAFAQ
5/12/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Why only on hipchat? I dont want to download another app only to ask for help/help other people...
5/12/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: This app wil still exists
5/12/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Cuz its a dictartorship and you dont have a saying luuk
5/12/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: just deal with it
5/12/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hihi
5/12/17, 11:37 - Luke Houben: It also has a web interface so you don't have to download anything
5/12/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: But more subject related question about subjects not everyone has can be  asked on hipchat
5/12/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: That makes it even worse imo
5/12/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You never use whatsapp web?
5/12/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: how does that make it worse LOL
5/12/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: I did, until I found out that whatsapp has a program which can be installed on your pc. Furthermore, whatsapp also offers an app which always notifies me when I get a new message
5/12/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: thusfar you have not mentioned a single feature not present in hipchat
5/12/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, in our tests the web interface worked without any hickups
5/12/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'd recommend you'd do further investigation of the new platform before attempting to criticise it
5/12/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol i knew this was going to happen
5/12/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: It needs a new app
5/12/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: trust me luuk, I've tested it and it works wonderful
5/12/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Whatsapp needs another app as well, why not use the built-in SMS capacities of your phone?
5/12/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: So why does whatsapp not work wonderful?
5/12/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Because sms is paid
5/12/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yeh
5/12/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: hipchat is free
5/12/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: And also whatsapp, so why not just use that, since everyone already has that😂
5/12/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Because the 100 different groups are annoying af
5/12/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because it has some severe limitations, most of them are linked to moderation and other organizational stuff
5/12/17, 11:43 - Luke Houben: Because hipchat offers full integration with the main page of cs-students to share questions etc
5/12/17, 11:43 - Kevin Jilissen: That's where the problem started, people didn't like it
5/12/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also this very much
5/12/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: because we're making a system that better accommodates our needs, expecting people to take a tiny step out of their comfort zone such that we can benefit as a whole
5/12/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: cause we know this group isn't filled with autists that completely spass out when something changes
5/12/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I mean thats like 6 reasons
5/12/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: should be enough
5/12/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: people asked for it, so it was made
5/12/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dont you it if you dont want it
5/12/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you dont have to
5/12/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Guys if some people dont even use whatsapp how do u expect them to use hipchat thingy
5/12/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we're just saying its available and very useful
5/12/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because hipchat is an entirely different system
5/12/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 😀😀😀😀😀 amazing
5/12/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: pff guys shut up about this stuff already
5/12/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: we don't, cause when you don't use whatsapp you won't get the invite link 😛
5/12/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It does not require you to share your phone number, have a smartphone and have an app installed
5/12/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: if some people dont like it, let them be
5/12/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and dont hate before you tried it
5/12/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: So why not keep the groups on whatsapp around
5/12/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 👆🏻
5/12/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: JUST STOP THE FUCKING SPAM JEEZ
5/12/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: also true
5/12/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: No its a great idea, but for instance cs elective group is pretty much useless because no one really talks and answers when someone asks sth
5/12/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Its the same deal when we try to use hipchayt
5/12/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'd recommend moving the discussion to the other chat as it is more apropriate
5/12/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and so people can see this
5/12/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Guys, please stop complaining. A lot of work went into development of this platform, and it's fine if you dont want to use it. Just stick to whatsapp if you dont like it, but stop hammering it.
5/12/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 13825397‬: Oké, it's fine if you want to make another app for it if you think that's better. But why do you say "the official SFS/WBS chat will stay on WhatsApp. Course related chats will only be available trough Hipchat" 
Why is is up to you to decide that?
5/12/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: I don't hammer it, just don't delete the course specific groups.
5/12/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: guys, plese move this discussion to the other chats
5/12/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: It's not even possible to delete groupschats on whatsapp
5/12/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah lets moe
5/12/17, 11:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yea, I want to thanks people who are working on it because they are improving the system with no payment just for an idea 👐🏻
5/12/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: move
5/12/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: we will be happy to answer questions there
5/12/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 13825397‬: If People want to use WhatsApp groups, you can't force them not to
5/12/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: keep this chat clean
5/12/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: We're not are we tho julia?
5/12/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we are no dictators who can force you to leave a group
5/12/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 13825397‬: Sound like they want to
5/12/17, 11:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Lets move the spam to hipchat guys🦆
5/12/17, 11:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😇💁🏻

5/12/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 13825397‬: And i don't even care about these chats
5/12/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: @31613825397 please move this discussion to other chat so people can discus other things here
5/12/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 13825397‬: No, i want them to change their advertisement
5/12/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Guys, I didn't show up for my Logic resit because I already passed the course, but somehow a 4.0 has been uploaded to OSIRIS. How the fuck does that work?
5/12/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I will have to kick you for a certain amount of time if you don't stop
5/12/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: JULIA PLEASE FUCKING STOP COMPLAINING JESUS CHRIST
5/12/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Dbl
5/12/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: anyway, got a 10 for dbl apparently. results are on osiris (finally)
5/12/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Godsamme man zoveel autisme op deze vrijdag ochtend
5/12/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Doe gewoon rustig
5/12/17, 11:56 - Luke Houben: Hey everyone

We noticed that people didn't quite like all the different group chats for each course. We decided to create software that could combine them all.

We proudly present to you: CS-Students Hipchat. This messaging application will bring all chats for each course together in one single, multi-functional application that works on all platforms! It also offers quality video calling and a lot of fun with custom emoticons. The possibilities are endless!

Get started by reading our guide, located at https://cs-students.nl/x/CgAFAQ. It will tell you everything you need to know about how to get started and use its powerful system.

The official SFS/WBS chat and Official Spam chat will stay on Whatsapp.

Have a nice day and we will see you online soon on Hipchat!

5/12/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: People worked fucking hard for this platform, you're not now gonna fucking dont let them off for the way they make it available
5/12/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So this doesn't disappear in spam
5/12/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Woop woop, we too!
5/12/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: <Media omitted>
5/12/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I've got a 9, also pretty good
5/12/17, 12:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I passed with a *INSERT GRADE HERE* also pretty good
5/12/17, 12:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Comp systems resit is also out
5/12/17, 12:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: *insert pass here*

5/12/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Got an 8
5/12/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I think it's great people are putting a lot of their free time in solutions like this and cs-students, but there is no guarantee that people will use it. Cs-students worked out, but if people prefer WhatsApp because they are more used in using WhatsApp then you can't do much against that
5/12/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: In the end it all depends on where people can get answers the fastest, and while cs-students was great as it allowed more extensive questions and answers, trying to replace the speed of WhatsApp will be hard
5/12/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Guys what does NVD mean?
5/12/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: without knowing the context 'Niet VolDaan?' = not completed
5/12/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Wtf, my fundamentals grade is NVD but I most certainly showed up
5/12/17, 12:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Nichtvordumkopfen
5/12/17, 12:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐔

5/12/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: But weird that they only do that with fundamentals..
5/12/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Yeah, odd
5/12/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Maybe because it's resit
5/12/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: No clue
5/12/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: It might be because it's an elective course
5/12/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: So you're not supposed to do it again
5/12/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Yeah could be
5/12/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Ok thank you guys!

5/12/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Make an error
5/12/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Then you should be able to click it
5/12/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Recompile
5/12/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And Then remove the error
5/12/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: See If that does anything
5/12/17, 12:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oke

5/12/17, 12:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But... it worked fine until now
5/12/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hmm
5/12/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Dunno

5/12/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Guys if we could move the hipchat discussion to the spam group
5/12/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ur a bit late
5/12/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: It died off
5/12/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I had to be somewhere and Better late then never
5/12/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Lmao
5/12/17, 13:02 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: am Itheonly one who can access to http://fws.e-office.com/?
5/12/17, 13:02 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It just doesn't open
5/12/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: its too edgy thats why
5/12/17, 13:03 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Oh, wait
5/12/17, 13:03 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: now it works
5/12/17, 13:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🙄
5/12/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Embedded systems is online
5/12/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Don't know if someone said that already
5/12/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: yes but it was lost in the discussion above
5/12/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Add that to the infinite list of errors!
5/12/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Does it matter if you have the dbl app development
5/12/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Before the app programming course
5/12/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Because I can't figure out a way to put it before
5/12/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And I can't make an app of I dont know how
5/12/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I dont think its a good idea
5/12/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: most dbl's are a level 3 course
5/12/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: to apply the knowledge you have aqquired in the introductory and deepening courses
5/12/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yeah Imagine doing embedded systems without computer systems
5/12/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: <Media omitted>
5/12/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yeah thats why I asked
5/12/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: There is no too many credits btw
5/12/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I know
5/12/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Honors students even get 30 extra per year I believe for whatever reason
5/12/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I also noticed dbl algorithms is before algorithms
5/12/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: How is that logica?
5/12/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Logical*
5/12/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: 15 p/y 30 total
5/12/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Noice
5/12/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Look at the levels ;)
5/12/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Dbl is 2 and subject is 3
5/12/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: What does DBL actually stand for
5/12/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Design based learning
5/12/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Oh nice
5/12/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yeah that sounds like fun
5/12/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But only if you already have some skills though
5/12/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I asked one one who also did this and his answer is: "Het is te doen, natuurlijk is het te doen. Bovendien, als je algoritms kan, dan is de rest van informatica makkelijk"
5/12/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Translation: it's doable and if you can do the subject algo the rest of your study is easier

Lossy translated
5/12/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: is the automata interim on the same location as the normal tutorial?
5/12/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Yes
5/12/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Algorithms as 4th course in the first quartile of the second year it is
5/12/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You mean dbl?
5/12/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: The subject algo is level 3 and harder than dbl algo which is level 2

Normally you do level 2 -> level 3 
So dbl algo before subject algo 

However it is possible (and doable with effort) to do the subject algo (level 3) before the dbl algo (level 2)
5/12/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Is this clear?
5/12/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But why would you?
5/12/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I have the package security and therefore the subject crypto (forgot the hole name) and this a  level 3 subject and in the same q als the subject algo. Since both are hard and it's better to move one of them to y 2 and the other to y3 

I can't move crypto to y2 because then I don't do the package in order and that's not allowed in this package. So I have to move algo (level 3 ) to y2 to survive my study
5/12/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You cant do app programming
5/12/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You're not allowed to do 2IS60
5/12/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
5/12/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
5/12/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Damnit
5/12/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: So we can't do the package app development?
5/12/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: you can do the other subjects of the package but it may not count as a coherent package
5/12/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: <Media omitted>
5/12/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: <Media omitted>
5/12/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Anyone ?
5/12/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Know the answer ?
5/12/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sending a decent screencap would be a good start, but I'll try ;p
5/12/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I'd say c
5/12/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm
5/12/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: a or c
5/12/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: although c sounds a bit simple
5/12/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: a is more the "thinking route"
5/12/17, 18:00 - Reinier Schmiermann: I'd say a, I do nog think that the SGP uses technocratic  means
5/12/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: Id say a as well, mostly because I think the other options are incorrect
5/12/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: SGP = political party and therefore doesn't really use any technocratic means, no.
5/12/17, 18:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I even questions their democratic means
5/13/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/13/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I know whitespaces shouldn't be in filenames, but this needs to be usable for people that do not know that
5/13/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Maybe split the file name at spaces and then trim and recombine them
5/13/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 49673083‬: Or try using urlencode
5/13/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Could you elaborate? This should work automatically for all images that get uploaded 🙂
5/13/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Cannot do it manually for all
5/13/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 49673083‬: You can do urlencode($text) and that should automatically make it work
5/13/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 49673083‬: Instead of just using $text
5/13/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wait really 😛
5/13/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks man!
5/13/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Gonna look into that haha
5/13/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31648187618 next time could you put it in the other chat?
5/13/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh sure
5/13/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wasn't sure to which extend things are considered spam 😂
5/13/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Not study related :p
5/13/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Or impacts the study directly
5/13/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: In my opinion but I others think different let me know
5/13/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: DS final examination and homework grades are officially on osiris now, even though we knew them already
5/13/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Took em long enough
5/13/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Is there somewhere on Osiris where we can see that we got the etc for a course like on oase?
5/13/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I believe it's under studie voortgang and then one of the tabs there

5/13/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: i think they mean that it you have the word w and you separate them in letters a1 a2 .. a_n and w' 
then the lenth of the word |w|  is the amound of letters you removed 👎 and the remaining word w'
5/13/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: the 👎 is n and () around it
5/13/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: does that help?
5/13/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yes
5/13/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i got it
5/13/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: thank youu
5/13/17, 13:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, what's the name of our automata lecturer?
5/13/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Erik Vink
5/13/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I believe
5/13/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Erik de Vink
5/13/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It is
5/13/17, 13:31 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thanks man !
5/13/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Cs-students.nl
5/13/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I kinda have the feeling cs-students.nl is becoming the next 42
5/13/17, 13:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thanks, next time I will firstly go to the website before asking a question here!
5/13/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just need to write a book about it
5/13/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: @31643470096
5/13/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ahw Hell Nah
5/13/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Which major specific courses does Software Science have Y2Q3?
5/13/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Because I cant find the Software Specification course anywhere on planapp
5/13/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And the one that is listed under Major courses is only for Y1, dont get this lol
5/13/17, 14:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Eeeh there is a tread about it in cs-students
5/13/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Lol okay 😂
5/13/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks
5/13/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31642623926 , is the new deadline for the study plan known yet?
5/13/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope
5/13/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is postponed indefinitely
5/13/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is always positive ;p
5/13/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can someone explain to me what governance exactly is for USE?
5/13/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: It's about how policies and regulations  should be adjusted by governmental bodies when faced with challenges in technology
5/13/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so when analysing it for the report/poster thingy, and they ask for a challenge from the past, I can just name one of the policies or regulations and talk about it?
5/13/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: as long as you can reference it in sources yes
5/13/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thanks!
5/13/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: What exactly is expected from us in the Reflection part?
5/13/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: check how reliable your sources are
5/13/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Just follow the study guide
5/13/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: maybe they were written from the perspective of the motor company, and they are only saying how great the car is(this is biased, and therefore not a great source)
5/13/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: studyguide says: did the sources make you biased when writing the conclusion
5/13/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if I go by that, this would be my reclection
5/13/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Reflection
no
5/13/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: But why not, some more explanation would be necessary
5/13/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: And then you got a reflection
5/13/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice
5/13/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is the deadline to enter your electives in the planapp before 19-5 still in place?
5/13/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Scroll up 10 messages
5/13/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: postponed indefinately? wtf!
5/13/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yisssss
5/13/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: No I don't have to do shit
5/13/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Just as planned
5/13/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: but shouldn't we get an email about that or smth?
5/13/17, 16:35 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: the thing is that we still haven't received any message abut this
5/13/17, 16:35 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: +
5/13/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
5/13/17, 17:59 - Reinier Schmiermann: No, it is C
5/13/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'd say C imo
5/13/17, 17:59 - Reinier Schmiermann: The empty string is in the language of C
5/13/17, 17:59 - Reinier Schmiermann: And r+0 is the same as r
5/13/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ahhh okay
5/13/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Thank you
5/13/17, 21:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm

5/13/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ohh so then it would be B
5/13/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lol, thanks John ;)
5/13/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: np famalam

5/13/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ff kijken
5/13/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ik denk b
5/13/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: maar not sure
5/13/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hmm
5/13/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Die weet ik ook niet eigenlijk
5/13/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: nee ik ook niet en ik wil je geen foute antwoorde ngeven hihi
5/13/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahah
5/13/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Iemand die meer weet?
5/13/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ik denk b
5/13/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ik denk ook b, geen garantie though
5/13/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL dat is 3/3 die b denken en een meningloze ik
5/13/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Dus b it is, zonder garanties ;p
5/13/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: thanks guys!
5/13/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Are they gonna show the grade after 5-15 minutes again?
5/13/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: nee
5/13/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: no
5/13/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You're kidding right.. Why not 🙁
5/13/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: maybe because they discovered that we dont do these tests individually
5/13/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: and that we copy answers from ppl who have near 10s
5/13/17, 22:20 - Bas Gieling: because they wanna disappoint us all at once ;D
5/13/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lol, how smart
5/13/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They're evolving
5/13/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: they are still retarded tho
5/13/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I have the course business inf systems 2iic0 as part of my major by default however in the process analytics and systems flyer it says that it is for BTW students 
Is sth wrong ?
5/13/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
5/13/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: anyone has their grades for USE test 2 already?
5/13/17, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I made my test yesterday, but still no grade yet
5/13/17, 22:38 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: They will be up after deadline
5/13/17, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: while the first test, I got my grade in 5 min or so
5/13/17, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ah
5/13/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Also, anyone has a summary containing *only* the info for the upcoming midterm?
5/13/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You should be able to easily ace it
5/13/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Still, having a summary would be nice to use to help study imo
5/13/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Isn't there one on cs-students?
5/14/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Midterm for Automata you mean? Not USE right
5/14/17, 00:09 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: There is no interim for use anyway 🙄
5/14/17, 00:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Yeah, automata, forgot to mention that
5/14/17, 00:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exactly 😋
5/14/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I can send u one tomorrow
5/14/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Today technically, just after sleepy times
5/14/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I made one
5/14/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I can send
5/14/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Later
5/14/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: We should maybe all collaborate on 1 really good summary
5/14/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I like to think mine is quite alright
5/14/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I've put a link to my overleaf project in cs-students
5/14/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm making one myself anyways
5/14/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: It's a bit messy but we can cut it down
5/14/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Summarizing is a better way to learn than just reading the summary
5/14/17, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: True
5/14/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Where's the link?
5/14/17, 00:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: On cs students
5/14/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: nvm found it
5/14/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: This is my summary btw
5/14/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 00:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Currently up to 4.1 has been summarized
5/14/17, 01:09 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: @31640998750 @31640634783 wanneer beginnen we
5/14/17, 01:42 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: ?
5/14/17, 01:42 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Waarmee
5/14/17, 02:06 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Dat vak
5/14/17, 02:11 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Oh hahaha
5/14/17, 02:11 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Ik denk.maandag
5/14/17, 02:11 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Miss morgen
5/14/17, 02:26 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It probably means that only BTW students can choose this subject as part of the package, for SfS students it doesn't count because it is part of the major
5/14/17, 02:52 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ok thank you
5/14/17, 03:28 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: But if you want to follow it
5/14/17, 03:28 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: You probably still can
5/14/17, 03:28 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: As an extra elective not being part of your major program
5/14/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Do you guys know the dates for the q4 exams ?
5/14/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: The 2 weeks with last examday 7th of july
5/14/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Yh but not daily right
5/14/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Specific dates i meant
5/14/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 30686090‬: You can check them on canvas, go to help, then oase archive and there is a list with the dates of all exams
5/14/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Aight
5/14/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So if I recall correctly the midterm exams from Gerard Zwaan's page are of no use to us, and we can only practice the single exam Vink gave us?
5/14/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yep
5/14/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well that sucks haha
5/14/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But the exercises are a lot like the homework I think
5/14/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ah that's a small relief at least
5/14/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: At least, I'm assuming that the real interim exam will be similar, so some DFA/NFA 'simulations', and some pumping lemma stuff
5/14/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: similair to the practice one you mean
5/14/17, 12:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: More particularly, you are supposed to be able to

*give a DFA that accepts a given language and establish the path sets of its states
*convert an NFA in a language-equivalent DFA
*establish an equivalent regular expression from a DFA
*formulate and apply the Pumping Lemma for regular languages.
5/14/17, 12:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: (from canvas)
5/14/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh nice, only the fourth one I do not know haha
5/14/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks Andrei!
5/14/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: holy shit the examplary intermediate exam is really easy by the way
5/14/17, 13:15 - Bas Gieling: it is
5/14/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: is it
5/14/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: it is btw the same exemplary intermediate exam as last year
5/14/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: i think it will be pretty much the same as the exemplary test
5/14/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: tip: learn how to formulate the pumping lemma
5/14/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will do! After I do all the exercises haha
5/14/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: the recommended ones, that is ;p
5/14/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: is it important to know what lemmas/theorems state what exactly or is it sufficient to say for example: by a theorem from the notes, there exists a regular expression for this DFA?
5/14/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think you should be able to do the exercises and the practice midterm
5/14/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because that is what you need to do on the actual midterm
5/14/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I hope we don't need to know all of them by heart haha
5/14/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I just now read your question
5/14/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: yeah but for some exercises you need theorems, in the tutorials they used that aswell
5/14/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You can always cheat a little by saying "we know that ...." Instead of "by lemma 2.4, ...."
5/14/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: yeah true
5/14/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: luckily i have the test on Wednesday 😏
5/14/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah same here haha
5/14/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Although USE needs a shitton of work done before then as well sadly
5/14/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: keep in mind that the poster only amounts for 5% of the grade, the other 95% is the actual essay
5/14/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah that's true ;)
5/14/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And then the exam is also at least half of the final grade
5/14/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So this poster is nothing
5/14/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: yeah, but still, in total, lots of work for use
5/14/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Btw I got a dumb Automata question
5/14/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When establishing with path sets that some weird L(D) = L, you just need to write down for each state with which combinations you can arrive at that state right?
5/14/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: like question 1 on the example interim?
5/14/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Like this one:
5/14/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: yeah i think so
5/14/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: to show that the path sets for the final state(s) are the same as the language
5/14/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: like this
5/14/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: a * a^* i would say for q_1
5/14/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yeah me as well haha
5/14/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just changed it
5/14/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks though

5/14/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then I'm gonna continue. Thanks for clarifying!
5/14/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: me too, thanks for your help aswell
5/14/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait did I do something
5/14/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: well you answered my question in the beginning so yeah
5/14/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: :)
5/14/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahah true that, no problem ;p
5/14/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: q1 should be a a* tho
5/14/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: there needs to be one a to go to q1
5/14/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes thank you for clarifying what Nol and me said as well ;p

5/14/17, 14:13 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: What does it say?
5/14/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You need to register again before every acacemic year (between June 1st and August 31st) to be allowed to use all facilities and attend education.
5/14/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Re-enroll for the studies on studielink every year
5/14/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: https://educationguide.tue.nl/organization/student-administration/re-enrollment-senior-students/enrollment-in-the-same-program-2017-2018/ this is the TU/e version
5/14/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks!

5/14/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then this should be okay? 🙂
5/14/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yeah
5/14/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: awesome
5/14/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You can basically remove a2 though
5/14/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: And just cycle 1s in the a0
5/14/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh I understand, thanks!
5/14/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Np
5/14/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: for the interim exam
5/14/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: GFA's are not something we need to know right?
5/14/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well they were on the one of 2016
5/14/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And it's part of 2.4
5/14/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 2.3*
5/14/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So I think we do
5/14/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright

5/14/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: *a series of states for every word in the finite language
5/14/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Since they don't ask a proof, any correct addition to the answer Yes or No should be acceptable
5/14/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh thanks, so Yes would do the trick haha
5/14/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: awesome
5/14/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: sound like a Rick-answer
5/14/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: he's gonna ace this
5/14/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: When is the intermediate
5/14/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: For this
5/14/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Interim
5/14/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Test

5/14/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice
5/14/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: hakan when do you have automata instruction
5/14/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: actually
5/14/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Oh

5/14/17, 15:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: like what time
5/14/17, 15:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I cant find it on canvas
5/14/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I hope not the first hour, considering NS likes raping us at those times
5/14/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But we can ask tomorrow Dimi
5/14/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: during your tutorial
5/14/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah the tutorial is both hours though, the test only lasts 1
5/14/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: I think it's like logic
After we made the test he shows us how to do it
5/14/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then we'll prey the NS-demons leave us be
5/14/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: pray*
5/14/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: there are answers for every question
5/14/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: automata
5/14/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They send a canvas message with time, the test starts at the beginning of the tutor hour, so 13:45 Monday and 8:45 Wednesday
5/14/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Great!
5/14/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: rip wednesday people
5/14/17, 15:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: never forgetti 8.45   moms spaghetti :<
5/14/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: oh i was wodnering how long we would get
5/14/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Vink said last lecture it would probably only last 1 hour
5/14/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Although he didn't confirm yet
5/14/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: He did, in the same announcement om canvas
5/14/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Anne is always at least one step ahead of me ;p
5/14/17, 15:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: lets shit them ....daaanne
5/14/17, 15:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oops ship
5/14/17, 15:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: *
5/14/17, 15:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🦆
5/14/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Damn.. I would like to know that as well
5/14/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 16:16 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: its NFA you don't need traps for it
5/14/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But it shouldn't accept wrong sequences right
5/14/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or do I just not need to draw the trap
5/14/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because then I get it 🙂
5/14/17, 16:17 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: yes
5/14/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ah great, thank you
5/14/17, 16:18 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I would advice to watch some videos about NFAs
5/14/17, 16:18 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: it will be more clear
5/14/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will do!
5/14/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: No i think you need a tau transition or something
5/14/17, 16:20 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: it does work but using silent steps you will have less transitions
5/14/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: or that
5/14/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31630168397 , you mean silent between every state to the next? Instead of the b and c I use now
5/14/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And remove the bottom c
5/14/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: this was taken from the summary from overleaf btw
5/14/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah think it should be flipped
5/14/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: use \vdash in LateX
5/14/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 12026240‬: @31648187618 Yes that's what he means i think
5/14/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 12026240‬: Its also in the answers at the bottom of the file btw
5/14/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Jep /vdash is the way to go ;D
5/14/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I've learned a fuckton of special latex characters since I started making a summary for automata
5/14/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is not, only 2.2.2
5/14/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: well, I'm not really familiar with it, but I saw it when looking through the summary, and decided to mention it so that the author can improve it
5/14/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The idea of shared overleaf is everyone can edit right 😂
5/14/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, that's true
5/14/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html
5/14/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Rick gave me this, it's really useful
5/14/17, 16:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 16:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: b?
5/14/17, 16:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I wrote b
5/14/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: c
5/14/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: defo
5/14/17, 16:35 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: c is what people lived there did
5/14/17, 16:35 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: here is a talk abut econmists
5/14/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i was joking
5/14/17, 16:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 16:35 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: oh i get it now:D
5/14/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: yes b that last one

5/14/17, 16:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I am veerry confused here
5/14/17, 16:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I chose d
5/14/17, 16:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: cause they made a model in the picture
5/14/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Same
5/14/17, 16:57 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: its a small dam
5/14/17, 16:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: looks like a broken pipe to me but heh
5/14/17, 17:00 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: guys for automata examplary test - is the answer given for 1b the only right one? because when I use conversion method i don't have state 0,2,3 but have state 0 instead of it with the same transitions
5/14/17, 17:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: and also state 1
5/14/17, 17:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 17:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: its d right ?
5/14/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: If you use the method described in the lecture, you get the result from the answers, so everything else will probably be marked wrong
5/14/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yes, d
5/14/17, 17:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ❤
5/14/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: 😘
5/14/17, 17:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 17:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: niggggggggrrr
5/14/17, 17:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: is it technocracy?
5/14/17, 17:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I don't get it its from 1992 that means its def participation
5/14/17, 17:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but the question bothers me
5/14/17, 17:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: this kind of inovations...
5/14/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I'd say participation, because then Pepsi would have consulted some regular people before releasing the product
5/14/17, 17:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I also chose particip
5/14/17, 17:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: its a tricky one
5/14/17, 17:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but if its participation .. hmm
5/14/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: By the way, my timetable doesn't show a USE lecture tomorrow, is that right?
5/14/17, 17:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: MOST UNLIKELY I AM RETARDEEED
5/14/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: It might be participation but this reasoning is wrong, Pepsi released it during age of participation but they ask when it was most unlikely
5/14/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Lol
5/14/17, 17:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: tomorrow no use so we can work on posters
5/14/17, 17:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :3
5/14/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Oh really? Some extra time to learn for automata is always nice
5/14/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Lovely
5/14/17, 17:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: soo again 5 min and my grade should be up right ?
5/14/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: No lecture?

5/14/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Nope they disabled that
5/14/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: They don't show you your grade anymore unfortunately
5/14/17, 17:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :|
5/14/17, 17:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: wait so when can I see my grade ?!
5/14/17, 17:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :||||||||||||||||
5/14/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: That's a very good question
5/14/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Monday I would guess
5/14/17, 17:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: after finals ?
5/14/17, 17:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :D
5/14/17, 17:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: well thanksu very muchu gracias guys :>
5/14/17, 17:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :3
5/14/17, 17:48 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I think there is a mistake in exemplary test answer for automata 
In 1b answer holds if from state 1 "a" leads to {0,2,3} 
But it doesn't - it leads to {0,1,2,3}
5/14/17, 17:51 - Bas Gieling: can you take a pic of the nfa?
5/14/17, 17:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 17:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 17:53 - Bas Gieling: yea youre right
5/14/17, 17:53 - Bas Gieling: but why are they considering state 1 on its own anyway?
5/14/17, 17:54 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Idk
Like I was trying to get a solution from the answers for really long time
But then I mentioned that if you assume that 1 ->a goes to (0,2,3) then you get the one from the answers
5/14/17, 17:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Hugo, how did you get the answer?
5/14/17, 17:55 - Bas Gieling: i got the same answer as the answersheet as well
5/14/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: me too
5/14/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: you can go from any of the states of {0,2,3} as start state
5/14/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: since you have the T transitions
5/14/17, 17:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: With 1->a going to (0,2,3) or (0,1,2,3)?
5/14/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: you can go to all of them
5/14/17, 17:57 - Bas Gieling: you first consider state 0, which is actually states {0,2,3}, as they can be reached by silent steps from state 0, check what sets of states it can reach by processing a or b, and then continue considering the sets of states you just found and repeating the procedure
5/14/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: just look at the T transitions
5/14/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 1 -> 0 with a
5/14/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 1 -> 2 with an a and then a T
5/14/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 1 -> 3 with a T, T, a
5/14/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: sorry, a, T, T
5/14/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: then for going from 1-> 1 you use T, T, a
5/14/17, 17:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yea but then there is no state 0,2,3
5/14/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: because you can go from 1 to 2 with either a T or a b
5/14/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: that's the initial state
5/14/17, 17:59 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Okey do you have a paper with your tables of Nfa and Dfa?
5/14/17, 17:59 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Cause I don't get it
5/14/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: the state {0,2,3} is the initial state because of the T transitions
5/14/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: hope it's readable
5/14/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: oh, and the () should be {}
5/14/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
5/14/17, 18:02 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Okey now I get so you start making a table from states that are reachable from initial state with the initial step itself, right?
5/14/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ah, that makes it easier to remember, thanks
5/14/17, 18:03 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Reachable from initial step with silent steps*
5/14/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: the initial state here can be multiple states because of the silent steps(T), making the first state {0,2,3}
5/14/17, 18:04 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Okey now I get it
5/14/17, 18:04 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thanks man!
5/14/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but if there was no T transition from the initial state, then the initial state to work with would be {0}
5/14/17, 18:04 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: My problem was that I was trying to conver Nfa table to Dfa
5/14/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: just practice some of the excercises from the book, that  is always useful to understand it better
5/14/17, 18:05 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thanks man! I was just confused because every method from the YouTube leads to a different answer
5/14/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: no problem :D
5/14/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Is it just me or did they fill in the wrong numbers for Hypermedia?
5/14/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Grades you mean?
5/14/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: They entered the grades into the wrong columns / with the wrong weight. But your actual final grade is correct (at least it is for me)
5/14/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: ah alright
5/14/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: are there summaries of the use articles on cs-students?
5/14/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I know it's the lazy option but I had a lot of shit going on at home this week.
5/14/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Have not found any so far ;)
5/14/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Although those articles are not that important really
5/14/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They're just some sources with which you could start writing your essay part
5/14/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: well it's hard to write a believable essay without any literature quotes 😛
5/14/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: true, but for that you don't need to actually read them
5/14/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just scan for important parts
5/14/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: a summary won't get you the quote part either ;p
5/14/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: depends on the summary 😛
5/14/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: a good one should have them
5/14/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂

5/14/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: So a
5/14/17, 20:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: guys where can I find the year calendar
5/14/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Before I start learning from the internet how to derive a DFA from an NFA, is that allowed? Or do they have some weird course-specifiek method
5/14/17, 20:16 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: on www.mytue.tue.nl
5/14/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They have a method that is derived from the proof of theorem 2.19. If you use some other algorithm, it should be similar, or you should give the proof for that algorithm on the test...
5/14/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: whoops haha
5/14/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Where can I locate the clear explanation of that method 😎
5/14/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Studying the examples 2.20 and 2.21 should help to figure out the process
5/14/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will do, thanks!
5/14/17, 21:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Modeling grades are out

5/14/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Grade for written test is your final mark
5/14/17, 21:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ye thats what i thought

5/14/17, 21:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Same for every course so far except dbl
5/14/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: another groupchat?

5/14/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: There is a modeling chat as well
5/14/17, 21:45 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: or maybe 4 so we can split based on skill level
5/14/17, 21:45 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: make that 8
5/14/17, 21:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: ~or we can use hipchat~

5/14/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: wait what
5/14/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: FALSE
5/14/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: pretty sure written test are just the open questions
5/14/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: im pretty sure its not
5/14/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Written test is open question and MC
5/14/17, 21:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its final confimed its named the same way in study guide
5/14/17, 21:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Final written test
5/14/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
5/14/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah it is just your final test grade
5/14/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not your course grade
5/14/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: So written test = your grade
5/14/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They didn't say that anywhere
5/14/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: final test grade

5/14/17, 23:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Always worth a shot

5/15/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: A2 for som

5/15/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: And then u pick an y that is a^l
5/15/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: and you will find that it also accepts a^m+1 b a^m
5/15/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: whats the difference between ∅ and {ε}?
5/15/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: empty set vs set containing empty string
5/15/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so one is nothing and one is something that contains nothing

5/15/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No (I'd think)
5/15/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: no nvm
5/15/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But it can go to an accepted state with tau-transitions
5/15/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i was wrong
5/15/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yeah

5/15/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: At the bottom
5/15/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Not all of them are correct tho...
5/15/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: so when it does not make sense could well be that it is just a wrong answer
5/15/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Okay
5/15/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Thanks
5/15/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What did a GFA add to a DFA/NFA again
5/15/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: End state and arrows with a 1 written next to it from the end states of the DFA/NFA to the new end state
5/15/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: If you were wondering the test is very easy
5/15/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: At least the one we've got
5/15/17, 14:18 - Casper Smits: It was exactly like the example test that was given on Canvas
5/15/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: It's just two exercises taken straight up from the reader
5/15/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/15/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will see whether I get that ;p
5/15/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think you have to use (b+c)* instead of b* everywhere
5/15/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Then it's correct
5/15/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wait good point
5/15/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I forgot the c completely haha
5/15/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks!
5/15/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Yap that's the mistake found it tho
5/15/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Intermediate test is literally the same questions as on canvas, only a different NFA and instead question 4 was pumping lemma for a^n^2
5/15/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nicee
5/15/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: question 4?
5/15/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There only were two questions right
5/15/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Question b of assignment 2
5/15/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: The 4th/last question
5/15/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ahh like that
5/15/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: werent they supposed to have said that N should be a natural number
5/15/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: for 2b
5/15/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's only wrong if we do it
5/15/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If they do it "it should be obvious"
5/15/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: nah fuck those clowns
5/15/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Stijn be getting everyone 10 point
5/15/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Go for it mate
5/15/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: i didnt answer that one because if n isnt natural the language is regular
5/15/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Was it allowed to take the exampaper with you from the test?
5/15/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: lul
5/15/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Make serious work out of this
5/15/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: the way the question is formulated now
5/15/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: assuming that n is natural is wrong so
5/15/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: ill fuck some ants
5/15/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No maybe you're even correct man
5/15/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: we'll see
5/15/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We denote the empty set by a 0 or a 1? Which was which again in Regular Expressions
5/15/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 1
5/15/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: thanks, what did the 0 do again
5/15/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 0 empty set, 1 empty string
5/15/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks master Anne 😋
5/15/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: do you guys know anything about midterm hti=
5/15/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Shit when is that again
5/15/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah its Tomorrow
5/15/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 23
5/15/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: There is a hti midterm?
5/15/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oooh wait yeah
5/15/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ye
5/15/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah like Hypermedia
5/15/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: All colaborate on laptop and do test on Canvas
5/15/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That kind of test
5/15/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Live in classroom but you can use the internet
5/15/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: From home or in lecture hall?
5/15/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: web whatsapp?
5/15/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ah alright
5/15/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Up to what chapter do you need to know?
5/15/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Chapter Google and Whatsapp web Nol
5/15/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: top kek
5/15/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Ayy
5/15/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: When was it again?
5/15/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: 23 may
5/15/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Ty
5/15/17, 16:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: <Media omitted>
5/15/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol wrong page mate
5/15/17, 16:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: They've always been on this page
5/15/17, 16:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Oh wait
5/15/17, 16:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: My bad
5/15/17, 16:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Nevermind haha
5/15/17, 16:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thanks
5/15/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: which example midterm exam should i solve for automata?
5/15/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The one on canvas
5/15/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The one on canvas
5/15/17, 16:42 - Luke Houben: The one vink gave us indeed
5/15/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oki
5/15/17, 16:42 - Luke Houben: It's alsi in the automata section on cs-students together with the answers
5/15/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: But the test is very similar to the one on canvas
5/15/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: So you should be fine if you unserstand the one from.canvas
5/15/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: okay thankyou
5/15/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: what do u mean cs students and canvas has the same exam
5/15/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: The real test is similar to the practice one
5/15/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oh okay
5/15/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait so wednesday we probably won't get the pumping lemma..
5/15/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The way he talks about it
5/15/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: What is he saying?
5/15/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "the people who got the exam today got a question about the pumping lemma, which was te following:"
5/15/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Don't think we get it as well then haha
5/15/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Hmm I mean
5/15/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That could be the case, but don't they want the two tests to be somewhat the same?
5/15/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: It would be very unfair if he explains it now for the people who have the exam Wednesday
5/15/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He doesn't explain the pumping lemma now though
5/15/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And for us it would be unfair if we get some weird lemma because they specifically stated beforehand that you should study the pumping lemma
5/15/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: The question about the pumping lemma for us was about a^(m^2)
5/15/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: did monday ppl have pumping lemma or not
5/15/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Yes
5/15/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oh okay
5/15/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Maybe we'll just get the same kind of questions, so the same structure, but with different 'values' if that makes sense.
5/15/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hope so
5/15/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/15/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Ahh good good
5/15/17, 17:49 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: W*W
5/15/17, 17:49 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: NICE

5/15/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wat jij met je zus doet wil ik niet weten
5/15/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: jouw zus daan
5/15/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
5/15/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: maar dat wil je ook niet weten
5/15/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Guys plz

5/15/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I think it accepts all states
5/15/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: all inputs*
5/15/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah that's what I mean
5/15/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So how do I draw the matching GFA
5/15/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: So the RE is (a+b)*
5/15/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: but yeah the GFA i dunno
5/15/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah the RE I can write down haha
5/15/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just the GFA is vague
5/15/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Since the other groups name is 9jun planapp, has the date for handing in your study program been moved to the 9th of june?
5/15/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thorn, are you trolling
5/15/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: if so, good job
5/15/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: No?
5/15/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You got a mail about it?
5/15/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Oh lol didnt see the mail
5/15/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Hahaha oke will check my mailbox
5/15/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Thanks
5/15/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/15/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
5/15/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Hahaha
5/15/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Maybe after all it was a troll, who knows 🤔
5/15/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just say it is, will be much better ;p
5/15/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
5/15/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm the left drawing looks like what I have in mind
5/15/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But what is the right thingy
5/15/17, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I mean I see how that contains all steps from the left one
5/15/17, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But how is do the steps go in creating it
5/15/17, 20:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The left drawing with state 1 eliminated: G\q1
5/15/17, 20:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh that actually made it clear
5/15/17, 20:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks!
5/15/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So the basic GFA from DFA is nothing more than just arrows from every accepting state to some new endstate?
5/15/17, 20:17 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: <Media omitted>
5/15/17, 20:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ANNE IS WRONG 😱😱
5/15/17, 20:20 - Bas Gieling: i think the answer sheet is wrong
5/15/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah if Anne says the other thing then the answer sheet is probably wrong
5/15/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The answer sheet is wrong indeed
5/15/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: that's what I said ;p
5/15/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They forgot to draw 0 as accepting state, and forgot the b loop at 1 in G\q1
5/15/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But do we need to include the 1 after the ab* at the end?
5/15/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You mean the 1+ab*?
5/15/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yeah there should be 1+ab*1 right?
5/15/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: not that the 1 makes a difference if it is the empty string, but still
5/15/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: ab*1 = ab*
5/15/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah I know haha
5/15/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But not sure whether they want me to note it down
5/15/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: So do whatever you like
5/15/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Not needed
5/15/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh great, danku
5/15/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh but the answer form doesn't even make sense
5/15/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Can the regular expression for D be different from the one for G while we made G from D?
5/15/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: It can have a different notation, although they accept the Same language I think
5/15/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: (a+b)* for r_D makes sense
5/15/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Since you made G to find the regular expression from D that would be weird
5/15/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But the thing we wrote down for G is not (a+b)* right
5/15/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It doesn't look the same, but should be the same, just other notation
5/15/17, 20:30 - Bas Gieling: the thing anne wrote down is the same as (a+b)*
5/15/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Trying to figure out why though.. Since it has a's per two
5/15/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Well,you can place b's in between
5/15/17, 20:31 - Bas Gieling: you can get a single a in the right part though
5/15/17, 20:31 - Bas Gieling: and yea you can place b's in between
5/15/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hmm alrighty
5/15/17, 22:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/15/17, 22:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Like the substring is max length 2, but can also be more
5/15/17, 22:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And they're all followed by a b
5/15/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So basically if you have more than 2 a's there will come a b at some point
5/15/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Isn't that obvious?
5/15/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I think they want to say it's at least 2 a's?
5/15/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no
5/15/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think they mean that if you end with 2 a's or more you need a b to finish
5/15/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Before that it doesn't matter
5/15/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Wtf lol
5/15/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/15/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Check with the answers to be sure?
5/15/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Tomorrow ;)
5/15/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I think it is the longest string of a's in the given string of at least two a's needs to be followed by a b namely
5/15/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well no thet say EACH maximal substring of at least two a's in the given string
5/15/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not THE maximal substring
5/15/17, 23:15 - Bas Gieling: it basically says that if the last part of the word is a substring of a's, and this substring is one of the substrings with maximum amount of a's within the word, then the word ends with a b as well

i think

i mean, every substring of a's within the word is obviously followed by a b anyway, because the substring wouldnt end otherwise, unless the one that may be on the end of the word
5/15/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh what.. how do I check whether it has 3 a's when I have the string aaabaababbaaa
5/15/17, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'd need to recognize that the final substring of a's has the same amount as the highest other substring of a's
5/16/17, 00:34 - Bas Gieling: yea i have no clue
5/16/17, 00:34 - Bas Gieling: i might be wrong, thats just what i get from what it says
5/16/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: you should print the poster for USE yourself right?
5/16/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: If you hand it in via canvas in time they will print it for you
5/16/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think that if you upload it to canvas they will print it for you
5/16/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: oh thats nice
5/16/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thanks!
5/16/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: deadline is wednesday right?
5/16/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think so yeah
5/16/17, 14:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Yes just make a different accepting state for all strings
5/16/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Since these are finite the machine is finite and a dfa exists
5/16/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: When a state only has an outgoing tau transition, it does not have to take that one, right? So it can stay in that state?
5/16/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: yes
5/16/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Is this the correct DFA for mondays NFA?
5/16/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 38558225‬: Didnt it also have a c?
5/16/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: idk i made the one posted in the spam chat
5/16/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: this one
5/16/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I don't think it is correct, your starting state of the dfa you made is 1 - while the starting state should be something with 0
5/16/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Probably 0,2,3
5/16/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Besides that empty string should be accepted which is not in your dfa
5/16/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: oops
5/16/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: it has to be 0,1
5/16/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: and accepting
5/16/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: is it then correct?
5/16/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: is this assignment 50% of the interim ?
5/16/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: the initial state you mean?
5/16/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: nfa to dfa conversion
5/16/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: yes the initial state corrected is 0,1 and accepting
5/16/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: nope, the initial state should be {0,2,3}
5/16/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: because of the T transitions, you can statrt in either of those states
5/16/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: making the state {0,2,3} the full initial state
5/16/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: thats not the one i made Robin
5/16/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: But the nfa is exactly the same though
5/16/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: it should be?
5/16/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: So the dfa should be the same too
5/16/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: There are 4 states 3 of which are accepting
5/16/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: In my case
5/16/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: in the DFA?
5/16/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yes
5/16/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: There has to be an outgoing arrow for all possible moves
5/16/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Tau moves do not exist in the dfa nor do 1 or 0 moves normally
5/16/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: But my DFA is accepting for all the strings they give
5/16/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I got a dumb question
5/16/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: b+aa*b transition from state 1 to 0 (removes state 2)
5/16/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But state 2 is not an accepting state
5/16/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: which can be condensed into a*b
5/16/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or can you remove both accepting and non accepting states
5/16/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you are tryong to determine a regular expression right?
5/16/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes
5/16/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooooh wait
5/16/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I should eliminate everything that is not accepting
5/16/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good point
5/16/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you should also add a '1'-transitiom from each accepting state to a new ultimate final accepting state
5/16/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: so you shous remove every state in the end
5/16/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: *you are left without any states (apart from the final one) once you have your expression
5/16/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The final ultimate one
5/16/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: the allmighty one
5/16/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm trying it as we speak
5/16/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So far great thanks to the extensive explanation
5/16/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: np complete 👌🏻
5/16/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think I'm doing something wrong
5/16/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: my regular expression doesn't accept "a"
5/16/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: While the original DFA does
5/16/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: b*a?
5/16/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 1+b*a idk if that works
5/16/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you need 1+a on the transition from 0 to 1 in the last GFA
5/16/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: as you can go from 0 to F via 1 in the penultimate GFA
5/16/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: *via state 1
5/16/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: and you still need to eliminate state 0
5/16/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That would be a•1 then right? Since from state 0 you'd need a to get to state 1 and then the 1 gets you to F
5/16/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: the 1+ as you can also go from state 0 to E immediately
5/16/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: and I think a = a.1
5/16/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: so thats why it's 1+a I think
5/16/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oooh
5/16/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Right
5/16/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But that is when I have not yet eliminated state 0 right
5/16/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: yea
5/16/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So it would add 1+a at the final elimination
5/16/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: Im not sure what you mean
5/16/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: To the expression
5/16/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Final elimination to F is the 1+a
5/16/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So then to arrive at F we have my expression included with the 1+a part
5/16/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: sort of yea
5/16/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How do I write down that last step 🤔, one incoming arrow to state F with the full expression?
5/16/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you end up with: (b+ab+aaa*b)*(1+a)
5/16/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: woohoo
5/16/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I had that firstt part correct 😯
5/16/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: note the * at the end of the first set of brackets tho
5/16/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah because that loops to my zero state infinitely many times
5/16/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: right
5/16/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: exactly that
5/16/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or zero
5/16/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Right, thanks man! This helped a lot
5/16/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is there any mandatory way of writing it down? Or just showing the steps a bit
5/16/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: the way you did it should be fine
5/16/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: im the pic above
5/16/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: cause thats how they do it in the reader as well
5/16/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh great haha
5/16/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: What kind of questions can we expect tomorrow at the "assignment 2" part
5/16/17, 19:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 19:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The others got literally writing down the pumping lemma for some points
5/16/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And then using it for the other point
5/16/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: You first get to write down pumping lemma, then say why something is not regu lemma
5/16/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I sure hope we also get the pumping lemma haha
5/16/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Points devided 10-40-20-30
5/16/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I just think you guys get the exact same test, or maybe slight variation in 1b and 2b
5/16/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: should be fine yea
5/16/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would be nice haha
5/16/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: woopdiedoo
5/16/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Dankuzeer Eric

5/16/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Knap hoor Daan
5/16/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Maar wat is je punt?
5/16/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Spam
5/16/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Good job Daan 🙂
5/16/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nee Martin, legit vraag
5/16/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Of hij niet keihard fout was Stef
5/16/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 🤔
5/16/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Oh zo
5/16/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lemme see
5/16/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
5/16/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: eliminating  state 1 gaat al fout
5/16/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: KUT
5/16/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: bb* is ook accepting
5/16/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ja hij is wel fout
5/16/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Je moet er eerst een gfa van maken
5/16/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: En dat gaat bij stap 1 al fout zegmaar
5/16/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: [Gaat fout][Gaat seksueel][Politie gebeld][Naakte states][Gebeurt states weer]
5/16/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: dus van 1 naar E moet 1+bb* zijn
5/16/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: *0 naar E
5/16/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm ik probeer hem nog een keer
5/16/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Verdeurie
5/16/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Ik zou nog een stap opschrijven tussen zeg maar je DFA en eliminate state 1
5/16/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Eerst een GFA met vanuit alle finishing states een 1 naar F en vervolgens pas eentje elminaten
5/16/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ja bedankt idd, zo ben ik hem nu aan het doen!
5/16/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: guys, for anyone that is in group 9 of Automata and process theory, where do i have to be tomorrow? 😅
5/16/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Matrix IIRC
5/16/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: do we have different rooms tomorrow?
5/16/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Lemme look it up
5/16/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope, it is a different one
5/16/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Afaik
5/16/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i think so, just wanted to be sure
5/16/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: oh
5/16/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I could also be wrong
5/16/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nevermind
5/16/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The different room was for SDA
5/16/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So these rooms are all correct on Canvas?
5/16/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, idk for sure
5/16/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: understand ;)
5/16/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: These are correct
5/16/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Why do they say that m is arbitrary
5/16/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: According to the pumping lemma there exist a specific m for which it holds
5/16/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: and picking an arbitrary element you can only do in a proof in the case for All
5/16/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: It's the reverse of the pumping lemma
5/16/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yes but m=1 is arbitrary
5/16/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: and m=1>0
5/16/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But the pumping length for which the theorem holds can be way higher
5/16/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: so m isn't arbitrary >0
5/16/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: No arbitrary means that "for an arbitrary m" means "for any m", so when m is randomly chosen, it holds
5/16/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: so for all m
5/16/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yes I know
5/16/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: now I have randomly chosen 1
5/16/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: but the pumping length isn't 1
5/16/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: It could be 3
5/16/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: can you prove a language to be regular using to pumping lemma or can you only prove a language is not regular?
5/16/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You can only use it to prove that a language isn't regular
5/16/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thanks!
5/16/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: you can prove a regular is language
5/16/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: draw an NFA or DFA
5/16/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: would that be sufficient? no need to prove that the NFA or DFA is correct?
5/16/17, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: with the state and path set maybe
5/16/17, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Oh I think I understand
5/16/17, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Thank you
5/16/17, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ah oke thanks
5/16/17, 20:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: but a language is regular if it is accepted by an NFA
5/16/17, 20:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: and an NFA can be converted to a language equivalent DFA
5/16/17, 20:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: thus you could also draw a DFA
5/16/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: seems ok on a quick look
5/16/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pfew
5/16/17, 20:33 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: @31648187618 seems correct to me as well
5/16/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well then I have amazed myself
5/16/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Only 2.4 left to go
5/16/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: so for the test coming up, just go to the room that your group is assigned to on canvas right?
5/16/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should be the case yes
5/16/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: should be, ok...
5/16/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yeah you never know with those tutorial assigned rooms
5/16/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm getting mad at my screen now
5/16/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There is no 2 in that example anywhere
5/16/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: It's from the Lemma fam
5/16/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: you can pick it yourself
5/16/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: you have to choose a k
5/16/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: For all k>=0,xy^kz
5/16/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh right
5/16/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So I can make k huge
5/16/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then I get that small part finally
5/16/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But how do I pick xyz
5/16/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but often 0 or 2 will do the trick
5/16/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: xy pick the first part
5/16/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but make sure xy >= m
5/16/17, 21:20 - Luke Houben: <= right?
5/16/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yes
5/16/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Tell me about it we just magically and randomly decide to take square of y 🙂
5/16/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: eh yea
5/16/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Okay i got the idea with the rest of the chat
5/16/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 😬🖖🏻 but i had the same thing in my mind daan
5/16/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I always like a course until someone starts with guessing or picking stuff
5/16/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
5/16/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Ikr
5/16/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: xy should be smaller or equal to m it says, not bigger or equal
5/16/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I know there is some kind of logic but right now it looks like "apples can be red and also green but pears are mostly green and thus it isn't true
5/16/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And also tea is not coffee but deodorant comes in spray cans
5/16/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Damn you brain
5/16/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yeah
5/16/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: But the thing i dont get is, if y is a^l then when we square it why doesnt it become 2l
5/16/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: We just write m^2 +l
5/16/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oh
5/16/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I got it nvm
5/16/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Damn
5/16/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thanks isil !
5/16/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: how did you guys formulate the pumping lemma on the test?
5/16/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: in the formula or in textual form
5/16/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes
5/16/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Also can someone send me the formula one, i cant seem to find it
5/16/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It should however be prefaced by L \subset Sigma*
5/16/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
5/16/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: nice thanks
5/16/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also: On the test I'd do the formula form because more formal is more better
5/16/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: The test is just at your tutor hour location right?
5/16/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Si
5/16/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
5/17/17, 00:35 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
5/17/17, 00:36 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Hey guys this is not regular becuz m^2 + l is not square right
5/17/17, 00:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
5/17/17, 02:28 - Bas Gieling: this proof isnt right
5/17/17, 02:28 - Bas Gieling: it isnt proven for all m>0
5/17/17, 02:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Okay
5/17/17, 02:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thanks
5/17/17, 08:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well let's see whether Hans Zantema will be at Matrix 1.50
5/17/17, 08:30 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'
5/17/17, 08:31 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'm here in flux 1.07 and so many people got lost as they have never been to roel bloo
5/17/17, 08:33 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Lool
5/17/17, 08:33 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Me neither btw
5/17/17, 08:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Group 11 is pav  a12b right
5/17/17, 08:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
5/17/17, 08:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Righqt?
5/17/17, 08:35 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Right
5/17/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So how much information do you guys put on your USE poster? Shouldn't be a lot right? Just a summary of what your ideas and plans are
5/17/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: for each subject
5/17/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: We just have some key terms on which we can formulate our story
5/17/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Yeah we also use bullet points
5/17/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Formulate it as in when you present it you mean?
5/17/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Yes
5/17/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Yes
5/17/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks guys
5/17/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/17/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Needing a note from mommy to be allowed to not show your drawing to the other children in the class
5/17/17, 14:47 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: =)))
5/17/17, 14:49 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: this use course is a total joke !! (but maybe it's just me)
5/17/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: So is there like a fixed problem for your case? Because atm we came up with a problem relating to our case and are now writing a paper according to that problem using the sources
5/17/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: but it feels like there is like a problem that they meant to be used or smth since they gave you the sources that you need to use
5/17/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No, no one has any idea what the problem should be
5/17/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I dont think there is
5/17/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just come up with some problems you can think of
5/17/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's not you, it's the course ;)
5/17/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: With big data there are a lot of challenges
5/17/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: But they want one
5/17/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You can give a huge challenge and divide the subquestions into smaller challenges
5/17/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/17/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: One thing I do not get. They talk about "presenting results" and "visually represent the conclusions" while I'm pretty sure these are not finished yet considering the deadline is next week
5/17/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So you can just come up with some bogus information
5/17/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: furthermore there are no present day sources available so you should search for them yourself right?
5/17/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: It feels like they tried real hard to make a shitty course no one can understand
5/17/17, 15:07 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: yes, you have to search for present day sources, as far as i know
5/17/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah right? To me it seems like they took some elementary school history "spreekbeurt" and tried to make it fancy by adding difficult explanations for the simplest things
5/17/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: Anyone know how to split an a3 format into two a4 pdfs?
5/17/17, 15:09 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: you mean split an A2 into two A3's right ? this is what the instructions on canvas say
5/17/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha Claudiu is right
5/17/17, 15:11 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: depends on how you have the A2 file, but i used photoshop to split the picture into two halves
5/17/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: Ah oke, think that will do, thanks!
5/17/17, 15:11 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: sure, np !
5/17/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: <Media omitted>
5/17/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Did it work ?
5/17/17, 15:42 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: yes, what @31630404358 suggested works out very nicely !!
5/17/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: They said about the files: orientation Landscape, does that imply that the PDFs should be in landscape or the poster itself?
5/17/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: They said "top half and bottom half" so that implies they want the poster to be portrait
5/17/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: yeah even the illustration on the slides of our tutor session shows the poster being portrait so ill just make it portrait
5/17/17, 17:13 - Kevin Jilissen: The poster is portrait, but the two individual A3 papers should be landscape such that they can be combined into one portrait poster.
5/17/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is what it is
5/17/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/17/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Mvps if u ask me
5/17/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah exactly
5/17/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But sad to see that administration doesn't only fuck students
5/17/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: When was hti intermediate?
5/17/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Next Tuesday during tutorial
5/17/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: So what time is that?
5/17/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Fuck yeah thanks
5/17/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay so apparently @31643470096 's tutor told his USE group to NOT make a joint problem statement consisting of a main question and subquestions, but actually get a present day problem and compare that to the past in the articles
5/17/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which entirely contradicts the studyguide they swear by
5/17/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So what the heck do these hippies want us to do
5/17/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm pretty sure there should be close to no-one that knows for sure what they expect from us, and it is taking me too goddamn long to figure out their job before I can start writing down the exercises
5/17/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So are there more people who have no clue as of what to do or can someone speak up and explain it clearly and unambiguously
5/17/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Q-guy rightfully became a mess because of this, so I'm trying to avoid a school shooting
5/17/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Do we analyse the U.S.E and Governance in the past and the future for the 1st assignment or just in the past ?
5/17/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What do you mean for the first assignment
5/17/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The poster or the paper?
5/17/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Poster
5/17/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For the poster you should only do a minor analysis
5/17/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering it should fit on the poster and you just tell the rest in words
5/17/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For the essay you should do a full analysis of the past for sure, and for the presence you could explain how it differs from the past
5/17/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Future is mostly guessing and estimating so that won't matter too much I think
5/17/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Okay thank you
5/17/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Although I have in general no clue what they want exactly
5/17/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: These are just estimates as well haha
5/17/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Well thx anyhow
5/17/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: haha no problem
5/17/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: nobody has
5/17/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Where do they want us to hand in our poster and under which filename?
5/17/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: just on canvas lol
5/17/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: just call it whatever
5/17/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Aw yiss
5/17/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think it matters a bit though
5/17/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "suckonthiss_youHOES.pdf" will not entertain them
5/17/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: it would entertain me
5/17/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
5/17/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you do not know if your tutor is like me
5/17/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would sure as hell entertain me as well
5/17/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: maybe I *am* your tutor
5/17/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's some deep thinking
5/17/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: maybe im giving you +2 points for that name right now
5/17/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ideal
5/17/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We should do this more often
5/17/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: that brings your poster to a grand total of -7 points
5/17/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
5/17/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you've failed the course for no apparent reason
5/17/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: have a nice evening sir
5/17/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Can you print your poster on the uni in A2 format?
5/17/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: yes
5/17/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Because I made mine in A2 format using some program
5/17/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And they are asking for 2 A3's
5/17/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is there any way of splitting this, when it has become a PDF? 😬
5/17/17, 23:04 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Are we supposed to print poster ourselves or tutors will do it for us
5/17/17, 23:05 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Since there has to be a reason for uploading the poster
5/17/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: If you can hand it in as a PDF with 2 pages
5/17/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Then they will do it
5/17/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: If you do not hand it in before 12
5/17/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Then you have to do it yourself
5/17/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks btw :)
5/17/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: @31644497802 ↑ this was suggested earlier to split a pdf
5/17/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh thanks alot !
5/17/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Did you use publisher?
5/17/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: For creating poster in a2
5/17/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: No, libreOffice
5/17/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: i did
5/17/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Cause cheapskate
5/17/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ah
5/17/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: For me it worked to select half of the elements in the a2 pdf and i could just paste them on an a3 paper in word
5/17/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And then the other half
5/17/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And convert that doc to pdf
5/17/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You can use (in Publisher) print to PDF from the print menu, then select paper size A3, then landscape mode and your A2 file will be printed as two A3 papers
5/17/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Kudo's to @31623837581
5/17/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: :(
5/17/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Would have saved some time
5/17/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks ,this worked perfectly :)
5/18/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Anyone knows if SDC from USE is still in paviljoen, because of the mail they send last week, but it hasn't changed on mytimetable yet
5/18/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think they would send another mail when they change it back to matrix. So it's probably still in paviljoen
5/18/17, 11:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thursday May 11th-June 15th: Paviljoen U 46
5/18/17, 11:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: from the mail

5/18/17, 13:11 - Bart van Dooren: You only have to attend the one you  have to present right?

5/18/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Is it matrix or paviljoen right now?
5/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: What the hell man, why can't they just get something right for once
5/18/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Wat the fuck

5/18/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I believe that's Wednesday in the first week of the exams
5/18/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 21917788‬: Yep
5/18/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: Thanks
5/18/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: when are they going to tell us something about the programming assignment of automata. on Canvas it says that we have a deadline on June 7 and we havent heard anything of it yet
5/18/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Next week probably
5/18/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Then you have like 2 weejs
5/18/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Should be fine
5/18/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I don't think the exercises are very big, so it's also possible that they will only make the exercises available one week in advance. Erik de Vink did the same for some exercises from AI last quality
5/18/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Quartile*
5/18/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: hey guys can someone send me their poster? I'm really curious how other's turned out
5/18/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: For the USE presentation, do you have to present your poster multiple times or once?
5/18/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes
5/18/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: multiple i think
5/18/17, 14:18 - Luke Houben: For each of the other 7 groups i think
5/18/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Wow that is very clear. Thanks Rick!
5/18/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Lol ffs 7 presentations
5/18/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You're welcome!
5/18/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: You too!
5/18/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: At our tutorial they mentioned you have to presentate your poster 4 times
5/18/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think it does depend on what subject you're in. For self-driving cars I think it was only 4 presentations
5/18/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: My god
5/18/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: jeez
5/18/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: the sudy guide also says 4
5/18/17, 14:23 - Luke Houben: I think it is for every group that you are planned in with? Seems most logial to me
5/18/17, 14:24 - Luke Houben: Becuz every group comes at your table
5/18/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no
5/18/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: groups come in muliples
5/18/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: multiples
5/18/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Where in the studyguide
5/18/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you present 4 times
5/18/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: in front of multiple groups
5/18/17, 14:24 - Luke Houben: Oah
5/18/17, 14:25 - Luke Houben: Okay that could explain
5/18/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Fuck that man
5/18/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: This course gets worse by the day
5/18/17, 14:26 - Luke Houben: But yeah literally 2 minutes of presenting at your table, not even in front of the class
5/18/17, 14:26 - Luke Houben: It's not that bad, could have been worse
5/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: study guide part b i reckon
5/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i find this a lot worse
5/18/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: presenting for 15 minutes in front of the entire class is a lot better imo
5/18/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: here you can just repeat everything all the time though
5/18/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Does someone know when we will hear more about the programming exercise for automata?
5/18/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: .
5/18/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh
5/18/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Noice
5/18/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 4 times and the tutor
5/18/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what do you mean by "and the tutor"
5/18/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you have to present 4 times and the tutor!
5/18/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and the tutor what
5/18/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: And for the tutor
5/18/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well if the tutor is at the same moment as a group then it is 4 times
5/18/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For us the tutor came after the four groups
5/18/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So 5 times
5/18/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They just move randomly
5/18/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: really?
5/18/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: tutor said he'd just join another presentation
5/18/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: A heck it was just explaining in like 2-4 minutes the stuff on your poster
5/18/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah it's really messy, not scary at all
5/18/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not serious either
5/18/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not scared of any presentation really
5/18/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
5/18/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: except for when you suddenly have to do a 3 man presentation with 2 people
5/18/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31640634783

5/18/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Max is talking about something else
5/18/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh :p
5/18/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yah

5/18/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why did I spend a whole evening on that shit 😂😂
5/18/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If you didnt notice me I wouldve actually thought it was paviljoen
5/18/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Only 1% right?
5/18/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 5% of 60% of 40% so 0.05*60 = 3, 0.03*40 = 1.2%
5/18/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Assigments are 40%, we have two 20% each, then 5% of 20% is 1%
5/18/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: no, by your reason it should be 0,6
5/18/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: depends if the assignments together count as 40%, or 40% each
5/18/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Together 40%
5/18/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We haven't got statistics course yet so no worries guys
5/18/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 'yet'😂
5/18/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We will right?
5/18/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah so better already practice
5/18/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well after that you can succesfully calculate what you should get for USE
5/18/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Now you don't know statistics yet
5/18/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Before I forget, the new deadline for Planapp was 7th of June right? Because then I'll start this weekend
5/18/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 9th of June
5/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So better start 2 days after this weekend
5/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: planapp doesnt work yet
5/18/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good point
5/18/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For the presentations you have 2x2 or 2x4?
5/18/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: As in minutes
5/18/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ..?
5/18/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: C.a. 4 presentations
5/18/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Completely random amount of minutes
5/18/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 2-5 or so
5/18/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For the whole presentation
5/18/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What do you mean
5/18/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You just briefly explain what's on your poster to 3 people at a time who also have no clue to what they exactly want us to do
5/18/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's just like drinking something at home with your roommates or something
5/18/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just talk a bit, next, talk a bit and poof it's done
5/18/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: We did only present once
5/18/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Our tutor said that the four times presenting was stupid and we divided in two groups of four groups and did the presentation once
5/18/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ...
5/18/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Again the tutors do something entirely different to the study guide
5/18/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I love it
5/18/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is good stuff
5/18/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Who else is joining the USE-bash hour monday in the lunchbreak?
5/18/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Martin the Justin Timberlake tutor?
5/18/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: BTW, if Automata final exam is not going to address a lot from chapters 1 and 2, and I look at the learning material for chapters 3, 4 and 5, I'd say that exam will never take us even close to 3 hours?
5/18/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: More like 1 hour
5/18/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 4 won't be covered as well right? That's for the programming assignment if I'm right
5/18/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yeah
5/18/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exactly
5/18/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: for which I would like to get some information like right now
5/18/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/18/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Uhu
5/18/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I agree
5/18/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is it me that I cannot find an email address linked to Automata course on their Canvas page?
5/18/17, 16:23 - Luke Houben: You can just mail vink i guess
5/18/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nice, what's his email
5/18/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nvm
5/18/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh wait, not nvm
5/18/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/18/17, 16:24 - Luke Houben: Then probably e.d.vink@tue.nl i think
5/18/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ahh nope, wrong
5/18/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/18/17, 16:25 - Luke Houben: Close enough
5/18/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahah, thanks though
5/18/17, 16:26 - Luke Houben: Np!

5/18/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's too bad that we don't get an hourly wage for notifiying others of their mess
5/18/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'd be rich if you'd only include this quartile 😂
5/18/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Can anyone explain to me how to wrap a DOM-element in javascript without using jQuery?
5/18/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Is that for HTI?
5/18/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: No, just a sideproject for me :P
5/18/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Okay, well idk
5/18/17, 17:04 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: use .parentNode.insertBefore (newElement, parentElement), or sth like this ! (using jQuery would be easier)
5/18/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/18/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: good stuff general de Vink

5/18/17, 17:39 - Luke Houben: Lmao
5/18/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The presentations were fun
5/18/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: do u know if its obligatory to take 12 subjects this year

5/18/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: but are you allowed to register into 11 courses
5/18/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You can just not do them afaik

5/18/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: <Media omitted>
5/18/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: @31642007885
5/19/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How exactly do I perform my USE analysis of the past, if you consider that social media is a relatively new thing
5/19/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In the year those articles they gave us were written proper social media did not even exist
5/19/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Thats what you can analyse
5/19/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i think you have to take calling and radio and telvision as social media
5/19/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: like communication with the world
5/19/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: How did they convey messages then etc
5/19/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: which evolved to social media we know today
5/19/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ooh that makes it a bit easier
5/19/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The paper should be set among the four chosen articles and your own USE analysis of those right?
5/19/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Preferably no third party sources
5/19/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But you have to analyse the sources according to your problem statement
5/19/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What exactly does that mean (dumb question I suppose)
5/19/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Our problem statement is just some story regarding privacy
5/19/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And the issues surrounding it
5/19/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: The first assignment was to formulate a joint problem statement
5/19/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And you have to analyse the sources and answer your research question according to u s and e
5/19/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Research question not really being a question but more of a comparison between past and present for your chosen problem?
5/19/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since the tutors (asked them Thursday) said you should mainly do a nice USE analysis, and you shouldn't read the rest to litterally
5/19/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Sre the physics resit grades up already?
5/19/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: I still havent got mine
5/19/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yeah, like a week ago
5/19/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not on Osiris, they sent a mail IIRC
5/19/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I know, look what we did, was for self driving cars our question is how can self driving cars be made attractive to society. And then you analyse how users society and enterprise does that in the past and present according to your sources
5/19/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ahh right, thanks Adriano
5/19/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And our tutor said that was the correct way
5/19/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That gives me a general idea
5/19/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I can work with that
5/19/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/19/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You did it mom
5/19/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: What is cTM
5/19/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Assignment
5/19/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: classical turing machine
5/19/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: this subject really does love it's acronyms
5/19/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😏😂
5/19/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay so which language should we use
5/19/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/19/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This doesn't look familiar haha
5/19/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It's just like
5/19/17, 18:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: q0 a/a,R q1
5/19/17, 18:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Again, what?
5/19/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You are in state 0, you read an a, you place an a and move to q1.
5/19/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It says a line of code has the following form
5/19/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I would use proper Java instead of this weirdness haha
5/19/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Just take a look at the examples
5/19/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In the same file?
5/19/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh nvm found them
5/19/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Looks like boring assembly sadly
5/19/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What was the email address of Vink again?
5/19/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There's a mistake in the ctm assignment
5/19/17, 20:02 - Luke Houben: E.p.d.vink@tue.nl
5/19/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ty!
5/20/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys A5 and A6 for the ctm assignment have been updated
5/20/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So if you have any of those redownload the pdf
5/20/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Wouldn't it be nice if they didn't change the assignments after I do them -_-
5/20/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Ffs
5/20/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There was a mistake in them
5/20/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah, but for A6 they also changed what the output should be.
5/20/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: When is the deadline for those
5/20/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 20 june

5/20/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no
5/20/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: And does anyone with HTI know where the grades are? I have feedback but no grade
5/20/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i dont think they released the grades yet
5/20/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you'll get those this week
5/20/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: check the canvas announcement

5/20/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: does anyone know how to hand in those cTM assignments with the momotor thing they mention?
5/20/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: when is the deadline for the cTM?
5/20/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: like june 9th but I already finished 2 out of the three and would like to test them
5/20/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: oh thank god, because my entire next weekend will be gone
5/20/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Can you test them already?
5/20/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: @ canvas?
5/20/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That'd be nice since I've already finished them too lol
5/20/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: rubain nerd
5/20/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wow so this is not that hard at all
5/20/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nice
5/20/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not to talk bad of you, but since we got three weeks haha.
5/20/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's kinda hard lol
5/20/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Stfu you finished them last night already lol
5/20/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Finished the first one in an hour
5/20/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: It's not that bad
5/20/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: I drew them out in the train and then just entered them into a file when I got home
5/20/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what are the assignments? what do we need to do?
5/20/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's all on canvas
5/20/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Can you see the Momotor results for the 'public' questions? They're not showing up for me
5/20/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Haven't uploaded yet but will do and let you know! Can you upload more often?
5/20/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Or just once
5/20/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Yes
5/20/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Multiples
5/20/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Multipla times indeed
5/20/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Which chapter did vink do first 3 or 4?
5/20/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: In automata
5/20/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think he covered a small part of chapter 3, then went on with chapter 4
5/20/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Okay thnk you
5/20/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
5/20/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: When we have aab
5/20/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: What is the language of the cTM supposed to be?
5/20/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: It is not given in the slides but I thought that the ones accepted are the ones which we can halt on with no remainder  in the string
5/20/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: But it seems it's not the case
5/20/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Well that's true, but then I don't know what you mean. You can't reach q9 when you start with "aab"
5/20/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Well if u start with aab at q0 , we will reach q2 with #### according to the slides 
So we can apply the transition from q2 to q9
5/20/17, 19:20 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: What I am not really sure why it reports a no then
5/20/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah, that seems correct, but when it goes to q9 it replaces # by N so it reports no, right?
5/20/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yes it reports a No then
5/20/17, 19:24 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Hey, guess what, Erik made another mistake in the slides, causing further confusion!
5/20/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I thought so too 😅
But i didnt want to rush into that conclusion
5/20/17, 21:12 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: about the momotor thing, I don't think it has been activated yet for our course. I found this online https://momotor.org/doc/lti/_images/default_nav.png and it looks like it will be a seperate tab within the canvas course when they enable it. so for now I guess I won't be able to test my solutions yet great.
5/20/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: We have a jar file where you can type it in and simulate it though?
5/20/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Do you guys know the syntax for "skip all symbols" instead of writing 10 lines with, a/a,R b/b,R etc
5/20/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yes please someone
5/20/17, 21:56 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: sigma^*
5/20/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: And does anyone know what is meant with exercise B8?
5/20/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: <Media omitted>
5/20/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you basically have 2 accepted states
5/20/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: but both have different results
5/20/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: or just the general statement
5/20/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: from nonaccepting you have an outgoing state for the empty input
5/20/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: for the rest it's just maths
5/20/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: lenght of y is the same as length of a multuple of x^(anything)
5/20/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: oh no it's the end of x is equal to y
5/21/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
5/21/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: oh wait nevermind
5/21/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: could they have an imput of w1*w2*w2*?
5/21/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: with an extra star at the end?
5/21/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
5/21/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: It cant start with 1 followed by N1 yes ?
5/21/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It can be either. This says that N can be any combination of 1's and 0's, but it has to start with a 1
5/21/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ahhh okay so we always take the 1st symbol + any of the ones that come after
5/21/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Thx !
5/21/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: No, you can "replace" the N by any of the symbols
5/21/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: So for example if it was
N -> 1 | 0 | N0 | N1
then N can be any sequence of 0's and 1's (so it can start with a zero or a one)
5/21/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I thought it should start always with a 1
5/21/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Well that's the result of what it says. But literally, it means that you can replace N by 1, N0, or N1. So for instance, you can 'create' N -> N1 -> N01 - > 101
5/21/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Okay 
Thanks
5/21/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: hey guys, in the turing assignments of mathematical expression, im doing binary adding but is the alphabet restricted to 0,1 and # or can i use other letters as well?
5/21/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: The input and output are in those alphabets but you can use any other symbols to make your machine work
5/21/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: great, thanks!
5/21/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: Yes. They can, but then the output must be N
5/22/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Anyone who has C2?
5/22/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: nee
5/22/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yes
5/22/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: My solution tries to remove one a, one b, and one c from the word every time. Then if at some point there are only a's left, it makes everything as. Same thing for b's. Otherwise it will turn everything into c's.

5/22/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Roel bloo is slow af
5/22/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For the cTM Automata assignment, how do you say which are accepting states and failing states?
5/22/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: (the latter can just loop infinitely of course)
5/22/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: There don't exist accepting states
5/22/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: It just halts
5/22/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Just termination

5/23/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Do you just let it automatically with 'automatisch aanvullen' or do you manually type in everything?
5/23/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Clear all cookies, reboot your pc?
5/23/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: because I accidentally saved the HTI code thing as my password and that's why everything stopped working zz
5/23/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: My laptop did the same
5/23/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Which was really annoying, because I couldn't figure out why I couldn't login haha
5/23/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: I've been using it after the test for a while
5/23/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Don't think that's the case but I'll clear everything and stuff
5/23/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Nope still not it
5/23/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You had this one time, right @31658856924?
5/23/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: The problem solved itself
5/23/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Thanks anyway guys!
5/23/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: You're welcome
5/23/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: <Media omitted>
5/23/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I think it has to do with the length
5/23/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: No, because z can be any length
5/23/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It appears or be nothing more than that the part before the * must also be the last part of the word
5/23/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: yeah thats what i meant
5/23/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Exactly
5/23/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: thnx
5/23/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oehh B8
5/23/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I know that one
5/23/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it is this
5/23/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: can confirm
5/23/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: can confirm that Stef can confirm
5/24/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
5/24/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good question
5/24/17, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Looks like it
5/24/17, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: Yes. That is correct.
5/24/17, 09:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lel
5/24/17, 09:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How logical
5/24/17, 09:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The rest should be blanks?
5/24/17, 09:09 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
5/24/17, 09:27 - Luke Houben: Do others who took the physics resit also don't have their grades uploaded to osiris yet?
5/24/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: yup
5/24/17, 09:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I cant log in to canvas now anymore
5/24/17, 09:42 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: or any tue service for that matter
5/24/17, 09:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: guess thats on ur side, i still can
5/24/17, 09:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and thanks guys
5/24/17, 09:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: better find out now lel
5/24/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: I had the same for a moment Tobin, but retrying worked for me. Most likely it is occasional
5/24/17, 09:59 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: ah yeah its working now
5/24/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: <Media omitted>
5/24/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: this set defines a set of Rules but what does the set actually contain?
5/24/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This looks like one of those lemma's that seems way too hard on paper but is actually understandable in English or Dutch
5/24/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: You take all the normal rules you already had. Then for each rule where some of the output variables are nullable, you add all possible combinations of using the nullable variable, or the empty string instead of that variable
5/24/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: So if S -> AB and A and B are nullable, you end up with:
S -> AB | A | B | epsilon
5/24/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: ah I think I understand, thanks!
5/24/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: why the 'oh wait nvr mind' a message later Sander? you should still be able to immediately remove it right?

5/25/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: For visualising the cTM, what do they mean with "Edit the file "config.cfg" for the right location "dot" binary in the graphviz installation"?
5/25/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: have you found config.cfg?
5/25/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
5/25/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright, open it in a text editor
5/25/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk notepad or something
5/25/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Done that, also opened found the dot.exe file
5/25/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: at the bottom of the file it should say like DOT_LOCATION_HERE or something like that
5/25/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dont remember what it said for sure
5/25/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: delete that and insert a path to the dot file
5/25/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you know like :C\Documents\Graphviz\bin\someothermap\dot
5/25/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or something like that
5/25/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if you right click and select properties on the dot file you should be able to see the path
5/25/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Thanks, that works!
5/25/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: No problemo 👍🏽
5/25/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Anyone knows at the cTM assignment is the location of the head matter when the TM has halted?
5/25/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: First symbol
5/25/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Thnx🤙🏾
5/25/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hmm mine halts on a blank left/right of symbol at times
5/25/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For instance when you have to put a Y / N down
5/25/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There is an S command that you could use instead of L/R but it is not mentioned anywhere..
5/25/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: my hero
5/25/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: We're not allowed to use the S command for the assignment. You can solve it by going left and adding a state inbetween that just goes right regardless ot the symbol.
5/25/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: regardless of*
5/25/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So you cannot end on a blank but have to end on that y?
5/25/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: I don't know if we can end on the blank.
5/25/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: But you can fake a stay by going left then right.
5/25/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I know but then you would have to add in another state and another transition which would make it less efficient again
5/25/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Guys, for the cTM assignment, I'm making a python program that you can use to check your machine on loads of inputs really quickly, or just checking it against all inputs (up to a certain length). Of you want, I will see if I can upload it to cs-students or something
5/25/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yes please
5/25/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
5/25/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Could someone help me out on this?
5/25/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I really don't get what they're doing here
5/25/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Nvm
5/25/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: Hey, guys, do you know if the library is open tomorrow?
5/25/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: I believe everything is closed. You might still be able to get in though
5/25/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Its closed
5/25/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: Thank you
5/25/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: Is it true that with USE ICT and Social Media you are only allowed to use the sources given + one source you find yourself?
5/25/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I hope not
5/25/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: We have multiple sources that we found ourselves
5/25/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I doubt it, more sources is always better
5/25/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: But when writing about the past, present day sources of course do not really help your point
5/25/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: All tutors say different things and it should be allowed to use any source
5/26/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: For the Turing machine can I use other letters then in my language?
5/26/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
5/26/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I want to mark a "c" with a capital "C" to say I processed it
5/26/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Can I do this?
5/26/17, 15:15 - Casper Smits: of course, why not?
5/26/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yes, you can use any other symbols you want
5/26/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Because they mention the tape alphabet involved
5/26/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And I wanted to be sure
5/26/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
5/26/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Tape alphabet is different from language alphabet
5/26/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Alright :)
5/26/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: You found at least 2 USER, 2 SOCIETY, 2 ENTERPRISE, and 2 Governance challenges
of the past and for the future
5/26/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: does this mean we need 2 total per USEG case, or 2 for the past, and 2 for the future per USEG case?
5/26/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Two past/future can overlap
5/26/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so 2 in total?
5/26/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: where did you get that from btw?
5/26/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Bullshitting
5/26/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just pick two from both past and present
5/26/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If they overlap so be it
5/26/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Even the tutors have no clue for this
5/26/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: I'm assuming that it isn't per time period. Otherwise you'd be writing 2 reports. The idea is that you take a current day challenge and that you relate this to the same challenge then or a similar challenge.
5/26/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: The similar challenge being the second one, I would assume.
5/26/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: But again, no certainty.
5/26/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ugh
5/26/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so confusing
5/26/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: I get that more often
5/26/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: this was for the synthesis btw
5/27/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: who has A1 for CTM
5/27/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: ✋🏻
5/27/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: ☝🏻
5/27/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: its very similiar to the example in chapter 4 at page 23 right 🤔
5/27/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Can we use letters like P and stuff
5/27/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oki nvm i thought my code didnt work becuz i used letters
5/27/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ye you can
5/27/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Das kut

5/27/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: badger cunt
5/27/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: +1
5/27/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i was having some problems but i solved it
5/27/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 😀
5/27/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: How many states did you use
5/27/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 14
5/27/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: you
5/27/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31643222030 @31611753688  @31624553225  don't spam
5/27/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I used 12 for the main thing and a 13th state to get the pointer to the first symbol
5/27/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i added one to remove zeros
5/27/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: in the beggining if exists
5/27/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Yeah thats my 12th state
5/27/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: u smart
5/27/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Is there actual documentation available on the CTM assignment now?
5/27/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I already heard something about the S thing instead of L and R
5/27/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Since cTM is defined in paragraph 4.2 with only L and R, it would be weird if they give a new definition including S, although it would be a lot more convenient
5/27/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: I asked
5/27/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Your not allowed to use S
5/27/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: YOU'RE******
5/27/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Agreed
5/27/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guys, for USE ethics part paper, will we get assigned in new groups
5/27/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ?
5/27/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I don't think so
5/27/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Rip daan
5/27/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay then I'm gonna be mailing
5/27/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is a no go
5/27/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Why? What's wrong?
5/27/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Gettin close to zero response for weeks and now minor activity and weak excuses near the deadline
5/27/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: honestly i think there's a lot of people doing that
5/27/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I 100% agree with Daan
5/27/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: This is really fucking annoying
5/27/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: as long as its done in time and the quality is good its not that big of a deal i think
5/27/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: I don't think anyone has proper motivation for USE.
5/27/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yeah it is
5/27/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: thats what i meant
5/27/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i get how its annoying if everyone is ignoring you
5/27/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Not having proper motivation doesn't mean you can ignore your group members
5/27/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's half assed work which I have to finish and paste together
5/27/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: that actively try to work on it
5/27/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: im not motivated to do this bs subject
5/27/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: thats why i wanna finish it early
5/27/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: unlucky
5/27/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: and be done with the shit
5/27/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i understand nick
5/27/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: me too
5/27/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: deadline croppers are the worst
5/27/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: especially in a group
5/27/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: last minute whores
5/27/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you like ignoring group members when they actively try to help you pass the course as well since you suck, honestly fuck you
5/27/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pick a train that is not mine and be done with it

5/27/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Is the synthesis really only 600 words? Because describing 6 tensions already comes to that I would say
5/27/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maybe they want the 6 tensions just described briefly? If that would make it fit..
5/27/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Well for every tension they already want: Explanation + 
 Explain what governance model was used to identify/make choices. What choices did the USE playing field produce? (and which alternative options did it marginalize?)
5/27/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: darn...
5/27/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Which makes it pretty impossible if they also want all the other conclusions
5/27/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Uhm, we took tensions that had overlap between multiple parts. So that in the synthesis was more of a globalising one
5/27/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: at least you can already write it😭
5/27/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We went over the 600 words
5/27/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Not by an extreme amount
5/27/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: RIP
5/27/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: just end us already
5/27/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: what I did is explain the challenges greatly, and mention the challenges based on that, allowing for a shorter explanation on the tensions
5/27/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: And with the tensions they ask for a governance model? What do they mean with that, what can you choose from?
5/27/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Participative or technocratic model
5/27/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Thanks
5/28/17, 04:14 - ‪+31 6 14508988‬ left
5/28/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/28/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The part I'm struggling with is how to subtract multiple symbols from one side while keeping track of how many exactly, without removing them on the other side
5/28/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You can mark each digit of w, and simultaneously mark a digit for v for each digit you mark for w. When all the digits of w are marked and you didn't run out of digits of v, add a 1 somewhere on the tape for your division result. Then remove the marks from w and continue
5/28/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ahh the marks
5/28/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm trying way too hard to not alter the tape
5/28/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks again Anne!
5/28/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do we need to keep into account some test that enters random symbols you didn't use?
5/28/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: like 111#112p  in this case
5/28/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Guys for A1 of automata can we expect them to troll us an only give 1 number (so the other one #)?
5/28/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i dont think we are supposed to make error states
5/28/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i mean we should expect properly given operation
5/28/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Yeah but it is not specified whether a number could be blank
5/28/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Just that its a nonnegative binary
5/28/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: they can give 0
5/28/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: but not blank
5/28/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: im sure they would specify
5/28/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: if they wanted something like that
5/28/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Ooh wait
5/28/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Non empty totally read over it sorry
5/28/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oh no problem
5/28/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Are there 6 online tests for use and they take only the best 5 ?
5/28/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Or are they 5 and they count them all ?
5/28/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 13825397‬: This
5/28/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Wait
5/28/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ok thx
5/28/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Was there a use test for today
5/28/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I have one that is due on the 29th of May 23.59
5/28/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: nah
5/28/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I'll do it today then, to be sure
5/28/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Sorry 30 May 23.59 *
5/28/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: <Media omitted>
5/28/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: And does anyone know if the plan-app is already working properly to submit your plan?
5/28/17, 21:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: GUYS  important questions when we submit our use documentation do we also submit the poster?
5/28/17, 21:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Or just the report
5/28/17, 21:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🤓
5/28/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: both
5/28/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: poster is an annex
5/28/17, 21:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thanks
5/28/17, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should we add it as a seperate file or include it in the PDF?
5/28/17, 21:39 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: They have our poster already right
5/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: We're we supposed to improve the poster also?
5/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but they're stupid
5/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no
5/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No they lost it or something
5/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Didn't handle their customer data correctly
5/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Jej
5/29/17, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
5/29/17, 09:10 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Yes, they did. But these exams were from gerard zwaan. The exams from erik vink consist of mostly proofs (sadly)
5/29/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh really :(
5/29/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Uuuugh
5/29/17, 09:23 - Luke Houben: I thought it was the other way around
5/29/17, 09:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No that is not the case 😂
5/29/17, 09:25 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Unless they just mean the pumping lemmas
5/29/17, 09:25 - Luke Houben: Well fuck
5/29/17, 09:36 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/2it70/

2 previous exams are on the bottom of the page and they only have 2 proofs (besides the pumping lemna one), so it's not that bad
5/29/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: old exams were made by gerard zwaan
5/29/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: our one will be made by erik
5/29/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the old exams are NOT that good of an example
5/29/17, 09:38 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think they just mean the pumping lemmas and the lemmas like 'for every DFA there exists an NFA that accepts the same language'
5/29/17, 09:38 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Hmm I thought that gerard made the ones for his automata course, not this onec since this is erik's page
5/29/17, 09:39 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: So you'll have to prove that languages are not regular/context-free, and create language-equivalent DFAs etc
5/29/17, 09:42 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: We however can find exams made Erik I guess
5/29/17, 09:43 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: They are not provided I think because they are almost the same each year
5/29/17, 09:43 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: At least this is what I've heard from ppl taking this course from Erik in previous years
5/29/17, 09:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: How do we find these "exams made Erik"?
5/29/17, 09:47 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Idk maybe somewhere in the web
5/29/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Here
5/29/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: For the people who are gonna do the security package, how did you deal with Operating Systems and Algebra for Security being in the same timeslot?
5/29/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Did you move one of them to year 2?
5/29/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If you don't have anything in timeslot C in Y2Q1, you can move operating systems
5/29/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: it's timeslot E, but that one is open for me so I'll do that then, thanks!
5/29/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Also, as 2IF80 is still not in the planapp, should I create a new subject and just name it correctly?
5/29/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Can you do security and IIS together without doing 4 courses in 1 quartile?
5/29/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: suppose not right
5/29/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope
5/29/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: If you have already done Computer Graphics this year you can, but quite a mess
5/29/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: <Media omitted>
5/29/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Where you can ofc pick a different USE, as well as 2 different electives for Y3Q3&4 than I have
5/29/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Does it all work by now? Then I'll create my choicelist haha
5/29/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: security package still does not have the correct subjects in it
5/29/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: looks like a damn mess
5/29/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but if it works sure
5/29/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31649673225 check this out
5/29/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL, didn't they say they would release those next week, like four weeks ago
5/29/17, 13:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: hey guys who has a4 cb2 c1
5/29/17, 13:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: a4 b2 c1
5/29/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyone with b7?
5/29/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: A4, B7, C2 here
5/29/17, 13:52 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what is your plan with a4 ?
5/29/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you done B7 yet?
5/29/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm gonna use a push down automata i think
5/29/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I was thinking about using a quantum computer
5/29/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But that might be a bit overkill
5/29/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: Basically this for a4
5/29/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol it would work tho
5/29/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: No haven't done b7 yet
5/29/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
5/29/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: imma do the push down thing
5/29/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No quantum?
5/29/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Isn't the whole idea of the assignment to use a cTM?
5/29/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah but fuck that im gonna make my tape into a stack
5/29/17, 14:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ok for a4 I can do integer division but how do we write down the modulo after we see that there is no 1 left in v ?
5/29/17, 14:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: for example with 111#11
5/29/17, 14:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: we would have  _www#ww when we notice that there is no 1 left in v
5/29/17, 14:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: how do we reverse the number to the exact amount of 1 left in order to get the modulo?
5/29/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: basicly I don't get how to return it from _www#ww to 1ww#11 in order to ge the modulo 1?
5/29/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: the modulo part is cancer for me:{
5/29/17, 14:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: do I do it with step by step doing exactly the opposite of what I did until I get only 1's in w?
5/29/17, 14:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: also I think I shouldn't use w as a processed mark :D
5/29/17, 14:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: anyone?🐢
5/29/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: For the mod I considered 3 cases, 
1. W fits perfectly in V mod=0
2. W does not fit in V at all, mod=w
3. W fits x times in V, mod needs to be calculated
5/29/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: For the calculation you should just count the unmarked symbols of w
5/29/17, 14:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yeah but.... with this ? 111#11
5/29/17, 14:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: at one point you will get  mmm#1m?
5/29/17, 14:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and when you mark the 1 in w and got to v to search for another 1 to mark too
5/29/17, 14:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what happens then?
5/29/17, 14:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: you see that there is no 1 left?
5/29/17, 14:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: how do you count the unmarked 1 is w when there si none of the?
5/29/17, 14:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: like what am I doing wrong ?
5/29/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: If you first mark in w, then check in V, see that it doesn't fit, mod will be unmarked w symbols + 1
5/29/17, 15:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so what happens with 1111#111
5/29/17, 15:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: it gets to 1mmm#111
5/29/17, 15:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: then it goes to  _mmmm#11m
5/29/17, 15:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: pretty sure mod is not 111?
5/29/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: Scratch this, my approach is that mod will be marked symbols in w - 1, so the other way around
5/29/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
5/29/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Does anyone have an idea of how to do this on
5/29/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: One*
5/29/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: C2
5/29/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I got that one
5/29/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Hey me too cant figure out how to approach
5/29/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Mine tm reads till it sees an a or b and then search for an pair
5/29/17, 19:18 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If it doesnt find a matching pair anymore then it knows it has to change te whole string to a's or b's
5/29/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: How do you keep track of the amount of a's or b's
5/29/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Otherweis it has to change the string to c's
5/29/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Not
5/29/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: It goes from left to right and if it sees an a it searches for a b somewhere else and vice versa
5/29/17, 19:20 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: For example if it sees an a and no b anymore then there are more a's then b's
5/29/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: But if it finds an a and a b and then cant find any more then the amount is equal
5/29/17, 19:23 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thank u i have some kind of an idea now 😀
5/29/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: With the ctm exercise, are you allowed to use your own marker symbols?
5/29/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i guess i hope becuz i did
5/29/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I did
5/29/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Im struggling as Well
5/29/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Had Kinda the same idea as Thomas, just struggling with working it out
5/29/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah i am trying that too
5/29/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Don't we all
5/29/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: K
5/29/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: The way I did it is by removing one a, one b and one c each time and storing if there was still one. Then I check if there was still an a and no other letter, then fill everything with a's, etc
5/29/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: That's a good tactic tbh
5/29/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I'm gonna try it in a bit
5/29/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It worked for me, but I am not sure if it is the most simple solution
5/29/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: There's still 2 weeks to tweak some stuff anyway
5/29/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: But thanks!

5/30/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'd say b
5/30/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "or do anything wrong" basically says they didn't do anything haha
5/30/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: i'd say C

5/30/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: is violated
5/30/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because not doing anything is not doing anything wrong, but you could still be held accountable
5/30/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I had that question and chose b, I got 9/10
5/30/17, 13:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: "C" in book says the persons is still blamed since he/she had a choice
5/30/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: So b gives you 90% chance :P

5/30/17, 13:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I was thinking "a" just because of the guys who first worked for nazi and then helped American spaceship program
5/30/17, 13:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guy*
5/30/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I had 9/10 and had b

5/30/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: make a bet max XP
5/30/17, 13:59 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: In order to be blamed for something, someone needs to have done
something wrong. There needs to be a line that was crossed, or you
could not prove that someone was in the wrong. There needs to be
agreement that someone neglected a certain law or moral value. -----Thats what summary says just saw
5/30/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alrighty then
5/30/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that would mean I'm an idiot
5/30/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You are
5/30/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Wasn't this known already?

5/30/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That's proves the point even more though
5/30/17, 14:05 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Got a 10! Thanks guys!! It was a "b" afterall
5/30/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Rekt?

5/30/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I like that cuttingboard
5/30/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: move to spamchat guys
5/30/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: How can I prepare for the use final test ? 
I was told that  they will give us a book at some point which the exam will be based on , is that true ?
5/30/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: There are books
5/30/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
5/30/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
5/30/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yeah i know 😅
I meant that the final test will be based on a book different from those
5/30/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: This is what I was told so I wanted to make sure
5/30/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That would be weird
5/30/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Studyguide only mentions these 2 as exam readings
5/30/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Well then i guess u r right
5/30/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: a list of key concepts of the ethics book will be provided on canvas according to the study guide
5/30/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Okay then 👍
5/31/17, 00:00 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬ removed ‪+31 6 42623926‬
5/30/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: how is momotor accessed?
5/30/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: You can't yet.
5/30/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: They've added the Momotor page but there are no assignments in it yet
5/30/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: ah ok. I thought there's some other way besides going to the Momotor tab on canvas
5/30/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: You'll see the exercise there when you can submit
5/30/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: Momotor is working now
5/30/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
5/30/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: works for me
5/30/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: should you first hand them in?
5/30/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: ...
5/30/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ofcoarse
5/30/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: Hand them in via the assignments tab
5/30/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ohh in that matter
5/30/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For me it is still not workingbtw
5/30/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: If you have done that you can see the result in the momotor tab
5/30/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What browsers are you guys using?
5/30/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: chrome
5/30/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: Firefox 53.0.3
5/30/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For me it still gives the Session expired error
5/30/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Same
5/30/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: do you get instant feedback?
5/30/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: no
5/30/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: you have to wait a minute or 2
5/30/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: same as peach
5/30/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: jammer
5/30/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: "Queuing processing etc."
5/30/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: do u get the 4 secret answers aswell or no
5/30/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: no just the first 5 i think
5/30/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: hmm ok
5/30/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: handed it in, still says session expired
5/30/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Same for me Sander
5/30/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I handed it in quite some ago already
5/30/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Restarted browser etc
5/30/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I had to authorize it first
5/30/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: dunno if that helps
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If I open it in chrome it works
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Prolly some plugin that's messing around
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Do I just hand the assignments in randomly?
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Opened it up in chrome and worked instantly
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Or is there a naming scheme/order to it
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: If the names are correct i think
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Yeah naming
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Ax, Bx, Cx
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: What names should they be then?
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: where x are the assignments numbers
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Ooh
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: and they must be .ctm
5/30/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Alrighty
5/30/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: So for me it was A6.ctm, B3.ctm, C3.ctm
5/30/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Wait, didn't Erik say that if you submitted your solutions via canvas you'd have to submit them again via Momotor?
5/30/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Whatevs we still have 2 weeks
5/30/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Because I only uploaded them via canvas, and there are already results on Momotor
5/30/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Just for checking this is great
5/30/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Afaik not Hugo
5/30/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Oh Lord I think I would be faster processing this shit manually
5/30/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Just with pen and paper would be faster tbh
5/30/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: That should be Momotor's motto really
5/30/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: He did say something like that
5/30/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: >all this processing power, yet you still can't make software that efficiently checks classical Turing machines on which the PC itself is based
5/30/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: They probably have it set up so that for each test it has to compile the entire emulator again, or something stupid like that
5/30/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Plot twist, the server is actually a pp2 processor
5/30/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: A student set it up after all...
5/30/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: That would explain so much
5/30/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Wait a min
5/30/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: If they forgot a timer
5/30/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Its solving the halting problem right now
5/30/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: Erik scheffers, my embedded systems tutor made this with Tom verhoeff
5/30/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Erik was also my tutor
5/30/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: He seems like a guy who know what he's doing
5/30/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But it also increases the chance of the server being a pp2 processor🤔

5/30/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no, john
5/30/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it seems like momotor only sees output on and right of the pointer
5/30/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that's a glitch, mail them about it
5/30/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: gg rick

5/30/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Well they should've clearly indicated this during Automata too, because there are enough people who didn't take fundamentals
5/30/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: can confirm that momoter is stupid af
5/30/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: oh not bad i overlooked it then
5/30/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: when you end up with a single symbol it reads from where the pointer is located
5/30/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i changed it already so im gonna hand it in again
5/30/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Good job John
5/30/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well done
5/30/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: which is empty because you move either left or right after setting the output
5/30/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: They do mention your Turing machine should follow the standards in the reader somewhere but yeah I agree
5/30/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: now just wait three and a half months and momotor should have put it out of the queue and started processing
5/30/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I see
5/30/17, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: So, we agree that your input needs to be left of your pointer when it terminates?
5/30/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ye
5/31/17, 00:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: On the right
5/31/17, 00:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Pointer needs to be on leftmost symbol
5/31/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thats what i meant
5/31/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: should it be ON the leftmost symbol or can it also be on the blank left of the leftmost symbol?
5/31/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: ON
5/31/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ugh fuck sake
5/31/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: can we not mail them about this?
5/31/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its not mentioned anywhere
5/31/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: why ON lol
5/31/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jeez
5/31/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah
5/31/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: max
5/31/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so seems like it a glitch
5/31/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: take the liberty to mail erik de vink
5/31/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that only makes it easier
5/31/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: he usually replies within the hour
5/31/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not for every case
5/31/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: im still in bed
5/31/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: can someone not go to him in the lecture break?
5/31/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: when you have to replace the full string with Y or N you always end left/right of the letter
5/31/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so that basically means an extra state just to get it ON the letter
5/31/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah i see
5/31/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬ added ‪+31 6 42623926‬
5/31/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i will send him a mail then max pfff
5/31/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Yeah indeed, I also got a little bit confused about it before realizing I had to add an extra state just to get on the last symbol
5/31/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <3
5/31/17, 10:32 - Bart van Dooren: <Media omitted>
5/31/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: -128 is not possible
5/31/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz ur limited to 8 bits
5/31/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but for -127 the output should be -1111111
5/31/17, 10:33 - Bart van Dooren: okay thanks :)
5/31/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or actually 7 bits for 1's and 0's, 1bit is taken for the - sign
5/31/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so that gives u a range of 0 to 127
5/31/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: shit
5/31/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
5/31/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: on the ones they show yes
5/31/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: probz they run like 30 tests
5/31/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Public answers only
5/31/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How do I know wheter they passed on all tests then?
5/31/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: you donht
5/31/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ffs why not
5/31/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: just like with programming in first quartile
5/31/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: you dont get to see all tests
5/31/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Just say I passed but dont give input/output tested
5/31/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz if ur program is good it passes anyway
5/31/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: could have been a possibility
5/31/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but they dont like us
5/31/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so nah
5/31/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Meh
5/31/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Okay
5/31/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
5/31/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: umm
5/31/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: insanely fast reply
5/31/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: dat wel idd
5/31/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: ja dit nog niet echt iets
5/31/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: dit doet nog *
5/31/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: vanaf de tapehead
5/31/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is dat including tapehead?
5/31/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Want dan moet je dus op de Y / N beginnen
5/31/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Als het excluding is kun je ook 1 links van de Y/N beginnen
5/31/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ja not sure man
5/31/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ik vind het niet echt een conclusive antwoord ofzo lol
5/31/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: "ja het klopt niet"
5/31/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: dat is het antwoord
5/31/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: maar wat ik er uit kan opmaken is
5/31/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: vanaf de tapehead tot de eerste blank is uitvoer, dus dan zou ik zeggen dat als je m op de blank links zet dat ie dan geen uitvoer leest
5/31/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: dus dat het OP het symbool moet staan en niet er naast...
5/31/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: Can someone give me the email of the study council? The address book on the mobile website is not working
5/31/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Is the momotor thing shaking as fuck for others as well?
5/31/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Guyys doe niet moeilijk en add die ene state, op het boek staat op het meest linker symbol
5/31/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: In het boek*
5/31/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Heb ik al schattebout
5/31/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Wtf the momotor program gives different results than the ctm.jar
5/31/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: for the exact same input it has a different output
5/31/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Where does your stack pointer end?
5/31/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: well now ive changed it to end on the first symbol and it now processing forever
5/31/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hmm
5/31/17, 11:23 - Bart van Dooren: same here processing for about 30 min already ;/
5/31/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 31292764‬ left
5/31/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pom, pom, pom
5/31/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Another one bites the dust
5/31/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: How many students do we still have?
5/31/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 17

5/31/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So I'd say 200¿
5/31/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How many did we start with
5/31/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Weeaboos unite!
5/31/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wait what 😛

5/31/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬ removed ‪+31 6 29323398‬
5/31/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: About 300
5/31/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This year we are probably getting around 400
5/31/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: can i find final exam for automata
5/31/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well I know Nick can
5/31/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But whether you can I'm not sure
5/31/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am pretty sure that you can, as long as you belive in yourself.
5/31/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Never lose hope
5/31/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Since you probably meant to ask where to find them: try cs-students.nl, gewis.nl/education, canvas.tue.nl or the course page of Erik Vink

5/31/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So at the end of the lecture vink showed the score of the test of the cTM's
5/31/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: From all 30 tests🤔
5/31/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what?
5/31/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what test?
5/31/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Huh
5/31/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The momoter one I guess
5/31/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what do you mean
5/31/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it doesnt make sense
5/31/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what did he test
5/31/17, 12:52 - Luke Houben: The 3 ctm assignments
5/31/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: His ctm probably
5/31/17, 12:52 - Luke Houben: He opened a page with ones name and the score behind it
5/31/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: theres, like, 20 ctm assignments
5/31/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not 3
5/31/17, 12:53 - Luke Houben: The 3 you have been assigned
5/31/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: he showed specifically the ones i have been assigned?
5/31/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Personal score of how your 3 programs you wrote did on the test
5/31/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That is if you handed Them in
5/31/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ahhhh i see
5/31/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i was gonna say i havent even handed mine in yet
5/31/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but i see now
5/31/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: sorry 😅
5/31/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: how do you submit your ctm assignments? just like you do with all other assignments or is there a special momotor-way?
5/31/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you hand them in via 'assignments' just like always
5/31/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: only after youve handed them in you can test them using momotor
5/31/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
5/31/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nah
5/31/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys, I have the binary addition assignment.
5/31/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Can i put 0 and 1 into 1 spot
5/31/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Or 0,1 and blank
5/31/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: So they all are subset of 1 letter
5/31/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Just like in figure 4.13 of the reader ?
5/31/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: if you mean 'can i write 1 line instead of 8' then no
5/31/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you can replace them with the same symbol
5/31/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Is that nt possible?
5/31/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you can change the 0 and a 1 both to an e if you'd like
5/31/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but afaik you cannot have the state always go left or always go right *except* if you see an 0 fore xample
5/31/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you have to type it out for every possible symbol
5/31/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Moet ik nou gewoon alle regels opschrijve
5/31/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Kutding
5/31/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: ja hahaha
5/31/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: if not please enlighten me guys
5/31/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ill wait for the enlightening
5/31/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: xd
5/31/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Wtf lmao
5/31/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
5/31/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: example: aaabaaa
needs to be 3210123
5/31/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: aabbabaa
needs to be
21001012
5/31/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: the a's represent the distance from the nearest b in the string
5/31/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: which is at most 3
5/31/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: aaaaah
5/31/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i see
5/31/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: thank you
5/31/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: and there has to be at least 1 b in the string and 1b per 3 a's(i believe)
5/31/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I assume a score of 6 is the maximum in Momotor (1point for each of the 6 shown tests)
5/31/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yes
5/31/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: ah ty
5/31/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But There are 24 more tests hidden
5/31/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: When should we register for the P examm
5/31/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: When you got all your ECTS for year 1
5/31/17, 17:49 - Luke Houben: So just 60 ECTS or really from all the 1st year courses?
5/31/17, 17:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Wasn't it mentioned that we have to register for it on in advance
5/31/17, 17:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Like before it happened if sure it's gonna happen
5/31/17, 17:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You're sure*
5/31/17, 17:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Also, guys 
I have a question

Just wanted to check whether it's ok or not ok
5/31/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 1st year courses
5/31/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Yeah
5/31/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: It will just test that one
5/31/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: And you can always resubmit
5/31/17, 17:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What is this P test any quick info
5/31/17, 17:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thanks!
5/31/17, 18:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Anyone ? ^
5/31/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It's not really a test. It's listed as an 'exam', but you just have to register it so they know they should check if you completed your first year
5/31/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's the Propedeuse diploma you get when having 60 points dimi
5/31/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Abbreviated to "P"
5/31/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Pass all your first year subjects and you pass the p test
5/31/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But for foreign students they need to prepare a speech in French as well
5/31/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Else you don't get it
5/31/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: True
5/31/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I heard that it's one of the most difficult parts of the p test
5/31/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: What
5/31/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Except if you're French ofc
5/31/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: French??
5/31/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Phew.. time to show high school french skills finally
5/31/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I knew it would be useful somewhere
5/31/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 10/10 would fail If i werent dutch 😂
5/31/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: You have to register before 14/6/2017
5/31/17, 18:13 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Are you sure? Because I think people can wait until after they get their resit grades in august to register
5/31/17, 18:13 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: That's what I saw on those screens in auditorium and I thought it was mentioned in the Q4 intro as well, but am going to check now
5/31/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It doesnt really matter But it has to be Done before Some date in order to get it after the vacation
5/31/17, 18:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok is it an exam or what ?
5/31/17, 18:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I didnt get it
5/31/17, 18:24 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's not an exam
5/31/17, 18:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its listed as exam... wtf is this tue fix your shit
5/31/17, 18:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also what happens if you dont get 60 etc in year 1 ???
5/31/17, 18:25 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's just called an exam 
They explained it twice during intro lectures
means they will check whether you have 60 points
If you applied and you won't have 60 it will be just waste of their time ( I consider )
5/31/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Dimi the BSA and Propedeuse requirements are listed clearly
5/31/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 45 points to continue
5/31/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 60 points for P
5/31/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you don't get 60 in first year you don't get the fancy P reward but it's not required for your bachelor
5/31/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: I don't get it anymore. Obviously TU/e grade of hidden information again. 
Found the SoftwareScience graduation dates and deadlines: https://educationguide.tue.nl/programs/bachelor-college/majors/software-science/graduation-deadlines/

The student administration site says:
https://educationguide.tue.nl/organization/student-administration/terminating-enrollment-upon-final-examination/registering-for-final-examination-session/
* Registering for final examination session*
Before the assessment of your final study activity, you will need to contact the Examination Committee of your program in order to minimize the time between completing your final study activity and being awarded your degree.

Register via Osiris for the next final examination session of your Examination Committee after the date on which you expect the result of your final study component to be announced. If the deadline for registering for that session has already passed, you should register for the final examination session immediately after that.

But then in the slides of intro Q4 R. Bloo has put that the certificate presentation for nominal students would be October 9th 2017. That ain't in that list. Either way, I cannot find the data I said earlier anywhere so I guess that was something else then?
5/31/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Rip, the bold did not work
5/31/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If Roel Bloo said October 9th then that should be it I think
5/31/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Mail him maybe?
5/31/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
5/31/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nothing
5/31/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 500 is an HTTP error code, this means their server is kaduuk
5/31/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Which honestly does not surprise me a lot anymore
5/31/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's a professional word for broken
5/31/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Okay then !
5/31/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: How to solve it: Wait, if that does not fix it, sacrifice two virgin goats in the pavilion while reciting the bible in PP2 assembly
5/31/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or just email the teacher, also possible
5/31/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Okay thank u 😂👍🏻
5/31/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: For DBL embedded systems, is your whole group supposed to attend the midterm presentation or only the people that are presenting?
5/31/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: yes
5/31/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Uhu

5/31/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I know
5/31/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Whole group is supposed to, however there are no real consequences If half of Them are there
5/31/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: As far as i know
5/31/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: IIRC not as well
5/31/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: As long as there is an actual presentation
5/31/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If they start to bakkus, just say that the train has problems
5/31/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: IAWR
5/31/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: @31621372984 has some experience in presenting without all members there if I'm correct
5/31/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, also, if you are struggling with coming up with an explanation why your machine works the way it should: Just say "Computers are very accurate, therefore our machine is accurate" - John, 2k17
5/31/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: "computers are accurate, so we dont need to focus on accuracy ourselves" - @John, 2017
5/31/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: LOL
5/31/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: @31631192870 lemme fix that tag for you Rick
5/31/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Sounds like a very good explanation
5/31/17, 23:42 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, for each year we have to re-enroll, did I get it right? 
And It's not available until 1st of June, yea?
5/31/17, 23:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for the people in SDC for USE: are we in paviljoen, or in matrix?

6/1/17, 08:39 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I still get the server error on Momotor 
I dont really mind not testing my turing machines there , but is it sufficient to just submit it on canvas ?
6/1/17, 08:40 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: momotor takes your submissions from canvas amd tests those
6/1/17, 08:41 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: so yes, it is sufficoent to submit to canvas :p
6/1/17, 08:41 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Great thank you :)
6/1/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: (though you need to give momotor permissiom to access your canvas details if youve not done that already. this is done via the mototor page when you load it for the forst time)
6/1/17, 08:49 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I hope the canvas help desk fix it for me

6/1/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Thanks Max & Max
6/1/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 👍🏽
6/1/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: How long should it take before your submitted assignments show up in the Momotor tab? I uploaded them just like normally via the assignment and they are named correctly I think (e.g. "A6.ctm"), but they have not shown up yet at all!
6/1/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: there should at least be a "processing" thingy
6/1/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: otherwise it failed
6/1/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Well that's annoying...
6/1/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I had to use chrome to see results the first time
6/1/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: After I could use waterfox
6/1/17, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Takes about 5min to process
6/1/17, 20:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Me the other way around
6/1/17, 20:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Seems legit
6/1/17, 20:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Just use explorer, its better ~ every person who has No clue Why Some browsers make it Work And others dont
6/1/17, 20:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not that i know Why But still 😂
6/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I'm still getting this server error on Momotor , i contacted the Canvas helpdesk but they did nothing so far.
I was wondering if I was submittting it in a wrong manner or sth 
I just submit it on Canvas  in the form Ax.ctm and that's it right ?
6/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Am I the only one who has this error ?
6/1/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ehm
6/1/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Id suggest mailing Erik de vink
6/1/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: He responds super fast
6/1/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And can make the student assistants n peeps fix it
6/1/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I did
6/1/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If its on their end
6/1/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: It was his suggestion to contact the helpdesk
6/1/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ah Then i dont know
6/1/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Juuuuust to be sure, you didn't submit it as Ax.ctm right? More like A1.ctm or A5.ctm? You never know 🙂
6/1/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: A5.ctm
6/1/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I did not make that mistake no 😅
6/1/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: What you could try is submitting one of the example codes they gav and see if it still gives the error
6/1/17, 21:48 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Same error
6/2/17, 07:10 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: VOOR DE STUDENTEN WAARVAN DE OUDERS NAAR DE OUDERDAGEN KOMEN: het is aan te raden ook een flesje water mee te nemen met dit weer
6/2/17, 07:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hahahahha thanks cpt obvious
6/2/17, 07:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: eigen lunchen voorzienen?
6/2/17, 07:11 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Als je hebt ingeschreven krijg je lunch
6/2/17, 07:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice
6/2/17, 07:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: kan je komen zonder inschrijving dan
6/2/17, 07:13 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Nee
6/2/17, 07:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nee dan weren ze je aan de TU/e ingang met wapens
6/2/17, 07:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Tuurlijk kan je komen
6/2/17, 07:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maar geen lunch of andere items voor jou dan
6/2/17, 07:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh
6/2/17, 07:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: rip
6/2/17, 07:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
6/2/17, 13:15 - Casper Smits: When designing a cTM for the assignments in the reader, the book talks about tau steps (e.g. tau[#/#,R] ), but I was wondering if we are allowed to use epsilon steps? (epsilon[#/#,R] ) to check whether the input letter is empty?
6/2/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: isn't that just a blank?
6/2/17, 13:19 - Casper Smits: Nevermind, I forgot the fact that cTM only accept if the input string is completely empty
6/2/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: cTM is different from a pushdown automata you know that?
6/2/17, 13:23 - Casper Smits: yes, I know. I'm talking about chapter 4, not the cTM (online) assignment
6/2/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: But why would you study chapter 4 if it isnt asked on the exam
6/2/17, 13:25 - Casper Smits: I want to make all exercises that are given on canvas
6/2/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
6/2/17, 13:26 - Casper Smits: I seek understanding, not just a good grade 😉
6/2/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then it makes sense
6/2/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Good luck!
6/2/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: This is a reactive Turing machine you're talking about. cTM's don't even have an input string, only an initial tape content.
6/2/17, 13:33 - Casper Smits: Yes, exactly. Excuse my ambiguity. I meant rTMs instead of cTMs
6/2/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Does anyone have B8
6/2/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Can someone explain what has to be done there
6/2/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Which one is B8?
6/2/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: When you have a input x*y then you only have to make sure that the last part of y is equal to x
6/2/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If so remove the string and place a 'Y' otherweise place a 'N'
6/2/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yes i do
6/2/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: what thomas said indeed
6/2/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: you have for instance abb*xxxxxxxabb
6/2/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: that one should be accepted
6/2/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: just make sure that the part in front of the star is the same as the last part right of the star
6/2/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and ur good
6/2/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then indeed replace the full string with Y
6/2/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and thats it
6/2/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Can you just make a loop for if it's a, a loop for if it's b, and a transition if it's *, * being that you actually found and compared the x to last part of y succesfully, and so you can return the Y for accepted
6/2/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ooh okay
6/2/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I understand
6/2/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Thanks
6/2/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I think it should work something like that, but you'd have to find out the specifica
6/2/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Specifics*
6/2/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
6/2/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Prolly not
6/2/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: I have the same probelm
6/2/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Needs to be Ax.ctm etc
6/2/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Or Bx or Cx
6/2/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Canvas does this automatically
6/2/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: ^
6/2/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh
6/2/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Not for me..
6/2/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: And after you submit them they should be visible on Momotor, right? Or do you have to do something for that as well
6/2/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Because it just says 'No result available' for me
6/2/17, 18:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I had to use chrome to get it to work though
6/2/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I'm using chrome
6/2/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I normally use waterfox
6/2/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And picking chrome did the trick for me
6/2/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: It works with A3-2.ctm
6/2/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: well, for me at least
6/2/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 57985842‬: For me also nothing is showing up in the momotor tab, just 'No result available'. I uploaded the files as Ax.ctm Bx.ctm and Cx.ctm where x is the exercise number. Not sure why it doesn't work.
6/2/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: It works even though canvas makes it A3-2 for example
6/2/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Or it's supoosed to at least, it worked for me
6/2/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Supposed*
6/2/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: yeah strange
6/2/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it doesnt work for me and @31622560797 either
6/2/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: 👆🏻
6/2/17, 19:03 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Then I guess you only had one shot
6/2/17, 19:03 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: One opportunity
6/2/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: It also didn't work the first time 
XD
6/2/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It does
6/2/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I have A/B/Cx-1.ctm And it worked fine
6/2/17, 23:38 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Can a pda have more than 1 accepting state ?
6/2/17, 23:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeh
6/2/17, 23:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Bur
6/2/17, 23:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You just use the same state right?
6/2/17, 23:54 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Use the same state ?
6/2/17, 23:55 - ‪+31 6 27426992‬: The sprint of the age
6/2/17, 23:55 - ‪+31 6 27426992‬: Never again fitness
6/2/17, 23:59 - ‪+31 6 38558225‬: Indeed
6/3/17, 01:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Since there is No getting out of the accepting state anymore (its accepted Or its not), there is No use in making 2 accepting states
6/3/17, 01:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You can much better merge them into 2 arrows (Or more) leasing to the same accepting state
6/3/17, 01:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Leading**
6/3/17, 01:39 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Alright thank u everyone
6/3/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: For the planning of electives, what did you guys choose besides the coherent packages and the Use package? There is so much to choose from...
6/3/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I chose Imperative Programming
6/3/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Which is 2IPH0
6/3/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But I got 2 coherent packages
6/3/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: Roel Bloo advised 2AS00 (some Statistics subject) or 2DBI00 (Some Linear Algebra subject) if you needed an elective in Q4
6/3/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I chose AI
6/3/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 2AS00 is a great subject, I am following it this quartile
6/3/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Didn't have the package but still wanted the course
6/3/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: they advise you to have chosen CG or some algebra subject for that tho
6/3/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Alright I'll take a look at those, thanks guys
6/3/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I'll ask Daniel to hit me up with what I need to know, he did it in q3 already
6/3/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I think you mean Q2
6/3/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: No he did AI in q3
6/3/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: for everyone who is gonna ask questions about the online quiz for USE i can guaranty the following answers are correct

6/3/17, 19:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: app development requires another course beforehand
6/3/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: which course?

6/3/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: When is the deadline fornplanaop
6/3/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: And why is it not fixed yet
6/3/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Oh that's just fucking perfect in't it?
6/3/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: deadline is 9th
6/3/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: well, you can use the term deadline loosely there
6/3/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Planapp only shows 0SAB0C for me, while I am registered for 0SAB0A....
6/3/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you should use the Osiris catalogue to see if there are any (recommended) prior courses for a subject
6/3/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: At the moment it feels like carving my electives into a stone plate causes is easier than using planapp

6/4/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: @31643222030 wants to do that one
6/4/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Idk if he got it working together

6/4/17, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that he said he "got it working"
6/4/17, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Thats not what im asking
6/4/17, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I know

6/4/17, 10:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because, you can't just ignore the fact that business information systems is only available in Q1 and create a custom course with the same name an plan it in Q3
6/4/17, 10:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thats not how it workd
6/4/17, 10:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31617878796
6/4/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Dear Peoples, I made a file list on cs-students where you can dump your electives planning, This will help a lot of us as most of us will choose similar packages https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/Electives+Planning+Examples
6/4/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: it is also taught in Q3 under a different subject code. Its' allowed
6/4/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: whats the subject code?
6/4/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: any idea?

6/4/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: 2IIC0 is the code of the subject in Q1
6/4/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that made my entire planning work
6/4/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: 👌🏻
6/4/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I got everything together
6/4/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For you it'd be even better
6/4/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Since you already have cg
6/4/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yah
6/4/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but my fucking use package is in the same timeslot as my courses
6/4/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so i need to pick another use package
6/4/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll send you mine
6/4/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: can tou put it on cs-students?
6/4/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Not before mondayevening

6/4/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: are there ANY use packages that are not all in timeslot A?
6/4/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it's fucking impossible to plan design for games and play AND plan a use package
6/4/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: they both have ALL of their courses in timeslot A
6/4/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is there a USE package that doesnt have a course in Q1?
6/4/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm gonna ask another question even though nobody is answering them

6/4/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Why does it say theres not enough credits in my Propedeuse?
6/4/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You need 12 subjects of creds
6/4/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: CG maybe?
6/4/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You failed a course so you could only have 11 subjects
6/4/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I didn't fail it
6/4/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I passed my resit
6/4/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Dont you need to select the 0SAB0C thingy?
6/4/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I've got 0SAB0A tho
6/4/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, but I needed it as well
6/4/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Do you have the 0sab0 ?
6/4/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so just.. plan 0SAB0A AND 0SAB0C?
6/4/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: While I had 0SAB0A already, yes
6/4/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
6/4/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: rip tho

6/4/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That shouldn't be a problem
6/4/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
6/4/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lets hope so
6/4/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: None of this should be a problem
6/4/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yet here we are
6/4/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: You can't just delete the bottom one? The topone is the only one that matters right ?
6/4/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Scroll a few messages up
6/4/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I added that one because planapp said I was lacking 0SAB2C
6/4/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 0SAB0C*
6/4/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh my bad, just say this picture
6/4/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: What a broken app lol

6/4/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah its BS
6/4/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yeah, but overlapping timeslots should be allowed because the TW&SfS program have some on default
6/4/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: does anyone already know how to do this?
6/4/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
6/4/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Seeing that I'm very scared suddenly

6/4/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: same
6/4/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It's basically the same as proving that the intersection of two regular languages is again  regular. You start with a PDA that accepts L1 and a DFA or NFA that accepts L2. You then turn that into an PDA that contains all combinations of (a state from the PDA) and (a state from the NFA)
6/4/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Then the final states are those where the PDA and NFA both accept
6/4/17, 13:25 - Bas Gieling: is there a place on cs-students to upload your USE online test answers?
6/4/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh yea shit
6/4/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: use test

6/4/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: And I'd say that it's c, because with kantian deontology you'd think about the rule 'do commit plagiarism'
6/4/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Instead of not having any rule about it
6/4/17, 15:16 - ‪+351 935 579 164‬: it's definitely not b, so it might be c

6/4/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We looked them up in the book
6/4/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and it made more sense
6/4/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: okay

6/4/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I believe that the book told that you become virtuous by doing virtuous things
6/4/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: So then I'd say that c is the closest thing to that, but I'm not sure

6/4/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But it is nice of course it it is hosted

6/4/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Could I use an introductory subject from a USE package as a single elective? Need an elective for quartile 1 that is not timeslot C or E
6/4/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: Design for Games and Play I is introductory and is in timeslot A
6/4/17, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I'll take a look

6/4/17, 18:54 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: isnt y->y'
6/4/17, 18:54 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: oh I missed that one
6/4/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: well then it should also be x^y' right?
6/4/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: eric, you not taking IIS?
6/4/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because with IIS I cannot for the life of me fit Design for Games and play in
6/4/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because DBL IIS is in timeslot A, and so is USE AND Design for games and play 1
6/4/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: nope, as they recommend CG for that which I haven't taken
6/4/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: all in Q/
6/4/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 1
6/4/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright i see
6/4/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: combo IIS and Design for Games and Play is impossible then
6/4/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: you watn to get to x^y to be able to use the IH
6/4/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: so that's why they don't use the reproduction rule there yet I guess
6/4/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: we use it on x
6/4/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: unless you take an extra year, then yes
6/4/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice

6/4/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Does anyone know this one?
6/4/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: a
6/4/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: mean d
6/4/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: sorry its d
6/4/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ty!
6/4/17, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Does anyone know of a use line that does not have a subject in quartile 2?
6/4/17, 23:39 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I don't think there are any
6/4/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 🙃🔫
6/4/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes, there is one afaik!
6/4/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sec!
6/4/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wait, nvm
6/4/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: There isn't
6/4/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Which packages do you wanna combine?
6/4/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you almost made me not paint a swastika on the side of vertigo
6/4/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: security and web dev
6/4/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm, then idk
6/4/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Move dbl algorithms to quartile 4
6/4/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Then it is possible
6/4/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: did that already
6/4/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and no then it is still not possible
6/4/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I have it, so I think it is
6/4/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: how??
6/4/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: did you not do the introduction to cryptography?
6/4/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I do that in year 3
6/4/17, 23:43 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Use package and the course for web development in year 2
6/4/17, 23:43 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: would you mind sending me a screenshot of your planning? I cannot figure it out
6/4/17, 23:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: so when do you do web analytics?
6/4/17, 23:44 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Sure, gimme a minute
6/4/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: <Media omitted>
6/4/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Wait a minute, I might be mistaken - I thought web development was the same as app development
6/4/17, 23:47 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Still, this way I can fit three electives in quartile 2 spread over year 2 and 3
6/4/17, 23:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yeh, the problem is that the web package needs the course web analitics
6/4/17, 23:48 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and that's also in quartile 2
6/4/17, 23:49 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Do you also need web technology?
6/4/17, 23:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yeh, that's my second package :)
6/4/17, 23:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: together with securityu
6/4/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ahh so you need 4 electives in quartile 2 :P
6/4/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yup
6/4/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: yeah I think that is not gonna work without one extra year or 4 subjects in 1 quartile, sorry man
6/4/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: :/
6/4/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: well
6/4/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I reckon I'll just do app dev instead
6/4/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: only one more subject
6/4/17, 23:51 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 4 subjects is possible, if you do it in year 2 and you fail one you have a 2nd chance in year 3
6/5/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Security and computational has the same problem even when using the only non retardedly planned use package
6/5/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Afaik
6/5/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/5/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: just like any other assignment
6/5/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it says " submission via momotor"
6/5/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So I expected it to be not just like any other assignment
6/5/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes
6/5/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: well, when they said deadline for choosing electives is in may I expected the planapp to work, yet here we are
6/5/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
6/5/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Same\
6/5/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but no, you just submit them in the assignment section
6/5/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/5/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Gotta give even the best thing in the world called canvas a bit of time Daan
6/5/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahaha
6/5/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "the successor of Peach" --> "we made it even worse"
6/5/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What are the tasks of the server that processes our assignments btw? It shouldn't take much more power than our Java programs from Q1 right? Those executed instantly
6/5/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Nobody knows... Even in the results I think it says the execution time for one test is like 0.2 seconds
6/5/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would help us out quite a bit to give feedback in seconds because then you can change errors
6/5/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: They dont want us to improve so we will be here again next year and pay more tuition
6/5/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: that makes sense sadly ;p
6/5/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/5/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: <Media omitted>
6/5/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: I think msi
6/5/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Idk how much you like compiling shit, otherwise I'd choose the .msi :P
6/5/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Guys does the amount of transitions for the cTM's matter if it works?
6/5/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I noticed one of mine wasn't working for all inputs so I fixed it but the amount of transitions is now 10x as high 😋
6/5/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: You are graded based on your technique
6/5/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Not just on efficiency
6/5/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I have sometimes 1000 transitions on like 10 input things lol
6/5/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: But dont take Sander as an example 😘
6/5/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 😂 love you too bro
6/5/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Well I was just trying out long strings of input, and with 30 ish I ended up with 20000+ instead of 2000+ like before

6/5/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Loool
6/5/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I hope your states are numbered randomly
6/5/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And not in order
6/5/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Not randomly but also not in order xD
6/5/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: "q779"?
6/5/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I used q777 when you get 'lucky' with the input and it should accept
6/5/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: q778 and 779 are follow up
6/5/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Also used q666 when you are doomed and it should not accept
6/5/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Lol Nice
6/5/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: <Media omitted>
6/5/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Leading zero's? Like empty string? Or also wrong input
6/5/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: A2
6/5/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Ik not sure what you mean. But the input can start with zeroes, like '0001011' is allowed. But for your output you can't give '001011', it would have to be '1011'
6/5/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Ah got it thanks
6/5/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Someone here who already did c3?
6/5/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Or a5 for that matter 😂
6/5/17, 14:04 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: i had A5, need help ?
6/5/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Ehm im first trying to finish c3 atm, but will contact you later for sure haha
6/5/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: The course 2IPE0 is plannend for Y3Q1, but it is your final project right? So even though it is planned there, you can work on it the entire year and it thus would not be a problem to plan a fourth course for Y3Q1?
6/5/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 2IPE0, if it is the SEP/BEP, should be planned in Y3Q4
6/5/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It should be taken either in Y3Q4 or Y4Q1
6/5/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Ah okay! That makes more sense.
6/5/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: keep in mind though that if you do a 4th year only for one subject in the 1st quartile, you'd have to wait the rest of the year before you could do a master's degree
6/5/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Some masters start in februari right?
6/5/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think that there are situations in which you're allowed to start a masters while completing the last 1 or 2 courses from your bachelor
6/5/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But ik not sure how that works
6/5/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Has anyone here combined security and computational science?
6/5/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: not sure
6/5/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: there are a couple of example planning on cs-students
6/5/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: When do you have algebra for security Jort?
6/5/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I'm planning for first quartile year 2
6/5/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: q1 next year
6/5/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: so same
6/5/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I just wanna get it over with
6/5/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Me2, but I now have 4 courses that quartile
6/5/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Are DBL algorithms/discrete structures needed as prerequisites for some things, I'd like to move em around but i don't know how much i'd fuck up
6/5/17, 16:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys what elective packages ( use and coherent ) that you choose and what is moderately easy. Just want some side opinions
6/5/17, 16:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I mean something that is not too advanced
6/5/17, 16:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Like security sounds interesting but quite grinding to do
6/5/17, 16:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I was looking at app dev but i am not sure about it and i also need some advice
6/5/17, 16:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😊thanks in advance
6/5/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: If you want easy packages look at app dev and web technology
6/5/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Why not so sure about appdev?
6/5/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: then fill the rest with subjects from industrial design or psychology and technology
6/5/17, 16:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Jort i am not that lazy 😂
6/5/17, 16:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thanks tho
6/5/17, 16:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Storm i am really interested in app dev but i dont know about others
6/5/17, 16:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Dont we have to choose 2 coherent and 1 yse
6/5/17, 16:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Use
6/5/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Appdev would suffice for 1 package
6/5/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Not too hard but also not a walk in the park
6/5/17, 16:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I also saw computer science essentials which we already have 4 / 5 dubjects in the program
6/5/17, 16:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Does that count or is it not considered elective
6/5/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Not counted
6/5/17, 16:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thought so
6/5/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Subjects we already have don't count towards the 15 points we need for said package
6/5/17, 16:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: We had this year or subjects we have mandatory in the program
6/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Mandatory
6/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oki thanks
6/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: O anyway besides app dev which sounds very appealing
6/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Web technology, if you have HTI this quartile that's already 1/3 courses done
6/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Is that coherent or use
6/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: coherent
6/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sounds like use
6/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Coherent
6/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh rly
6/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: if you've done computer graphics, you also have done 1/3 of a package, but what was the name of that package again?
6/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Naaah ma man thats not for me
6/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😂
6/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh so web technology looks alright
6/5/17, 16:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What about use packages
6/5/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Interactive intelligent systems
6/5/17, 16:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I looked at technology enterpreneurshit  and new product developement and marketig
6/5/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Robotics if you want a somewhat fun package, design thinking if you want a better fit in the schedule
6/5/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: All use packages except design thinking are in the same quartiles which really fucks most packages over
6/5/17, 16:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah
6/5/17, 16:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Tech enterpreneurshit  fits good but its fucks one of your timeslots 😂
6/5/17, 16:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Gg tue give ys 100 electives to choose from but all of them are in the same slot 🤷🏻‍♂
6/5/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yes I don't know wth is wrong with all those electives
6/5/17, 16:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Taking 3 subjects per quartile rly doesnt leave much optio s to be abke to normaly finish in 3 years 😅
6/5/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Its doable, if you shift a bit
6/5/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Pardon if i was calling someone, something went wrong somewhere
6/5/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Jep you called me 😱
6/6/17, 08:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Anyone planning to go to the USE lecture today?
6/6/17, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nope
6/6/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: I think we can count em on one jand
6/6/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: that's optimistic
6/6/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Does anyone here know how many level 3 electives you need for a double major sfs/wbs?
6/6/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
6/6/17, 10:09 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Standard binary
6/6/17, 10:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You convert from 2s complement to normal binary
6/6/17, 10:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But normal binary has no negative values
6/6/17, 10:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: And 2s complement has
6/6/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: So you have to put a - in front of your binary number if the original 2s complement number was negative​
6/6/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: First you do binary addition/subtraction(idk what anymore
6/6/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: )
6/6/17, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: U what now, Rick
6/6/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, I am looking it up atm
6/6/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay
6/6/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I looked it up
6/6/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So your algorithm is:
6/6/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You take your number
6/6/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Subtract one
6/6/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If the first number is a 1, add a - in front of it
6/6/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then you invert the entire number
6/6/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And remove any leading zeroes
6/6/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So from the minus sign onwards, you just do 0/-,R
6/6/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh okay thanks!
6/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Then you get a sequence of minuses?
6/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, and remove all but the first one
6/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Its just a rough outline :P
6/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Last one
6/6/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: whats the difference between the Information security in society and the Security package?
6/6/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Information security in society is less mathematical and more writing papers
6/6/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Information science in security focuses more on laws and regulations regarding security
6/6/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so if we have our major program, we need to pick at least 4 level 3 subjects, is that correct?
6/6/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is the planapp deadline still up? since it doesnt even work yet
6/6/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: please? :(
6/6/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Zeg 'k lekker nie
6/6/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: it says the main program consist of 7 level 3 subjects but i count them and only come to 5
6/6/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
6/6/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
6/6/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: What does it say in Osiris?
6/6/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Weird, you should send an email to CG about it I guess
6/6/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a14Y2V5zJlY
6/6/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: where can I find the mail address for these people?
6/6/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Maybe press validate, the it sometimes updates the Osiris information
6/6/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Then*
6/6/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: who should I email in general about questions like this? studycounselor?
6/6/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Probably, if he doesn't know he will redirect you
6/6/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so we cant validate our plan if we have HTI since it either says you have an overlap with USE C (even though I have USE A) or when you take USE A it says i dont have enough abchelor subjects in year
6/6/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 1
6/6/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Just don't validate it I guess
6/6/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: as long as you know it is correct, it should be fine
6/6/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
6/6/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Pressing the validate button = getting errors, but also updates on your registrations
6/6/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: says this for me too
6/6/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: even though i passed too
6/6/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: just ignore it
6/6/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I mailed some people about it, I'm just gonne ignore it for now then
6/6/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: The same thing is happening for me for Artificial Intelligence
6/6/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It's probably not a big deal
6/6/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: "just did something about it, gonna ignore it" -Joost
6/6/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: just hope not
6/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I mailed people, but they probably won't respond soon enough to answer my problems, or even fix them, which is why I'm going ahead and just ignore the problem for now and come back to it when it is actually fixed
6/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: better?
6/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: 😊
6/6/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Anyone who can help me with B6 for the cTM? I thought i had it but now it doesn't work and i have no idea how to do it from here
6/6/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Like not an answer but just a hint or something would be Nice
6/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: I can have a look at it, finished mine already
6/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys, in the security package theres a course - 2AC20 - which has recommended prior knowledge of 2AC10, which is not in the package
6/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what so I do?
6/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Thanks would be nice😅
6/6/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I'm completely stuck :/
6/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: so only a hint would already help me out tremendously, I have no idea where to start haha
6/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You can do it without 2AC10, I did so this year
6/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright thanks anne
6/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: did you miss anything though?
6/6/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because im not you
6/6/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: How would you do it if there was only a string of one letter on the left side? For example 'a'?
6/6/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Well, you had to write something called a roadmap that included some very vague parts like risk analysis, but with the help of stuff I got from another student who took 2AC10 and answers I got on my questions to the lecturer it was doable
6/6/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: i would check for any a on the right side, but how do you do this if you have no information on the length of the string on the left side
6/6/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hmmmmmm
6/6/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not sure yet
6/6/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: Well, you need to find out if left is a substring of right, so go on until you reach * on the left, or # on the right
6/6/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: But you cant check multiple symbols at once right?
6/6/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: i'm so confused :')
6/6/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: Nope, just start at the first symbol and work your way towards the end
6/6/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
6/6/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: What do the x and v stand for?
6/6/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You only have to write reports, no tests, that is quite easy. I didn't like it that much, but you might learn a lot about practical stuff, through the 2 hours of lectures per week or self study.

Further, if you take Computer networks and security and Introduction to cryptology, those probably cover most of 2AC10, apart from the roadmap part, but it isn't that difficult to look up unknown subjects in the book or google or something.
6/6/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I used the x as an indicator of which symbol was checked last to make sure it is in the right order
6/6/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: And then v for a symbol that was checked before that but since I have to start from the 1 after x i replaced the other checked ones by v
6/6/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Might be total nonsense but that's what I came up with 😂
6/6/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: Well, the first mistake that you make is when looking at the first symbols is that you don't skip past the rest of the string on the left side. For example: when checking 'abc' you change it to '#bc' but then you're not at the right side, so skip past the rest of the symbols
6/6/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: The way you make your thingie isn't how they want it: don't put R or L in the states, this is the way we had to do it with fundamentals, but not here
6/6/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I did do that actually because I say after removing the first symbol: move right until a * is found and then I move on
6/6/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah I know I did it the other way in the ctm.jar file but did this just for convenience haha
6/6/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: yeah, but it makes it way harder to change it to the way they want it, since you need to add more states for that probably
6/6/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: Like, if you want to check the first symbol after the *, then you need an extra state for that in your turing machine
6/6/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah that's true indeed
6/6/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: But about the assignment it self do you have a clue how to do it because I tried this in the jar file but it didn't work
6/6/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: Oh, after you went to the right side, you don't start from the x. So if you have axabc on the right and are looking for an a, then you get the first one and not the second one.
6/6/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: The way you want to do it is right, but you have small mistakes like this one
6/6/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: No actually that does work haha I tested it in the jar file the only thing that is a problem I don't know how to fix is that when it checks for example: ab*aab 
It declines it because it takes the first a and then the second symbol is no b so it says it's not a substring but I don't know how to get it to check again starting with the other a
6/6/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: oh, then I have no idea since it I just tested it with mine and apparently that doesn't work either....:$
6/6/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ohh well then I'll just try to figure out something hahah
6/6/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Still thanks for helping s
6/6/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: btw thanks for giving me a heart attack since I thought I finished this stupid thing
6/6/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Hahaha no problem
6/6/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: If you do figure it out please let me know 😅
6/6/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: and me ^^'
6/6/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: is "2IC80 Lab on offensive computer security" the missing project of the security package?
6/6/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yes
6/6/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Insert in manually
6/6/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You don't have to
6/6/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: it's in the package in osiris now^^
6/6/17, 22:41 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: How do we submit our study plan ?
6/6/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Concept -> overwrite
6/6/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Okay thank u
6/6/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Should that grey out the "submit for approval" button?
6/6/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: What is that button?
6/6/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
6/6/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: This
6/6/17, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 30686090‬: Seems like they changed website a bit. I didn't see it last week
6/6/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: No idea what to do with that
6/6/17, 23:44 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can someone tell me what exactly a "clear and unambiguous judgement" is?
6/6/17, 23:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Do you have some context for that?
6/6/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ● Indicate what could go wrong if the main actor(s) in your case study lack(s) relevant virtues
● Evaluate whether this is a clear, unambiguous judgment.
6/6/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for USE
6/6/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: study guide B, Virtue Ethics
6/6/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, what part do you not understand?
6/6/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: what exactly I'm meant to evaluate, or when something a clear unambiguous judgement is
6/6/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Clear means not influenced by anything, unambiguous is that you exactly know what they mean

6/7/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Please unenroll for sfs and register for something where you are allowed to take pictures like this
6/7/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: how are we expected to read any of this
6/7/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Lol
6/7/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Second
6/7/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: why is it even tilted like this aint no snapchat
6/7/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ahahhahahaha
6/7/17, 00:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: make a screenshot like everyone else

6/7/17, 00:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: thank god
6/7/17, 00:23 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Is this how one puts security into ones Plan
6/7/17, 00:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I dont know anything about the security package im sorry
6/7/17, 00:24 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: do you know anything at all
6/7/17, 00:25 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: no cryptology is after algebra
6/7/17, 00:25 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: So 2WF80 in year 3 ?
6/7/17, 00:27 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: yes
6/7/17, 00:28 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: And 2WF70 and 2WF90, are they supposed to be in the same quartile, or is one for year 2 and one for year 3
6/7/17, 00:28 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You only need 2WF90
6/7/17, 00:29 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Alright nice
6/7/17, 00:30 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: And do you know something about the 2IC70, legal and technical aspects of ISY
6/7/17, 00:30 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: IST
6/7/17, 00:40 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Doesn't exist anymore
6/7/17, 00:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Replaced by 2AC20
6/7/17, 00:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: But you only need 3 subjects for the package to count, so you can also do 2IC80
6/7/17, 00:51 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: So you cant do 2ic80 and 2ac20 together
6/7/17, 00:51 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: you need to choose one of the two ?
6/7/17, 01:05 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You can do both if you want to
6/7/17, 01:07 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: It causes timeslot issues
6/7/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Anyone got a clue about what to do at B3?
6/7/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
6/7/17, 11:19 - Kevin Jilissen: The three words separated by a * should be its own reverse
6/7/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ahh, now it makes sense :P
6/7/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Thanks!

6/7/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Does anyone have a hint?
6/7/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Use google
6/7/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And not meant to be a bitch, but in this case it helps you a lot.
6/7/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh really :p
6/7/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm gonna take a look
6/7/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks
6/7/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Another hint: What you are trying to do is unary division
6/7/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Division works
6/7/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just the modulus
6/7/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, your basic algorithm is
6/7/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Keep subtracting until the amount of ones on the left side is smaller than or equal to the amount of ones on the right side
6/7/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And when that then happens, subtract the ones on the right side from your left side
6/7/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And thats your modulus
6/7/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah that I get, but at the point where there is one 1 remaining at the left while there are two on the right, should I just go back to the remaining 1 (which I made a 2 to check it)  and set is back to 1? And delete everything right of it
6/7/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then I have div and mod seperated by a *
6/7/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Although I have no clue whether it'll work with longer inputs
6/7/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm, in that case I wouldn't know
6/7/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Isn't it the case that you did one subtraction iteration too many then?
6/7/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Subtracting is what I'm doing by setting 1's to zeroes for every 1 on the right sidw
6/7/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: I personally did A4 by placing the * to the left of the numerator, and then starting the division on the right side of the numerator, adding the result before the *. 
If you then end up not having enough numerator left to remove the denominator, that remainder is the modulo.
6/7/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Thanks Whatsapp. Imagine a * before and after the bold section.
6/7/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fuck you hero! I was doing it way too difficult
6/7/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: After my succesful division I made everything 1's again for modulo even though all my 2's were the modulo result haha
6/7/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Do note that you may have to place an extra symbol behind the denominator, because this method leaves a large blank hole in the middle between numerator and denominator.
6/7/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Makes it hard to find the denominator, so you can compensate with an extra symbol to mark the end.
6/7/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What do you mean?
6/7/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You can make the answer tidy right? Just moving everything to the compact version of div * mod
6/7/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: The specific way I did it, I removed the 1's of the numerator after every subtraction.
6/7/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: So it goes like this:
*11111#11
1*111###11
This leaves a big blank hole, which I had to compensate for.
6/7/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah I do the same instead I make the 1 a 2 instead of a # when subtracting
6/7/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: That works.
6/7/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But what do you do at the point where you check the last 1 on the numerator with the first 1 of the denominator? Then you are left with just the last 1 of the denominator in your case
6/7/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But to know that it is the last 1 (so the mod answer) you would need to compare it to the other side
6/7/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But that would mean checking it again like you did with the others
6/7/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: During the division, I do mark off the 1's in the numerator without deleting them. If I run out of 1's in the numerator, I unmark them.
If the subtraction does work, I delete the marked ones on the way back to the denominator.
6/7/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ooh smart
6/7/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Gonna work with that
6/7/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks!
6/7/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: No problem.
6/7/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31650889435 , should the pointer be on a specific point of the tape at the end?
6/7/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Eh, I heard people say that it has to be on the first (leftmost) symbol of the output to be properly evaluated by Momotor, and I believe it's also convention to end on the first symbol, so I had it stop there.
6/7/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: But that takes two states at most.
6/7/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yep!
6/7/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thank you
6/7/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I hope momotor isn't gonna buttfuck me when I make the text file for this haha
6/7/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Of course it will.
6/7/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
6/7/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it had to be on the left of the first symbol
6/7/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: first = leftmost
6/7/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not on it
6/7/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31610720282  must the tape head be ON  or to the LEFT of the leftmost symbol?
6/7/17, 12:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: On the leftmost 
You can download examples they posted it was so there
6/7/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: On
6/7/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay, and what if I handed in B8 without taking that into account and momotor doesn't give an error?
6/7/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Left of it was wrong according to momotor
6/7/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Ehr
6/7/17, 12:22 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well it's a standard and guess we should stick to it
6/7/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Have you tried it?
6/7/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I also thought it should be ON
6/7/17, 12:22 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Won't make much more work adding one more state right?
6/7/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nono I will fix it if it should be like that, but was just wondering why it works now
6/7/17, 12:24 - Luke Houben: Maybe momotor accepts both because it skips the first blanks until it encounters something else
6/7/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/7/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: should I add one more state to make it move to the Y?
6/7/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yes
6/7/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: mine gave an error when it was ON the leftmost one
6/7/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it had to be left of the output
6/7/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Maybe motor accepts the symbols on the tape that doesn't mean that the tapehead is correct and the tutors also will check it
6/7/17, 12:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well when changes something to Y 
Just use S (stay)
6/7/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: ? Never had that @31621372984
6/7/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You can't use S
6/7/17, 12:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It will stay on the tape you changed
6/7/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wait what.. Can we use Stay?
6/7/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: No
6/7/17, 12:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Why can't?
6/7/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wth haha, I had no idea that existed in turing machines
6/7/17, 12:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I did use was no problem
6/7/17, 12:28 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Wouldn't make sense not having S
6/7/17, 12:35 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I just remember that we had this in fundamentals 
Used it in code and it worked
6/7/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm but it says nowhere to use that in the assignment or the course
6/7/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In my experience teachers don't like changes they didn't announce themselves
6/7/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They're a bit old fashioned
6/7/17, 12:36 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: We'll have they said you can use only left, right?
6/7/17, 12:36 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well*
6/7/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: not ONLY, but they said you could use those
6/7/17, 12:48 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: True, anyway I've send a message to Roel Bloo asking whther we can use S as well
6/7/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks for doing that!
6/7/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Curious to the answer
6/7/17, 12:49 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yea I hope for yes otherwise I have to rewrite some of mine haha
6/7/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I asked Vinke a while ago and he stated you cannot use am S motion
6/7/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Anyone that can help me to get started with A3?
6/7/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: If you could use S, surely he would have said that in the lecture at some point
6/7/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For A4, should it be able to process inputs that have a bigger denominator than numerator?
6/7/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because mine does not yet haha
6/7/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Mine does
6/7/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: is A4 the unary divison thing? if yes, then yes
6/7/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: How many times can you hand in your .ctm files for automota?
6/7/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Like, if something is wrong or something
6/7/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Once, or just as many times as you want?
6/7/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: i already submitted thrice
6/7/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: no problems here
6/7/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah alright thanks :)
6/7/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hw long before it gives a result ? xD
6/7/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: depends, wasn't really regular for me, once it was 20 seconds later it was 10 mins haha
6/7/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah alright thanks
6/7/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Which groups already have their design grade for HTI?
6/7/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Im curious how far he is with grading work
6/7/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: we got ours
6/7/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: group 10
6/7/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: we got ours, group 7
6/7/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Group 69 does not
6/7/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 56 neither yet he goes 1 to 73
6/7/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fuck haha
6/7/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: So if my TM ends this way, would that be okay?
6/7/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: <Media omitted>
6/7/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: <Media omitted>
6/7/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Yeah, I did not fully understand it
6/7/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: does anyone happen to have made a photo of the lemmas and theorems you need to be able to reproduce on the exam?
6/7/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: the slides arent up yet
6/7/17, 15:08 - Kevin Jilissen: <Media omitted>
6/7/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: thanks!
6/7/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: It should be on Y
6/7/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Or at least that's correct to
6/7/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: "From the symbol at the tapehead" so in your answer the blank is also in your solution
6/7/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I dont know if that's a problem
6/7/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Hmmm
6/7/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Do we have to consider retard inputs ? Like, inputs that could be trivially wrong?
6/7/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But that might fuck up the program or something
6/7/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't think so, because then you'd need to include loops for infinitely many symbols
6/7/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I would consider blank input though
6/7/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good point
6/7/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah alright thanks !
6/7/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: What is the notation for the simulator when you want your turing machine to move right on all inputs until it sees a blank?
6/7/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah, what the exercise says 'takes an input w in {a, b}*' you can assume that you'll only see a's and b's in your input,
6/7/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: q0 a/a,R q0 | repeat for all symbols, like b/b, c/c, etc
6/7/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: ah really? there is no shortcut?
6/7/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: not as far as I know
6/7/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: then the program will get huge 😂
6/7/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: i will need around 250 lines then...
6/7/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yes they can become quite big because of that
6/7/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: okay then ill do that, thank you
6/7/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: 250 lines :O?
6/7/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Mine are way smaller
6/7/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i closed everything without saving i want to kill myself
6/7/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, mine are smaller too, but that depends on the assignments
6/7/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: there is no way to get it back right 😫😫😫😫
6/7/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Omfg
6/7/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Maybe there is?
6/7/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I've got 2x 50 lines and one of about 100
6/7/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah similar indeed
6/7/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: i finished it with 181
6/7/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Not counting comment lines obv
6/7/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: but i did it the easy way, you can defenitly make it smaller 😂
6/7/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i got like 250 lines on my B assignment
6/7/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: less on A and C
6/7/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: same
6/7/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: though my C assignment always runs a lot of transitions
6/7/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: My B has quite alot of transitions too, but I dont think that matters too much
6/7/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: don't think so
6/7/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: They both got like 'accepted' on momotor so
6/7/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: they just check if it works right, not how efficient it is?
6/7/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Never went over 110 lines lol
6/7/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Efficiency is graded I believe
6/7/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And 12 states max
6/7/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: well, they are efficient for larger strings, just not extremely efficient for smaller ones
6/7/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: nice rubain machine
6/7/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is it?
6/7/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ye it is max
6/7/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It is
6/7/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because my assignments are not very efficient lol
6/7/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: expecially B
6/7/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But it doesn't count to heavily I believe
6/7/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: If I knew that before, I wouldn't have made a machine with 37 states... 😂
6/7/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 60% is checking if it works
6/7/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: jeez
6/7/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i have one with 43 states lol
6/7/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i just made it efficient because it would be onoverzichtelijk as fuck if it wasnt
6/7/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: _"Furthermore, the programs are inspected on sufficient and adequate comment. We will use three categories: insufficient, good, very good. This counts for 20%."_
6/7/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I have a small amount of states, but the strings can take a lot of transitions, is that efficient or not?
6/7/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So there's 20% left
6/7/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For efficiency
6/7/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: _Finally, the quality of the solutions are assessed regarding transparency and structure, elegance, efficiency of the underlying algorithm (rather than efficiency in terms of the minimal number of transitions w.r.t. the length of the input), etc._

6/7/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Doesn't seem like I can even submit anything
6/7/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Also not at 'Assignments' ?
6/7/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Because you have to hand it in there, and then it will show up at momotor
6/7/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Ah I didn't get that
6/7/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I will try

6/7/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Was a rethorical question
6/7/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fuck off 😛
6/7/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: okay, I need 3 subjects still for my plan, but don't know what to chose, any interesting subjects/packages I can take? I already have the coherent packages Web Technology, Interactive Intelligent Systems; and USE: Robots Everywhere
6/7/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: jan peter balkenende succeeded Wim Kok
6/7/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: DBL Information systems?
6/7/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: im taking that in Y3 Q4
6/7/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can you just take that as a sepperate course?
6/7/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Their upto group 21 now for the HTI design assignment
6/7/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: where can I find the results?
6/7/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: canvas grades
6/7/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ty
6/7/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i did at least joost
6/7/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: anyone knows if there is a nice USE package that is not in timeslot A?
6/7/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Currently fighting with cTM C1
6/7/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm getting exception on exception and so forth
6/7/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is that norma
6/7/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: normal*
6/7/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: while drawing the machine
6/7/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: no
6/7/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hmm
6/7/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: nope
6/7/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then my approach is not good
6/7/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I've already got C1 figured out if you need some help
6/7/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What I intended to do is have three main stages (for a, b and c) and for each of those check whether they are correct, and if there's a wrong letter replace that with the correct one, so if there's a c in my a sequence I place an a there and then enter a sideloop where I set the next a to become c
6/7/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But it gets messy real quick
6/7/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: theyre all in A rifht
6/7/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i think slot A is the use slot
6/7/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
6/7/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: especially the top one, of not having enough points(even though I have 12 subjects aka 60 points)
6/7/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: negeer maar gewoon
6/7/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is n bekende bug
6/7/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hoe heb je cg behaald gekregen in de planapp?
6/7/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ik had eerst niet een eigen concept gemaakt, was ik vergeten te doen
6/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: dus toen ik een nieuwe heb gemaakt moest ik CG er weer in zetten
6/7/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: en toen stond er ineens dat ie gehaald was
6/7/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: sjiet werkt bij mij niet
6/7/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ik had ook een mailtje er over gestuurd naar de vakdocent, en naar de studycounselor, misschien dat die er iets voor mij heeft gedaan
6/7/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: en dat het daarom nu wel er uitziet dat ik hem haalde
6/7/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: anders zou ik het ook niet weten
6/7/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Which USE packages are worth taking a look at?
6/7/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Robots Everywhere 👌🏽
6/7/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: robot's everywhere is okay
6/7/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: max, did you take the game design and play package?
6/7/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I wanted it, but didn't find a way to put it into my plan with Web Technology, IIS and RE
6/7/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nah man
6/7/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm unable to take it, since DfG&P I is in timeslot A in Q1, and DBL IIS is in A Q1 as well and I couldnt find a use package which didnt have a course in AQ1
6/7/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so that would mean i'd have to take 3 courses in the same timeslot in 2 quartiles
6/7/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: (Y2Q1 and Y3Q1)
6/7/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so... its impossible if you dont want two courses in the same timeslot
6/7/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so im gonna do IIS and security
6/7/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, that was exactly my problem too
6/7/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so sad about that
6/7/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: same dude
6/7/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: same
6/7/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: wish that course actually offered more timeslots
6/7/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i tried so hard
6/7/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: or was in different ones
6/7/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I feel ya
6/7/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I wish that there was USE courses in timeslots other than A
6/7/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: USE is fucking us over once again
6/7/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yup
6/7/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: why do we need USE again?
6/7/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because people like Katleen and Ruth need jobs
6/7/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's a social setting
6/7/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Like the retarded people that work at small shops so that the owners get money from the government
6/7/17, 18:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
6/7/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ohhh they're those kinds of people
6/7/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The lectures are starting to make sense now
6/7/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: saving my concept/plan then Draft > Overwrite Plan, that should be enough to have your plan be looked at for june 9th right? As I still cant press validate plan without getting errors
6/7/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and therefore I also can't press Submit for Approval either
6/7/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: also, who should I email if I have some issues with the PlanApp again?
6/7/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I bet Roel Bloo has not heard it before
6/7/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We should send him 10 emails
6/7/17, 19:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think the helpdesk?
6/7/17, 19:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Roel Bloo isn't the one regulating the planapp
6/7/17, 19:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it's not his responsibility
6/7/17, 19:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Max that was a joke
6/7/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Roel gets all the complaints every time 😛
6/7/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I am aware, joost may not be
6/7/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Just trying to make sure you do not confuse people too much, Roel has heard enough from us
6/7/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: And he always gives the same reply
6/7/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: FOntyyyyys
6/7/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that's not really what i meant, but sure
6/7/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No @31624553225 , I think the osiris helpdesk email is your solution
6/7/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: So is design for games and play in Utrecht or was that something else?
6/7/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: that in utrecht was something different
6/7/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: DGP is on the TUE
6/7/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: What are your opinions on DGP? I am a little worried it might be too 'easy'
6/7/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: the one in utrecht is called Game Design, and only features 2 subejcts, each 7.5 worth of points
6/7/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: it seems interesting
6/7/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and I've heard it can also be decently challenging
6/7/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I don't know what to compare it to, so I can't really tell how good/bad it is
6/7/17, 19:22 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Tried that, they sent my questions to the 'Back Office', haven't heard anything about it since
6/7/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so... who should I mail then
6/7/17, 20:04 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: <Media omitted>
6/7/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: move dbl algorithms to quartile 4
6/7/17, 20:06 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: ok that made it better thx
6/7/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Wait
6/7/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 2IC80 has been added
6/7/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: WOw
6/7/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: THey're doing actual work
6/7/17, 20:08 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: yes, but the app is still horrible to work with
6/7/17, 20:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How far are Paul and Natasha in grading HTI?
6/7/17, 20:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: group 50+ got their grades yet?
6/7/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: no
6/7/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 65 didnt
6/7/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: at least
6/7/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 21917788‬: Im in group 52 and didnt get my grade yet
6/7/17, 20:20 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: Wait we are at 50
I'm like group 26 and didn't get my grade🙄
6/7/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Then they must've stopped lol
6/7/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm in 21
6/7/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And got it around 16:00
6/7/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh lol
6/7/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah they work until 17:00 or something like that I think
6/7/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pretty nice they actually did so many already within three days of the deadline
6/7/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: Hey, guys! Do you know if the score shown after uploading the turing machines for Automata include (count) the hidden tests as well?
6/7/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Those are not included
6/7/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It only shows the scores for the visible tests
6/7/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The other 24 will be done without showing you the results
6/7/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: Thanks a lot!
6/7/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Whats the highest score in points one can get ?
6/7/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: For automata ctm assignment
6/7/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: In Momotor
6/7/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 2 per uploaded assignment
6/7/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 6
6/7/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Alright
6/7/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: You can move 2IIC0 Business Information Systems Y3Q1 over to 2IHI10 Business Information Systems Y3Q3.
6/7/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Well, offcourse you cannot in OsirisPlanapp as it doesn't work and they haven't added 2IHI10 nor does the function work when you manually input it, but you should be able to! The option 2IHI10 Y3Q3 *should* be possible...
6/7/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: If you then swap Engineering design (Y2Q1) with Social Robots (Y3Q1) you don't have timeslot issues either
6/7/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: And you don't really need to plan SG activities like that, those are spread over the 3 years
6/7/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: You do. Or at least I do. OsirisPlanapp won't accept it otherwise, as it will say it's missing
6/7/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If you remove the package from the menu in the right you don't have to
6/7/17, 22:18 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: yes, already did that, thanks a lot !
6/7/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Guys, I justed uploaded my automata programs, but it says all my outputs are the empty string (just "#"), but when I test it, I get the answers they, expect, does anybody know where I fucked up?
6/7/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Do you need to write output or something somewhere?\
6/7/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Did you put the tape head on the leftmost non empty symbol?
6/7/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Should that be where it ends?
6/7/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yup
6/7/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: I didn't, thanks
6/7/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: After fixing that it should work
6/7/17, 22:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Though it'll prolly take momoter 10 centuries to reprocess your files
6/7/17, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: <Media omitted>

6/8/17, 10:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You're a boss
6/8/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: thanks
6/8/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: would it be easier if we have a CS-students page for it?
6/8/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Probably
6/8/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Don't we
6/8/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: What happens if you don't go to the use tutorials ?
6/8/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You have the afternoon off
6/8/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And mis possible informations but it's not really that useful tbh
6/8/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh, because I hear people saying that it is mandatory ?
6/8/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 2/4 group members should always be present according to the stydyguide
6/8/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: It "is" but only 2 of your groups must be present and they don't check it
6/8/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: It also says that you have to send a mail to them to let them know in advance that you won't come
6/8/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And they do actually check, at least they did last week in my tutor session
6/8/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Seriously :p
6/8/17, 10:49 - Luke Houben: Depends on your tutor, they checked last week
6/8/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I have never been check even the poster session they walked by and asked is everyone of your group here? 
We were like: uhm yeah? 
And they walked away
6/8/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: By energy it's a joke
6/8/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: They checked at som2
6/8/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: They take it more seriously at my tutor session Job 😅
6/8/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Unfortunately
6/8/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Our history tutor tried to beat rap god in syllable count, but further nothing interesting happened haha
6/8/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Som1
6/8/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I talked with the history teacher who wrote the history book and I asked him why the first chapter was so long and he just laughed and said: the first chapter has too many works I started writing faster after that...
6/8/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
6/8/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: They don't even take it serious
6/8/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I am not allowed to move courses of my major to different slots in my planning right?
6/8/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: If it is given you can but for some you need special permission to join the alternative course
6/8/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I moved the course algorithms to my second year
6/8/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Why wouldn't you be allowed ?
6/8/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: As long as you meet the prerequisites you should be fine
6/8/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: it feels like every single course i want is in q1 and q2
6/8/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Its like Tetris but it won't ever fit
6/8/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Same, I got 4 subjects in q2 next year
6/8/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Me too
6/8/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: You can check other people's planning on cs-students by the way
6/8/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: oh nice
6/8/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'd invite you to upload your own as to help othe

6/8/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Guys, my group for HTI had an 8/10 for the design assignment yesterday, but it just got updated to an 7/10.. Is that even allowed?
6/8/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
6/8/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes it is I think
6/8/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: As long as it isn't definitive i believe it is
6/8/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When it's in Osiris it should be correct
6/8/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: As in, as soon as the course ended they can't change it anymore
6/8/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Canvas is just notepad for them and us, nothing official
6/8/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Kay
6/8/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: But sucks man
6/8/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Anyone else here that wants to do courses from Multi level systems design? It sounds cool
6/8/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: How to submit your planning on plan app?
6/8/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Because then i can ignore this error
6/8/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Jep its either A or B
6/8/17, 13:03 - Bas Gieling: overlap in timeslots doesnt matter anyway right
6/8/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: anyone doing the teachers' track and noticed that the second package planning is fucked up and only shows that the courses/internships can be done in Q1?
6/8/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Why wouldn't they matter
6/8/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Combi students always have overlapping subjects
6/8/17, 13:46 - Bas Gieling: ^
6/8/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Oohh so its not a problem if you have overlapping timeslots?
6/8/17, 13:49 - Bas Gieling: idk, it cant a problem for combi students at least, as there are overlapping subjects in our standard program
6/8/17, 13:49 - Luke Houben: It's just difficult for yourself because you could have 2 lectures at the same time. But definately not forbidden
6/8/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: I thought it would be the case that if you have 2 courses in the same timeslot, it could be the case that your examens would be on the same moment?
6/8/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: yes, then you might have to make them in quarantaine.
6/8/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: So you make them after each other without being in contact with people who have already made them.
6/8/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Does anyone know what I should do
6/8/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: .\
6/8/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: did you make your own concept first niels/
6/8/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Pieter send that in the spam app
6/8/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: great quality
6/8/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can you perhaps just write it out what to do in words?
6/8/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I literally can't read what to do
6/8/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its not that clear in a gif lol
6/8/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Inspect element en then delete the disabled element of the button an voila
6/8/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Just use logical reasoning and you can figure it out yourself
6/8/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yes, because you take CG with another subject in the same timeslot
6/8/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: um yes ofcourse
6/8/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: which is going to be hell
6/8/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Open the menu where the 'indienen ter goedkeuring' is located, press F12, find the DIV that contains the option "indienen ter goedkeuring" and delete "disabled=disabled"
6/8/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thanks, this is exactly what I was looking for
6/8/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: H A C K E R M A N
6/8/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Oh wow it does for you? Doesn't for me, was just meant as a joke. Haha well glad it worked
6/8/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: mine works too like that
6/8/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Mine worked
6/8/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Mine says "Plan niet gevonden"
6/8/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no wat
6/8/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: way
6/8/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: was it really meant as a joke?
6/8/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: did you save it, and use a concept of your own?
6/8/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Ahh, made it the default planning and then submitted it, that works!
6/8/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Well there are no "real" errors in my planning so I just went ahead and submitted it this way haha
6/8/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: And it says that it is handed in, so i guess it works
6/8/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Lol yeah it was meant as a joke, hence why it was in the other chat 😂
6/8/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: So when you have it ingediend ter goedkeuring you should be fine for now?
6/8/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Guess so, yes
6/8/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: You never know
6/8/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: goddamnit TUe why is this shit so extremely broken
6/8/17, 14:12 - Luke Houben: We also have tomorrow to hand it in right?
6/8/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how to fix?
6/8/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: yeah tomorrow is the deadline
6/8/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Make your plan in a new concept max
6/8/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: And then overwrite
6/8/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what
6/8/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: You can add a new concept
6/8/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: That's what worked for me
6/8/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Concept -> overschrijf plan
6/8/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: That makes it the default one
6/8/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what???
6/8/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but
6/8/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: my old plan vanishes then or what
6/8/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: No
6/8/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ahhh i see
6/8/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight worked
6/8/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah but it's an easy USE course ;D
6/8/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: well, I still wouldn't recommand it
6/8/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: as you can't ever go to both the lectures at the same time
6/8/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: +the exams will be at the same time
6/8/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I know but otherwise my schedule won't fit ;/
6/8/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and CG needs 100% of your attention
6/8/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: that too
6/8/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's because all those fucking use courses are in a
6/8/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yup
6/8/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I've got the same problem
6/8/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: if USE was in a different slot
6/8/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I could've chosen the elective package I wanted
6/8/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so USE just sucks
6/8/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well I'm not gonna skip IIS because of USE
6/8/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: fuck that
6/8/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Anyone here btw who has some good typescript and angular2/4 knowledge?
6/8/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm having some troubles

6/8/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: did you upload them on the assignment page first?
6/8/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: because you have to upload them on the assignments page first, to see them on the momotor page
6/8/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah i did
6/8/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: i sent Vink an email
6/8/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: I have the same problem and I already uploaded them on the assignments page
6/8/17, 15:23 - Luke Houben: Same

6/8/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When you need to wait a day for the server to process every time you submit and the deadline is tomorrow
6/8/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good luck fixing bugs
6/8/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Im called Maas Adam Anton Sjoerd ;)
6/8/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice

6/8/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: they did that on purpose? awesome haha
6/8/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I got the same problem btw, but will check back later too
6/8/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Maybe another browser?
6/8/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah they did it on purpose
6/8/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Vink says just to wait
6/8/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: So you can submit multiple times?
6/8/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah
6/8/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: you can submit as often as you want
6/8/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Nice

6/8/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Automata be like
6/8/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Has anyone managed to do B6 completely right, because i thought i solved it but there's still a couple of bugs which make me cry
6/8/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: like a lot
6/8/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I'm already at 300 lines...
6/8/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: i did it within 200 lines
6/8/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: A lot of bugs or do they make you cry a lot?
6/8/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes
6/8/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm still stuck with fucking USE
6/8/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is Anniek niet goed genoeg?
6/8/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Makes me cry a lot
6/8/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ruben have you tried the method described above?
6/8/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: does yours work with this string? : abcabc*aabbccabcabcabbaa
6/8/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: This one
6/8/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: i can check for you
6/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Rick not related to the study so please don't
6/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Anyone had the error: "No assignments have been configured for use with Momotor at this time."?
6/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: would be nice
6/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah everyone has that error
6/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Vink says just to wait and if the issue still exists tonight i should send him another email
6/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: It does
6/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I just cannot submit yet because in the second quartile I have 2 subjects in timeslot A ;/
6/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I want to do both security and IIS
6/8/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Ah i thought i was special
6/8/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ahh I see
6/8/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: would you mind helping me? because i really don't know how to solve this
6/8/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: For me it works this way?
6/8/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Mine works too, 217 lines, comments included.
6/8/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah but you'll have the tests in the same timeslot
6/8/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Rick I think he means he doesn't want to submit it yet
6/8/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which kinda sucks
6/8/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ahh
6/8/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: I can try, don't have a lot of time
6/8/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Holy rick you have 4 subjects, two of them in timeslot a, in quartile 2
6/8/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah me neither, but am i the only one feeling this one was harder than a lot of others?
6/8/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Good luck with that
6/8/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: This one was hard indeed, the other ones i made were way easier
6/8/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I know, but it was the only option
6/8/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Aso, one of them is USE
6/8/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: I'm at use rn
6/8/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, I am doing four subjects atm as well as you can see
6/8/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And it is kinda manageable
6/8/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But how will you take the 2 tests?
6/8/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Idk if the tests are overlapping
6/8/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Otherwise: resit
6/8/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I don't mind doing USE and cg in the same timeslot because USE is fucking useless anyway
6/8/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This
6/8/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If you have 2 tests at the same time you can ask for quarantine.
6/8/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But having 2 tests at the same time sucks
6/8/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because you can't really do the resit since for that to happen you need to show up
6/8/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which is not possible
6/8/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: quarantine?
6/8/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Quarantaine whatever you spell it
6/8/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, but what does it mean in this context?
6/8/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah he's means what does it mean that you ask for it
6/8/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nvm
6/8/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Isn't the name self-explanatory? You have to do both test in a row, in a separate room
6/8/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: tests*
6/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ah
6/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And you can only leave when you have done both of them
6/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Wasn
6/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ahhh
6/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It wasnt really self explanatory :P
6/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ty!
6/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or I'm kinda retarded
6/8/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ah alright 😋
6/8/17, 16:10 - Luke Houben: I didn't get it either but thanks for explaining 😀
6/8/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ehh I have a scary sighting
6/8/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I fixed B6 no need for help anymore guys, thanks though
6/8/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I score 8.1 on the Physics resit and that shows up in Osiris, but for the course it still says I have a 5
6/8/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They didn't update that
6/8/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Shouldn't that be fixed by now?
6/8/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: people suck, remind them, send an email
6/8/17, 16:39 - Luke Houben: It got updated for me
6/8/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: It should be updated
6/8/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: thanks all three of you
6/8/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm gonna do what I do best
6/8/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: complain
6/8/17, 16:40 - Luke Houben: The final exam and overall grade were updated for me at the same day/time
6/8/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
6/8/17, 16:40 - Luke Houben: Go Daan, Go!
6/8/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For me they were just like "here is a meaningsless 8.1 because fuck you"
6/8/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: (complain in the mail though, not here ;))
6/8/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahaha
6/8/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I will M.A.A.S. No worries
6/8/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: like what...
6/8/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Totale weging van 170
6/8/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Je hebt 2 keer een weging 70, normaal en resit
6/8/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ja
6/8/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maar waarom doet die ouwe nog mee in de berekening
6/8/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Want zonder die 4.9 kan je niet onder een 5 uitkomen met die wegingen
6/8/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Lol 4.9 zuuur
6/8/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 8.1 fixed it
6/8/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: had een 5.6 nodig ofzo
6/8/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Still not fixed for me, please let me know if it fixed for some of you
6/8/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: My assignment doesn't show up anymore
6/8/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't show up anymore
6/8/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait what
6/8/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: I get the same screen
6/8/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Daan doesnt show up anymore
6/8/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: For me they also only updated the exam grade, but not the overal grade
6/8/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do I need to select something first or do I just start filling it in?
6/8/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They forwarded my email to physics department. When I get further response I'll let you know
6/8/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I would recommend making a new concept first, but after that just start adding your courses
6/8/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Make a new concept and fill that in
6/8/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Oke thanks!
6/8/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Oh and use the 'add year' button to create year 3
6/8/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hehehe
6/8/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: brilliant, thanks guys
6/8/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Do any of you guys have a recommendation for a fill course, Q2 not in timeslot A or C?
6/8/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I need one more :P
6/8/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Nope sorry, I had far too many courses in Q2 so didn't have to look for one there 😅
6/8/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Np :)
6/8/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: same robin
6/8/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: You have space in q2? Damm
6/8/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: When exactly is the deadline for submitting subjects, like midnight tomorrow?
6/8/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well probably not since you cannot officially do it yet lol
6/8/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So ny student that is non-it probably won't even be able to
6/8/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Haha, I guess you're right
6/8/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
6/8/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Read the mail
6/8/17, 18:10 - Luke Houben: GG for a TU
6/8/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Of course they only find out now
6/8/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Not when they decided that the planapp was fixed and they set a deadline
6/8/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: How amazing is it that almost all of the "solutions" are simply ignoring the error messages
6/8/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What error messages?
6/8/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is there someone in this chat btw who knows a thing or two about either typescript or angular2? I'm having some trouble and don't know how to fix my shit
6/8/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: <Media omitted>
6/8/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: huh wat de tering???????
6/8/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so they set us a deadline
6/8/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Well, I don't really wanna do 4 courses in one quartile, so I have to do my bachelor in 4 years
6/8/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And thus I have space
6/8/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Alot of space 😂
6/8/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and then dont want us to do anything for that deadline...?
6/8/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i am so confused right now
6/8/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: No Stef, they wanted us to submit, but as the planapp just doesn't function correctly they now changed their mind
6/8/17, 19:03 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: decent
6/8/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, they just can't fix what they promise to fix, which is quite bad actualy
6/8/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: actually*
6/8/17, 19:41 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, why business information systems can only take place at q1/C while in kick-off presentation for Q4 it says that it's being held in Y3Q1/D?
6/8/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: The slides make quite some mistakes lol, so Its probably D
6/8/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Never mind, on Osiris its also C?
6/8/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So
6/8/17, 19:44 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: In presentation it's D and a month ago it was D as well
6/8/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: It says it is in D for Y1
6/8/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And Y2 and Y3 its C
6/8/17, 19:45 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: But now it says C and screws up my plan
6/8/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So the slides are just not updated then probably
6/8/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: You could also take it in Q3 maybe?
6/8/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: There was a certain possibility for this
6/8/17, 19:45 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Only q1 is possible ;(
6/8/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: That sucks :/
6/8/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Are you allowed two courses in the same time slot?
6/8/17, 19:46 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's just sad cause I chose a package which fitted a month ago but now it doesn't at all
6/8/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: If you do not care about the loss in lectures and stuff
6/8/17, 19:46 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well yes but lectures at the same time and so might even be tests
6/8/17, 19:47 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Subjects are so almost the same 
Business information systems 
And business informations systems management lol
6/8/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 11725278‬: Does anyone know how far they are with the HTI design assignments
6/8/17, 19:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Also might be a stupid question but 
If package has somewhat 5-6 subjects I only need to choose 3 of them right? lvl 1, lvl 2, lvl 3
6/8/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jeah
6/8/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: sometimes its even stated in the package
6/8/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but since the descriptions in osiris planapp are always screwed up you might wanna check that on the tue website
6/8/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Doest it matter in which order you do the Security package?
6/8/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not really, just would think its better to do intro before advanced
6/8/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Security doesnt really have an introduction course, does it?
6/8/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Planapp: Deepening, Advanced and Advanced
6/8/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So it'll be fine then I guess
6/8/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Mb, 2 Deepening, 1 Advanced
6/8/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: It's fine, I did 3 advanced from a package of 6 subjects as well
6/8/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: You can also do it in reverse order if you want
6/8/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hahahaha alright thanks
6/8/17, 20:10 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: But overall for 3 years we need to have 180 credits right?
6/8/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Yeah, you have to plan 120
6/8/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: +60 from year 1
6/8/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So, mine fits in 3 years, with only one exception, 2 courses are going to be in the same timeslot
6/8/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: What if two tests end up at the same time?
6/8/17, 20:15 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Check if they have any
6/8/17, 20:15 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh, ofc, I can do that already xD
6/8/17, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Read back a bit, you can apparently ask for "quarantine" if 2 tests are at the same time. You will sit in a room and do both tests one after the other without leaving
6/8/17, 20:20 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ahh alright
6/8/17, 20:20 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Sounds spooky lol
6/8/17, 20:20 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Quarantine xD
6/8/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: wtf
6/8/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: thats so much
6/8/17, 20:23 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Which use subject would you recommend as the easiest one?
6/8/17, 20:23 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Or atleast a bit interesting
6/8/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Technology entrepreneurship
6/8/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Imo
6/8/17, 20:45 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Overlapping ;( 
What's about marketing? Anyone who also consider this ones
6/8/17, 20:45 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: One?*
6/8/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: How can we see the amount of points
6/8/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: marketing seems legit
6/8/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: it will give an error if you dont have enough ects when presing: validate plan
6/8/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: pressing*
6/8/17, 20:49 - Luke Houben: Does it matter for momotor that canvas renames the assignment A4.ctm automatically to A4-1.ctm?
6/8/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I am doing Marketing too
6/8/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nop
6/8/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: at least for me it didnt
6/8/17, 20:49 - Luke Houben: Alright thnx!
6/8/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: It still works in momotor I have -9 for some 😅
6/8/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: looooool nice man
6/8/17, 21:00 - Luke Houben: Lol wut? Damn
6/8/17, 21:00 - Luke Houben: Momotor is still not working for me tho
6/8/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Me neither
6/8/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: For me neither
6/8/17, 21:01 - Luke Houben: Why couldn't they just stick to peach instead of making us use a brand new, not tested system
6/8/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Does it say for you guys no assignments have been configured for use for momotor?
6/8/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Yes Sander
6/8/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Great. Technical issues again
6/8/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lol i just finished the assignment like 2 weeks back when momotor had no struggles yet sup
6/8/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I finished it too but someone tried to ask that in this chat but he couldnt send his messages in here
6/8/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: huh
6/8/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: thats confusing me
6/8/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Forget it then
6/8/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: mkay
6/8/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Would it be allowed to only pick two other subject of the security package since we already have one? And pick a "random" extra subject?
6/8/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yes
6/8/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i think so
6/8/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz 3 makes the package
6/8/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or at least 3
6/8/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thats what i though
6/8/17, 21:23 - Luke Houben: But they need to be coherent right?
6/8/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but i vaguely remember them saying that certain studies should pick certain subjects in a package since the other one is already in the major
6/8/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but it seems to validate
6/8/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: im also kinda confused since 2AC20 is in security but the introduction 2AC10 is not
6/8/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: the whole elective packages thingy is vague since all descriptions are the same...
6/8/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: true
6/8/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: and 2AC10 2AC20 and 2AC30 are also a package together
6/8/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: so the security ones overlap
6/8/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah
6/8/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no clue if its still allowed tho
6/8/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: well i guess ill mail them
6/8/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah well its just lame as fuck that they are now going to confirm it only when you have 90 ects
6/8/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so that makes a situation where you can do the subjects, even if its not allowed for the requirements you have to meet
6/8/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: which would mean that you are doing something which costs approx. 140 hours and is then semi worthless...
6/8/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz ok knowledge is not worthless, but still for ur bachelor its worthless
6/8/17, 21:36 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: in the mail they said they want to do it at the beginning of the new year
6/8/17, 21:36 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: so that would mean that if your fucked, it would only be Q1
6/8/17, 21:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hmm
6/8/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: okay
6/8/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but still
6/8/17, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: jup
6/8/17, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: makes 0 sense
6/8/17, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz the whole purpose was to give you feedback before you fuck up
6/8/17, 21:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: So if I need 10 more credits I can choose random subjects I want right?
6/8/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: If you got the packages yes

6/8/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: If you for example have your major untill year 3.5, can you directly after q2 start your master or do you have to wait that year?

6/8/17, 22:42 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Depends on master and uni
6/8/17, 22:42 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: But I know that some masters start in January aswell
6/8/17, 23:03 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: A
6/8/17, 23:03 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Its not b because it went from welded to bolted, not from bolted to welded
6/8/17, 23:04 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, why when i try to overwrite theplan it says 
Plan niet gevonden.
6/8/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Means plan not found
6/8/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: You probably never made a new concept and worked in the default one?
6/8/17, 23:16 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Oh yea
6/8/17, 23:16 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thanks!
6/8/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 57806988‬: My momotor page says no assignments have been configured for use with momotor at this time even though i did submit a right .ctm file how do i fix this
6/8/17, 23:18 - Luke Houben: More people have this problem matthijs
6/8/17, 23:19 - Luke Houben: We can't, Vink or canvas support team has to fix it
6/8/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: That's because uni is full of technical people who prove that their programmes are correct
6/8/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 57806988‬: Np thx anyway ill send Vink hatemail then
6/8/17, 23:40 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: where can you get to momotor to hand in the tm assignment?
6/8/17, 23:40 - Luke Houben: submit it in assignments tab
6/8/17, 23:41 - Luke Houben: on canvas
6/8/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: but i thought that there was somewhere you could see that it was accepted or rejected
6/8/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: In the momotor tab
6/8/17, 23:43 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: But that doesn't seem to work for some people rn
6/9/17, 09:40 - ‪+31 6 53907377‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 09:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, switch back to and from that tab
6/9/17, 09:44 - ‪+31 6 53907377‬: Like between Plan and Onderwijscatalogus?
6/9/17, 09:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah
6/9/17, 09:51 - ‪+31 6 53907377‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 09:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Whelp guess you're not allowed to make a studyplan
6/9/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 53907377‬: rip
6/9/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 53907377‬: Any idea why that would be?
6/9/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: secret redirection to fontys planapp
6/9/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: tried shift+F5?
6/9/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 53907377‬: I have now, still no luck 😭
6/9/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: My delete cache and cookies?
6/9/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 53907377‬: Still nothing
6/9/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: maybe*
6/9/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Strange..
6/9/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'd send an email then
6/9/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Maybe try a different browser
6/9/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But doubt it would work
6/9/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 53907377‬: Already tried that
6/9/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 53907377‬: Sent them an email, hopefully they don't take too long to address it...
6/9/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 53907377‬: Thanks for your help though :)
6/9/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: @31648187618 They now updated my overall​ grade of Physics, so I think the problem should be resolved for you as well
6/9/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks for the message Han!
6/9/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For me it is changed as well now
6/9/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: he guys and wizards, does anyone know how a telegram bot would read all messages in a group and relay them to a (kind like) twitter feed on a site
6/9/17, 11:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys i am still confused when the deadline is for the planapp
6/9/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: has anyone done this before, and how does one make this
6/9/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Never done it before, kinda have an idea how to do it
6/9/17, 11:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys?
6/9/17, 11:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I recieved email about the plan app
6/9/17, 11:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So should i just do it as it is and when exactly is the deadline
6/9/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: I've found how to make a bot that reads all messages, it's the making code that pushes it to a live feed part that's I don't know shit about, but could be general knowledge for some here
6/9/17, 11:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Can someone say ?
6/9/17, 11:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😐
6/9/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: you should just make ur planning
6/9/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and follow those subjects
6/9/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but it will not yet be confirmed to be a good planning
6/9/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so pretty gay imo
6/9/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm, the relaying to a feed part is done best by websockets(or socket.io, but that is just an abstraction layer): In the function that reads the message, you send a new message to through the websocket and on the website it has to display the messages recieved by the websocket
6/9/17, 11:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @Stef yes but the deadli e to validate and bullshut and so on is today inst it ?
6/9/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 11:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sooo guys can I do the following program :
6/9/17, 11:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Coherent : App Dev + Web Tech
6/9/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Not app dev
6/9/17, 11:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: USE: Robots /or design thinking
6/9/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Because you cant to app programming
6/9/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: thanks, I'll check out this socket.io
6/9/17, 11:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :{
6/9/17, 11:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what is a good alternative then :{
6/9/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You can do app development
6/9/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Just choose the 3 courses besides app programming
6/9/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yeah but if you want to do web tech as well
6/9/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: those overlap too much
6/9/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: so they wont count as 2 packages
6/9/17, 11:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :{
6/9/17, 11:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: fuck this retarded shit
6/9/17, 11:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so what is a good alternative then

6/9/17, 11:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: anyone ?
6/9/17, 11:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: also where can I see what other people chose in cs students
6/9/17, 11:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: nevermind found it but I still need help with any alternatives for a coherent package
6/9/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I took security + app dev
6/9/17, 11:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what USE?
6/9/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: robots everywhere
6/9/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: my planning is also on cs sutdents (just uploaded it)
6/9/17, 11:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oh thanks
6/9/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: some details are in the comments of the file

6/9/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well you can put a schedule in there
6/9/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If you use the HTML editor
6/9/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Okay but they still haven't fixed it yet great
6/9/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: read the email, you dont have to hand anything in yet
6/9/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: just make sure there are some courses in the planapp

6/9/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Did you start by making a new concept?
6/9/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just do that and hand in a screenshot 😂
6/9/17, 12:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: you mean new draft ?
6/9/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Idk what the name is in english for the tab

6/9/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: You need to go to save and select 'overwrite plan'
6/9/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Not change the name to default
6/9/17, 12:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 12:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yes I did but ... my draft was called D.M.Nikolov

6/9/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: No is your planning still there?
6/9/17, 12:52 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yes but the name is not Default planning
6/9/17, 12:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 12:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: how do I change it to default so the monkeys in administration are pleased

6/9/17, 12:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: no seriously
6/9/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, I get you're frustrated by this :P
6/9/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But it isn't gonna be solved anytime soon
6/9/17, 12:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so what the fuck do I do ?
6/9/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: What might help is writing a complaint to co@gewis.nl, but that won't help in the short term
6/9/17, 12:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: a new draft ?
6/9/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, and then copy probably
6/9/17, 12:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :{{{{{{{{{{{{
6/9/17, 12:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i don't trust this uni anymore in teaching me shit
6/9/17, 12:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: haven't seen a single thing they did that is decent
6/9/17, 12:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: not even good
6/9/17, 12:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but just decent
6/9/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, it is the 104th best university in the world
6/9/17, 12:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :O
6/9/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And the 3rd best university of the Netherlands
6/9/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But their information systems are just lacking
6/9/17, 13:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :)
6/9/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: This says more about the Netherlands than about this uni
6/9/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, Delft is above us somehow, so I don't trust that list :P
6/9/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I did a year in Delft and it is a mess there as well
6/9/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Especially the ICT stuff
6/9/17, 13:38 - Luke Houben: Do you need to do the USE courses in order of exploration - advanced - deepening? Or doesn't it matter that much?
6/9/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You need to do it that way unfortunately
6/9/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Isn't it exploration - deepening - advanced?
6/9/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah
6/9/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: exploration deepenin advanced
6/9/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Use yes, with the other packages it doesn't matter
6/9/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, with others it depends as well
6/9/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: For example, in IIS you need the artificial intelligence subject before you can do the DBL
6/9/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Ah, okay, nvm then
6/9/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: When is the New deadline?

6/9/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So who is the person to talk to to file the most efficiënt complaint regarding Vink's automata exams VS Zwaan's elementary school exams for the same 5 ECTS course?
6/9/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, take a guess :P
6/9/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: CO?

6/9/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: My bad, I thought I couldnt upload the ctm files because it said submit failed
6/9/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But I don't have an active Internet connection on my laptop right npw

6/9/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Haha, yeah that might be an issue that inhibits you from submitting :p
6/9/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: are there people posting use quizes to cs-students?
6/9/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 21917788‬: You have to make 2 custom courses for that
6/9/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: How long does momotor take? Because I have been waiting for a while jow
6/9/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And it is still processing
6/9/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Oh its finished now but it give different answers than the sim
6/9/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: How is that possible?
6/9/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: did you end your simulation on the leftmost non blank symbol of your output?
6/9/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: if not, then that's the problem
6/9/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Oh okay
6/9/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Thanks
6/9/17, 17:17 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It can be just blank next to leftmost symbol
6/9/17, 17:17 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Cannot it?
6/9/17, 17:18 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: According to their e mail
6/9/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: could be
6/9/17, 17:18 - Luke Houben: Nope just make it end on the left most symbol (non blank)
6/9/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Well, mine didn't end on that and it was accepted 😂
6/9/17, 17:19 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Same had left blank next to leftmost symbol
6/9/17, 17:19 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: 6/6 still
6/9/17, 17:19 - Luke Houben: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 17:20 - Luke Houben: So on the first symbol of the output string
6/9/17, 17:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Oh ur right 
Haven't seen this in webmail
Thanks man! And sorry for disinformation
6/9/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lel
6/9/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: At creating a new concept for planapp
6/9/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 17:31 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I guess you have to make planning DEFAULT not default planning? 
I might be wrong 
I thought so because on planapp it was mentioned somewhere that default one is the that supervisors can see
6/9/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "Default planning", not "Default" planning
6/9/17, 17:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: That's strange but Oke
6/9/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: thought so as well
6/9/17, 17:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Planapp is killing me
6/9/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's funny that while we have Automata, USE and such this system of theirs is actually consuming our time
6/9/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I am not able to create this, but I'm almost certain that 5 random people from this group could've delivered a working website in the past months they used for it
6/9/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: i am still a bit confused, how do you make it default?
6/9/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You can also click overwrite plan right?
6/9/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Then it changes from concept to plan
6/9/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but we should make a concept right
6/9/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yes
6/9/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But when you click overwrite plan then it becomes your plan and the supervisors can see it
6/9/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Thats what it says when you click that
6/9/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooh great
6/9/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And why is Automata (2IT70) not existing in the planapp course catalog
6/9/17, 17:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Is there still no option to rename stuff
6/9/17, 17:39 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Maybe you are searching it in concepts not subjects?
6/9/17, 17:39 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Happened to me twice xD
6/9/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no I found fundamentals in the same screen as this
6/9/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wait what
6/9/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I tried again and now it shows up ..
6/9/17, 17:40 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Strange don't you already have it in fourth quartile?
6/9/17, 17:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok i did the plan app think guys
6/9/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I couldn't select automata and now it disappeared again, other courses show up in the menu
6/9/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 17:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: If you meesed up the name you can just copy it to new concept and it will ask you for a name about this concept. Write Default planning and then  you have a concept with that name. After that just select the new concept and click overwritr pla
6/9/17, 17:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Then you will have a plan called default planning
6/9/17, 17:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 17:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: btw guys do you have to click validate plan or just save?
6/9/17, 17:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: anyone ?
6/9/17, 17:45 - Luke Houben: Validat plan just checks the ects you have planned in
6/9/17, 17:45 - Luke Houben: Just click save, hand in button is still disabled
6/9/17, 17:45 - Luke Houben: And make sure it's your default plan
6/9/17, 17:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 17:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: UHAUhuh
6/9/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wait a second
6/9/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Automata is not even in the entire course list for Q4
6/9/17, 17:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: guys how do i have to wait for the momotor shit ?
6/9/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: I've been waiting for 10 minutes now...
6/9/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: Is that normal?
6/9/17, 18:01 - Luke Houben: Yeah it can take even longer
6/9/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: Could be that I submitted it in a wrong format
6/9/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: O it's processing now 😊
6/9/17, 18:01 - Luke Houben: As long as you submitted it as .ctm and it says processing in momotor you just have to wait
6/9/17, 18:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Mine says queued 😐
6/9/17, 18:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 18:04 - Luke Houben: It can't process multiple programs at once, just wait a few minutes
6/9/17, 18:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Waw tue rips again 🏄😂
6/9/17, 18:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oki thanks
6/9/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah
6/9/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: Mine has been processing for 7 minutes now :S sorry 😂
6/9/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 😀
6/9/17, 18:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Can ut really proccess only 1 at a time 😐
6/9/17, 18:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sorry but this shit is getting anmoying as hell
6/9/17, 18:15 - Luke Houben: I guess that is why it is taking so long
6/9/17, 18:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Tue back at it with their advanced science
6/9/17, 18:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Seriously my grandpa with a brick in hand will trach it faster...😓
6/9/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Processing one at a time is the most efficient way of doing it assuming it can use 100% of the resources
6/9/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Just make the shit earlier then I guess 😅
6/9/17, 18:16 - Luke Houben: And if you tested your programs you don't have to wait for it to be checked
6/9/17, 18:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I dont think you need that much resources for this...
6/9/17, 18:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its not a big thing to check too anyway
6/9/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: It's better to see the machine that grades you programs also agrees
6/9/17, 18:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes
6/9/17, 18:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Because you never know what bullshit the tue made the machine check us with
6/9/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, momotor is gonna be open source
6/9/17, 18:19 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I know that they didn't make it scalable to multiple machines. 
They have one server and only one
6/9/17, 18:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So momotor.cs-students.nl might be a pretty good idea if it stays this slow
6/9/17, 18:20 - Luke Houben: Hmmm
6/9/17, 18:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Whaaaaaat the fuck .. are you telling me this shitty ass ctm requires so much resources that i have been queued for 15 min
6/9/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, something is very very wrong with momotor
6/9/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because the tests themselves take 0.20 seconds on average
6/9/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: No but If 100 students upload then yes
6/9/17, 18:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😓
6/9/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Or very slow server
6/9/17, 18:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Because tue doesnt have money for that
6/9/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Where can we find it?
6/9/17, 18:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: In the trash
6/9/17, 18:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Momotor.org, but they haven't reached a stable version yet(:X), so they aren't releasing it yet
6/9/17, 18:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 👌🤓 if we think it works then it should work'- tue 1911 - 6969
6/9/17, 18:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31618468934  did you get result 😂
6/9/17, 18:24 - Luke Houben: But for momotor we also need to use canvas😂
6/9/17, 18:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I would laugh so hard if someone made and infinite turning machine 😳
6/9/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wait, it does not check for that, right
6/9/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Lemme try in a bit :P
6/9/17, 18:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Rick i will find you
6/9/17, 18:25 - Luke Houben: There probably are dimitar but we don't know if they habe a time-out programmed
6/9/17, 18:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And i will make you suffer
6/9/17, 18:25 - Luke Houben: Otherwise it might continue 5 minutes for a certain input
6/9/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, imma try that :P
6/9/17, 18:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think tue lies with the testing times
6/9/17, 18:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 0.20 sec my ass
6/9/17, 18:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Rick dont pls
6/9/17, 18:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Pls papi i want to see first
6/9/17, 18:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🙃i will erase you from existance
6/9/17, 18:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @359886392842  can you continue threatening  to hurt Rick in the other chat? ;)
6/9/17, 18:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah sorry
6/9/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: JA DIMITAR DOE NORMAAL
6/9/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: We can see that motor isn't stable (yet)
6/9/17, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I accidentally made mine infinite at one point, because I looped it to the wrong state, but I didn't hand that one in
6/9/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: How long does momotor take to procees
6/9/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: between 10 minutes and 10 hours
6/9/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: A friend of mine submitted at 16:30 and is still queued
6/9/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: After it switches to processing it should take around 10 minutes
6/9/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Queue time depends on amount of submissions I would guess
6/9/17, 19:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I am still in que
6/9/17, 19:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Nice....
6/9/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Since when
6/9/17, 19:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 18.00
6/9/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Damn
6/9/17, 19:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Those other two are also already Mandstory for SfS😂
6/9/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Doing web science ;)
6/9/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But I believe it doesnt count as a package
6/9/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ohh right
6/9/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Welpp
6/9/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Idk then
6/9/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: automata was actually and elective for me
6/9/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: an*
6/9/17, 19:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hmm
6/9/17, 19:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Then I think it is a package
6/9/17, 19:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: That's true
6/9/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: App programming is forbidden for us because it has too much overlap
6/9/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: great
6/9/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: can you combine coherent packages? Since some have the same courses
6/9/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Both Algorithmics and Computer Science Essentials contain DBL Algorithms
6/9/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Then they might not count as two separate coherent packages, but I'm not sure
6/9/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait but then the choices get quite a bit less
6/9/17, 19:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because a lot require data structures for example
6/9/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: what...
6/9/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: They don't
6/9/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And you guys got some free point electives?
6/9/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: 2ix20
6/9/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: you da man
6/9/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: This seems pretty fun and easy
6/9/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: @31648187618
6/9/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'll check it out!
6/9/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Also, I forgot how it was to have to press a save button online for my progress to get saved
6/9/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When selected that one I still get the error that I need 2IW80 when I press validate
6/9/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: we know
6/9/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: 🙂
6/9/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: great
6/9/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: need 2 more courses to fill up Y3 Q3
6/9/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: just fake it and its fine
6/9/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: just act like the planapp is working and doesn't give errors
6/9/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
6/9/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "Just act like she can cook"
6/9/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sounds the same
6/9/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: true
6/9/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: Hey i know that guy
He is Still queued😩
6/9/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Nahw, poor kas
6/9/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Is it me or is canvas really slow?
6/9/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: With overal browsing?
6/9/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Probs the 50 students not doing automata until the last moment
6/9/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Finding out that monitor checking will be really slow on the last day
6/9/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Im not talking about momoter though
6/9/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: But momomotor is accessed via canvas
6/9/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: So its just a bunch of people lurking and refreshing
6/9/17, 21:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys for the momotor stuff you should get score 6 right?
6/9/17, 21:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thats the max ?
6/9/17, 21:20 - Luke Houben: Yes
6/9/17, 21:20 - Luke Houben: 24 more points are hidden
6/9/17, 21:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oke
6/9/17, 21:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Rip
6/9/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: Is it a problem that when turning the automata in for second time they get named a#-1.ctm?
6/9/17, 21:22 - Luke Houben: Nope
6/9/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Im still queued but i submitted around 15:30 does anyone know what to do
6/9/17, 22:49 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You can just ask somebody what are the inputs of test cases for your programs in moto and check it yourself
6/9/17, 22:49 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I don't think that if it works for you moto will find any mistakes
6/9/17, 22:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Since it just checks two really basic cases
6/9/17, 22:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It doesn't even care where is your tape head pointer
6/9/17, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah i already saw the test cases because i re-submitted but doesn't it matter for the deadline?
6/9/17, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: If it's still queued
6/9/17, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Nah, the files are on canvas right
6/9/17, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: momotor is just a way to get feedback
6/9/17, 22:51 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yep
6/9/17, 22:51 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Like it was with peach
6/9/17, 22:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: By the way, some use assignment grades are up 
But as far as I can see only few groups received them
6/9/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: <Media omitted>
6/9/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: we weren't at least
6/9/17, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: what? that the deadline is at noon?
6/9/17, 22:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well they mentioned it during our tutor hour (sdc)
6/9/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Maybe we'll just upload some random image just to see what kind of feedback we get
6/9/17, 23:00 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well I'll just say this feedback is mostly useless since you get it from the very same students who have no clue how teachers actually decide whether something is good or sufficient or excellent etc.
6/9/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: and from the same students that are oh so motivated to read others work
6/9/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Sounds like a plan
6/9/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: you can however get like 0-5 points for it though
6/9/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Just give everyone 5 points right
6/9/17, 23:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Wait
6/9/17, 23:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Really?
6/9/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: "perfection in a use case"
6/9/17, 23:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: 5 out 100 go for peers?
6/9/17, 23:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: And other 95 teachers?
6/9/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Better be some damn good 🍐 s
6/9/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Not sure if you get to judge other groups advice
6/9/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: or if they actually reed the stuff
6/9/17, 23:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Sounds like a plan to give everyone a 5 haha
6/9/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: idk
6/9/17, 23:02 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Who would the peers be tgen
6/9/17, 23:02 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Just all post a part of the Bee movie script
6/9/17, 23:02 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I though you get judged for the advice you give but not the advice you recieve
6/9/17, 23:02 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: yeah but i dont know if you get to judge the advice you're getting yourself
6/9/17, 23:03 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: probably yeah
6/9/17, 23:03 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: only 5 points though
6/9/17, 23:03 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: idk
6/9/17, 23:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Dear lord then I can upload any piece I want, and others will get fucked over because you can't peer review random text
6/9/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: That's what i thought the guy said
6/9/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: not sure tho
6/9/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: would be odd to be honest but then again why would you take the effort to give feedback
6/9/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: For the fun of it
6/9/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Knowing someone will read your ironic feedback makes it so much more worth it
6/9/17, 23:06 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well I guess feedback means nothin for this course 
We went for poster session to get feedback and more or less the whole feedback was : "well I don't know how they judge the poster, but I think it's ok"
6/9/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Is everyone handing it in last second my momotor has been qeued for almost 2 hours now
6/9/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yes
6/9/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: what did you expect
6/9/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I hope for USE people actually do eachother a favor
6/9/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You always have that one dick who burns down teammates because he notices a small error and doesn't have a further life
6/9/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Let that sink in a couple of days until the peer feedback 😂
6/9/17, 23:16 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Nah only best of the best are here
6/9/17, 23:16 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: So no worries haha
6/9/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Great

6/10/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Anyone else got their use assignment graded but no comment to check your individual grade?
6/10/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lemme see
6/10/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: which one do you mean?
6/10/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: What do you mean comment? Your grade is .6*group grade + .4*individual
6/10/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: like the history assignment?
6/10/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: if so, nop not graded yet
6/10/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Mine is already graded 😅
6/10/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nice
6/10/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: guess that depends on tutors
6/10/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ours said that he will grade everything at once
6/10/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or at least we will get all our grades at once
6/10/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But idk my individual points
6/10/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: You can click the rubric button at grades
6/10/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Should be
6/10/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Well nope thats the problem
6/10/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: The rubric is not there
6/10/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Nice
6/10/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: At least they're upholding the quality of the course

6/10/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since it's the weekend and the deadline for grading is not closing in I highly doubt it
6/10/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: still no guarantee lol
6/10/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: just like with programming
6/10/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but still

6/10/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: just depends on your case + timeslot
6/10/17, 15:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh 😅false alarm then
6/10/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: mine was graded a few days ago
6/10/17, 15:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So what was it  0.4 times your part +0.6 times total grade ?
6/10/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: was the individual part graded as well?
6/10/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: where can we find that?
6/10/17, 15:45 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: open rubrics
6/10/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: I think it's the other way around.
6/10/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: rubric just says
6/10/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we got everything exellent
6/10/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thats not the case though
6/10/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we got 71/100
6/10/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so... how do i see my individual grade?
6/10/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
6/10/17, 15:51 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: so in rubrics you check grade for your part
6/10/17, 15:51 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: * 0.4
6/10/17, 15:51 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: + 0.6 * 71
6/10/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh wow then your individual part is excellent?
6/10/17, 15:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: if everything is exellent how did you get 71 then?
6/10/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 71 is group work, you said the rubric is his part right
6/10/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or is the rubric everything in seperate columns
6/10/17, 15:57 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: like you have to have a table where every part is graded
6/10/17, 15:57 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: this is rubrics
6/10/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Rubik's Revenge
6/10/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: the rubric
6/10/17, 15:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: funny tho that there were supposed to be instructor comments next to each part
6/10/17, 15:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: but its empty :))
6/10/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I can not find how to open the rubric
6/10/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wtf
6/10/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: help please
6/10/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: not everyone has their rubric yet
6/10/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i do have my grade though
6/10/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: sander didn't have it yersterday evening either whilst he did get his grade
6/10/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: where do you find the rubric normally though
6/10/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>

6/11/17, 10:58 - Bas Gieling: 9/10
6/11/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thanks guys
6/11/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: BTW having multiple of these from every week uploaded to CS students might be nice for studying for the exam
6/11/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Question 6 is so sneaky because it went from welded to jointed not the other way around, so its A and we can use your anwers as 10/10 as well
6/11/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: but that sounds more like an error in writing the question.. Which makes it even more annoying because they do make such errors and say you could've guessed it then
6/11/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It's not an error, the answer is literally in the text (page 254)
6/11/17, 12:17 - Bas Gieling: right, fuck xD
6/11/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: lol sorry mate
6/11/17, 12:20 - Bas Gieling: its okay, that one point for one use test doesnt bother me :p but that ones actually a very fucking sneaky answer
6/11/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but the question in the weekly has it the other way around. Which could make you think like "ahh they mean that piece of the text but the fucktards just miswrote the answer here"
6/11/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That's possible, if you don't consider 'unusual design' as a synonym of 'peculiar design'

6/11/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I did not ;p
6/11/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
6/11/17, 12:40 - Bas Gieling: i had that question too right?
6/11/17, 12:40 - Bas Gieling: this is a tricky one as well, as some of the answers (like b) are already supposed to be essential values of engineers
6/11/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: ahh, I see thanks
6/11/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: indeed

6/11/17, 14:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: guys can you remind me again benthams view of utilitarianism is that every action is equal and no action is more important than another? like every good is equal and every bad is equal
6/11/17, 14:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and mills says that some actuals are more important than others and some effects are more important?
6/11/17, 14:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: amirite?
6/11/17, 14:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: uuuhg i read it and i think i am wrong

6/11/17, 15:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: naah i will do it later
6/11/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
6/11/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: <Media omitted>
6/11/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: (the rest of the answers were already placed here earlier)
6/11/17, 15:52 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: God bless 👳🏾🙏🏿
6/11/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: For the USE paper, I'm doing Virtue Ethics and am completely stuck on what to actually do. I have got my virtues, but how should I make a recommendation with them? What should I make a recommendation on?
6/11/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay, so your best strategy is the following
6/11/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You take this website: http://www.textfixer.com/tools/random-words.php
6/11/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Generate 500 random words
6/11/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Past them behind eachother
6/11/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: *Paste
6/11/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And it will probably get a 10/10
6/11/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Does someone have a serious answer?
6/11/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Recommendation should be about what should happen next
6/11/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: According to virtue ethics
6/11/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Okay, but if I look at those 'Virtues for morally Responsible Engineers' from the book, for instance, a recommendation would be for instance that they should use their expertise and objectivity to improve on (....)?
6/11/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: The book only looks at engineers etc but in most cases they are not relevant, you have to apply the basic virtue ethics stuff, for engineers that engineer such a thing would be what you just described.
6/11/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Ah okay, thanks!
6/11/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: the example exam of automata is about ch 3 and 5, right? is the exam also only about chapters 3 and 5?
6/11/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: oh, nvm, I've found out that it is
6/11/17, 18:21 - Luke Houben: <Media omitted>
6/11/17, 18:24 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: `a
6/11/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: A confirmed
6/11/17, 18:42 - Luke Houben: Alright thanks guys
6/11/17, 19:06 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Also in the pictures found ^
6/11/17, 19:12 - Luke Houben: Whatsapp on windows didn't display these images when i was working on the quiz😖
6/11/17, 19:20 - ‪+31 6 45422140‬: Guys any idea what username and password I need to log into the computers in the library?
6/11/17, 19:20 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: your s-number I suppose?
6/11/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: same as on canvas?
6/11/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 45422140‬: That doesn't work😕
6/11/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You can't log onto them afaik
6/11/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: They're for visitors only
6/11/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i could log in with my s-number i remember
6/11/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I wonder why with all the answers in this group I never get a 10/10
6/11/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: last week I got a 7 and this week a 9
6/11/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so whoever keeps lying and saying their answers are all correct: meh np i got a 7 without doing shit ty anyway
6/11/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: several questions are very similar and sometimes have the same options for answers
6/11/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: This indeed
6/11/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And you can check your answers tomorrow to see where it went wrong
6/11/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: this quiz had exceptionally many of those
6/11/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: how many more tests are there atually?
6/11/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 1
6/11/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ehh how are we supposed to calculate the grade of our own part of the history assignment for USE?
6/11/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/11/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But these are not 1-10 grades so should I just convert it to those first?
6/11/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: the total grade is your individual grade (that needs to be converted)*0,6 + group grade(8,45)*0,4
6/11/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: how convenient
6/11/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks Thijs!
6/11/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: np
6/11/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: pim mvp
6/11/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wait so your individual part is *0.6?
6/11/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I thought that one was 0.4
6/11/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Individual*0.4 + group*0.6
6/11/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ah right
6/11/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks Anne haha
6/11/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: * Personal grade Part A = 0,6 * group grade (CANVAS) + 0,4 * grade of your section
6/11/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: oh oops 😬
6/11/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: well that'd be an 8.7
6/11/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nice
6/11/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: echt een machine jij
6/11/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
6/11/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Werkte dat in crypto's maar zo goed
6/11/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: true
6/11/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: ja
6/11/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: wrong chat
6/11/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😘
6/11/17, 21:17 - Kevin Jilissen: Does anyone know for how much this week's "mandatory USE feedback tutorial" counts towards grade?
6/11/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: 0
6/11/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Right?
6/11/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Previous time if you werent at the poster session you would have a 0 for the assigment if they noticed
6/11/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Someone here who was some typescript knowledge? I'm getting an error and have no idea how to fix it
6/11/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And stackoverflow is of little help ;/
6/11/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: there are 5/100 points addressed to feedback 
idk if you have to be at the meeting though
6/11/17, 21:24 - Kevin Jilissen: 5/100 is not that bad, a 0 is 🤔
6/12/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hey people, just to be sure
6/12/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The Ethics paper should include Reflection as well right?
6/12/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In this draft version
6/12/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We haven't put it in there yet
6/12/17, 11:06 - Luke Houben: Nope not needed
6/12/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: lol
6/12/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Since we'd like to also include the reactions on our draft
6/12/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: great, thanks guys
6/12/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: good point
6/12/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: np
6/12/17, 11:06 - Luke Houben: Only part 1/4e
6/12/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: great
6/12/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That'd be 0.1 eth please
6/12/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Lol
6/12/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 37 dollar wtf
6/12/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahahah
6/12/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah well after including taxes etc not so much is left for me John
6/12/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: True
6/12/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah and he's got to find a buyer and this stuff is not wanted at the moment
6/12/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: he has to hold on to it and such
6/12/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Best he can do is 3 dollar
6/12/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yup yup
6/12/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Nothing needs to be in here, this is purely for feedback. Handing in only some bullet point of your planning would be acceptable, but then you get less useful feedback
6/12/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Although you could say feedback from other students is generally pretty meh anyway
6/12/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ehh our tutor mentioned quite clearly that your paper should be done before this deadline
6/12/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ah they said the opposite for us
6/12/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Why would it need to be finished anyway? Nobody marks this draft version, only the feedback given is marked
6/12/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: no thats not true i think
6/12/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: he said it would be advised to have finished at least everthing before the conclusion and reflection because otherwise you wont have enough time to fix things
6/12/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but since we are students we can wirte an entire 5000 word essay by ourselves in 1 day so meh
6/12/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
6/12/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is so true 😂
6/12/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Haha exactly Tobin
6/12/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: no but really i had to discover what a code of conduct even was and then i wrote 700 words on it, all in about 1 hour
6/12/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 500 was the indication🙄
6/12/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yes you are correct
6/12/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I have some citations in there so i actually wrote like 600
6/12/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Indication means you can do something else if you want Sander ;p
6/12/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I wrote exactly 500 words
6/12/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No jk
6/12/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: No just kidding?
6/12/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Wtf sander
6/12/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
6/12/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i wrote 600 or smth
6/12/17, 11:51 - ‪+34 647 43 92 48‬: I wrote 688 I think
6/12/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: I wrote 666
6/12/17, 11:52 - Bas Gieling: i have over 1000..
6/12/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Alright, alright, you win :P
6/12/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I wrote 1 long word
6/12/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So basically you wrote a French sentence
6/12/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: German
6/12/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
6/12/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Loooooo
6/12/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is the examplary exam for automata on canvas the only practice exam we have?
6/12/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Are there other groups in the DS section of USE that have had their grading but cannot see any rubric results?
6/12/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Our rubric thingy is just empty
6/12/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 🙋🏽‍♂
6/12/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: This was the case for me (self driving cars) as well. They will probably add it later
6/12/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 22540209‬: The tutor added a comment with the grades for us, so some tutors might not use the rubric at all (SDC2)
6/12/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: hey guys, when is the USE final exam?
6/12/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Monday 3rd of july
6/12/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: did anyone happen to solve A1 2016 for data structures previous quartile and have answers
6/12/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Assignment one for the weekly exercises?
6/12/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or what is A1
6/12/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yes
6/12/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: but from last year
6/12/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: not 2017
6/12/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
6/12/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh sorry then I don't have it
6/12/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: no problem thanks tho
6/12/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: gg isil
6/12/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/12/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The HTI part is not useful for most though haha
6/13/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Hey guys! for those of you who do the app in AndroidStudio for HTI, how do you work around the double/float imprecision for incrementing and decrementing the temperature by 0.1?
6/13/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: if anyone has the same problem as me and know what i mean 😀
6/13/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I'm not sure what you mean, but maybe you can fix it by using 0.1f so that it is considered a float instead of a double
6/13/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Yeah, I tried that.. and still, when I do 2.6+.1, for example, it shows 2.70000007 stuff like that
6/13/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: I don't have the course, but I think you mean that floating-point arithmic doesn't work as expected:
floating-point-gui.de
6/13/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: I tried rounding, but then the counter is acting weird ..
6/13/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Simple solution:
Use ints then cast as float, pseudocode:
(1+2)/10.f is the same as 0.1+0.2
6/13/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Thank you! I'll look into it!
6/13/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Oh will definitely try this one 😊 thank you
6/13/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You can decrease the precision
6/13/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: How?
6/13/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm, lemme look i tup
6/13/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: look it up
6/13/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22186778/using-math-round-to-round-to-one-decimal-place
6/13/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: THIS
6/13/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED
6/13/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: This is exactly what I did. And the result was that counting up shows correctly but then when I count down, then goes like 22.2-22.1-22.0-21.0-21.8-21.7...
6/13/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: So it skips the number 21.9
6/13/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That probably has something do do with the way it rounds
6/13/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: I typed it to the console, the computed correctly calculates 21.9, but displays then 21.0 😭
6/13/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Just read the link I posted, it's just how floating-point arithmetic works
6/13/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, then it is one of those typical bugs that makes you want to scream
6/13/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: I am screaming. Student assistant didn't help. And Natasha said she needs time to think 😰
6/13/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Oh..
6/13/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: It's because of how floats are stored in binary, just like 0,3333... * 3 = 0,9999....
6/13/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2100490/floating-point-inaccuracy-examples
6/13/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Maybe this will help you understand
6/13/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: A pretty crude hack would be to split at the dot, only get the first number after the dot and then convert that to string and join it back again
6/13/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Guys for automata howthe fuck do we go about exercise 1, proving that induction shit
6/13/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Just learn all proves by hard or are There actually people that can come up with that shit themselves?
6/13/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Most of it just basic induction
6/13/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Practice it a few times yourself and it won't be that hard to come up with yourself
6/13/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: when you get a new theorem you need to prove
6/13/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Basic induction but most of the Times There is so much detail that you cannot leave out
6/13/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I mean some proofs are a page long
6/13/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: may be crude, but I believe that a correcly good functioning crude hack is 100x more beatyfull then correct code that fucks with functionality
6/13/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Agreed, just saying that it is indeed a hack
6/13/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That's correct, but a lot of the theorems state something that's biconditional and therefore you have a left and a right side you can proof, but during the final they will only ask one of the two sides, which makes it actually rather annoying, but the proof itself is still kind of the same.
6/13/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hmm okay
6/13/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: Hello, people! Do you know if we can use the org.thermostatapp.util package when developing the app for HTI on Android Studio?
6/13/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yes because you're allowed to reuse all the code they provided in the template
6/13/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: So I guess so
6/13/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: Thats great
6/13/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: <Media omitted>
6/13/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It should be next to that thingy
6/13/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Like a link
6/13/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: Damn
6/13/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: How did I miss that
6/13/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: Was searching for a link on the wolfram site for an hour
6/13/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: lol
6/13/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Woops I did it
6/13/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wrong chat
6/13/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: anyone knows who i should mail for questions and remarks for automata?
6/13/17, 22:44 - Luke Houben: Either your tutor or vink
6/13/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: whats vink's mail adress?
6/13/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: e.p.d.vink@tue.nl dus
6/13/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That was a message to Stef once haha
6/13/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think it is correct
6/13/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It is
6/14/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: For people not present in the lecture: The pumping lemma questions will be about context free languages
6/14/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and that means....?
6/14/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: pumping lemma of CFL will be asked
6/14/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So free points for memorizing that by heart
6/14/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And some for the application
6/14/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: thats just the same as from the midterm then?
6/14/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
6/14/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or what
6/14/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For CFL's
6/14/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: nou nee
6/14/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: CFL is een beetje anders
6/14/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: maar niet erg veel anders
6/14/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Same idea
6/14/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Finish the pumping lemma: there exists an M for which
6/14/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: ... For every word w in L with |w| >= m...
6/14/17, 12:00 - Bas Gieling: ... there exist v,w,x,y,z such that w = vwxyz, and ...
6/14/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: how romantic
6/14/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: you guys know how to get my calculator wet
6/14/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ye

6/14/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: hey guys, is the coming USE-tutorial mandatory to attend?
6/14/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
6/14/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: so... if i dont/cant attend i get a 0? -_-
6/14/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Probably not
6/14/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: if you really cant and are worried that its mandatory, why not just send an email?
6/14/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: it'll probz be answered before then
6/14/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i already did
6/14/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Poof :p
6/14/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: she hasnt aswered :S
6/14/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and since ur so far up front they know its not a lame ass excuse
6/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Then it isn't a problem if you don't go
6/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ah good
6/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Mail your tutor not Katleen, tutors are quicker
6/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: She is the tutor for some people
6/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hmm
6/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh oops haha
6/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sucks to be them
6/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: less good
6/14/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We got a cool Belgian guy who keeps asking dumb questions
6/14/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: stupid whatsapp doesnt wanna send my messages again
6/14/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lel
6/14/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: loool we got a merican who does understand what hes doing
6/14/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: yeah, i got kathleen teaching us
6/14/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: why am i not surprised to see belgian and dumb questions in the same sentence

6/14/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: because it says to feedbacks...
6/14/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I think it is just one pp
6/14/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: one otherwise it wouldn't make sense
6/14/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Yeah*
6/14/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because TU/e chooses the option that makes sense normally
6/14/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Honor mails have been sent
6/14/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: you in?
6/14/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Me and storm are 👌🏻

6/14/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: is there any other USE group that hasnt gotten an email about the feedback?
6/14/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: none of us even knew we had to do anything *before* tomorrow, we thought we had to do it during the tutorial session since none of us received anything to even give feedback to
6/14/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, they sent a mail to your canvas mail box
6/14/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Its really retarted
6/14/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: no they did not to use
6/14/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: us*
6/14/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Really ? Oh, that's even more retarted
6/14/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: they basically forgot about our group
6/14/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: What group are you?
6/14/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Lol Tobin wtf.. Did you submit your work on time?
6/14/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: we are group P
6/14/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: SOM1P and yes we submitted in time
6/14/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: they responded saying oh whoops sorry
6/14/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Should the feedbacks be anonymous?
6/14/17, 17:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: you say your group
6/14/17, 17:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: not your name

6/14/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: his office?>
6/14/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: MF, floor five, from the elevators go left through the door and right, at the end of the corridor his office is on the right
6/14/17, 18:13 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: aah okay
6/14/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Whisper "Maybe I should consider going to Fontys" and he'll come to you.
6/14/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: is there a set time for visits?
6/14/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I've walked in there without an appointment quite often
6/14/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So if they are not in a meeting or talking with someone you can walk in
6/14/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: ah great, thanks for the info
6/14/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you have to pull a number and wait until it appears on the sign
6/14/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: btw jort and sander did you two get notified of anything or did you just receive nothing for the honors stuff?
6/14/17, 18:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: @31623837581 @31681422900
6/14/17, 18:22 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: we got a very nice email saying we can go fuck ourselves
6/14/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: not quite that extreme but he wished us good luck with the rest of our bachelor
6/14/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I see
6/14/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: can you show us your mail?
6/14/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Anybody who went to the examplary exam lecture today and wrote down the answer to excercise 3?
6/14/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: do you have an answer? I can confirm it, didnt write it down though
6/14/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: yeah I wrote down something, although I am pretty sure it is wrong 😅
6/14/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: show me

6/15/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did the USE feedback email take a lot of time for others as well to show up in the mailbox?
6/15/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When you use reply all
6/15/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: because I sent it a few minutes ago and I did not receive my own email yet
6/15/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Did you do it in canvas?
6/15/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No I did it the way the instructions in the mail stated
6/15/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I now received my own mail, so it is good
6/15/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I only recieved the feedbacks from the other groups, not from the email I send myself?
6/15/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: are you supposed to recieve your own mail?
6/15/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: i dont know if you will get your own email if you are the one who send it
6/15/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: maybe ask someone from your group if he/she received it
6/15/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Are you kidding me
6/15/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: All the way here for mandatory session to learn 2 hours about a reflection?
6/15/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: You must be kidding me😭
6/15/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Let's give face to face feedback because all the group's apparently can't read
6/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Really?
6/15/17, 13:53 - Luke Houben: Why is use such a BS?😒
6/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: They discuss the mails sent?
6/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah I think so
6/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Apparently
6/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What are you referring to :p
6/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You have to discuss it face-to-face now
6/15/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yes that
6/15/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Which is useless
6/15/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: imo
6/15/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We are not discussing face to face
6/15/17, 13:54 - Luke Houben: Probably depends on the tutor again
6/15/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ugh
6/15/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Belgian guy is asking questions and watching awkwardly until someone saves him by answering it
6/15/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: But only saves him after a good 30seconds of akward silence
6/15/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And why the heck does he assume we need extra Kant lecture because no one wanted to answer
6/15/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You're here as well right?
6/15/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: everyone in our group never answers to our tutor
6/15/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: she has too high hopes for us
6/15/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I am here for some mandatory peer feedback session and until now he is just asking whether people understand stuff to which no one is answering anyway
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Wait is today mandatory?
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Need to leave at 15:00 and maybe I won't even have my feedback then
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah they said so
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He stated so today as well
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: our tutor is talking about zoos
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: We got our feedback already
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: and animals in cages
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: wtf
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Via email
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: yes, we all did
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah Andrei but the verbal feedback haha
6/15/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Face to face
6/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Way more fun
6/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: but we need to discuss it
6/15/17, 14:08 - Luke Houben: Like why
6/15/17, 14:08 - Luke Houben: Just why
6/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: He is explaining kant and virtue ethics again but nobody cares
6/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Just go to zoo
6/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Same
6/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: For feedback
6/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: But ours is a woman
6/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: And looks good
6/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: So ppl listen
6/15/17, 14:08 - Luke Houben: Who has kathleen here?
6/15/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I am on the edge of telling him honestly that no one wants to answer these questions and we just want to move on
6/15/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Do it
6/15/17, 14:11 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yesterday you said tomorrow
6/15/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
6/15/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: dont let your dreams be dreams
6/15/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Nop i have mine at 15:45 but every week its the same with his questions
6/15/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yep
6/15/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: looooooooool
6/15/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: sounds like u got scammed bigtime
6/15/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: WHY IS HE EXPLAINING HOW TO GIVE FEEDBACK AFTER WE GAVE FEEDBACK
6/15/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Cuz they are idiots?
6/15/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This yes
6/15/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would you say it please
6/15/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I talked to him enough
6/15/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Think we get his point
6/15/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 46247309‬: It's feedback for your feedback
6/15/17, 14:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: <Media omitted>
6/15/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: yes, so you can do something with your feedback you got feedback about so you can improve your original feedback and your paper so more people can give feedback
6/15/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Try not to send needless pictures and gif in this group
6/15/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Also this
6/15/17, 15:47 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Alright 😯
6/16/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: for the USE peer feedback stuff, should each document have the author on it?
6/16/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Yes
6/16/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Because you get individually graded on the way you gave feedback
6/16/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ah okay
6/16/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: seems logical lel
6/16/17, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fuck

6/16/17, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but idk
6/16/17, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You only need to add the names in your own essay
6/16/17, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i just put it in to be sure lol
6/16/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Not in the feedback thing with the other groups
6/16/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Try reading the study guide
6/16/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: @31643470096
6/16/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You don't need your name on there
6/16/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: You will hand in the feedback you give together with your individual part of the final assugment
6/16/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: fair nuf
6/16/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 👍🏻

6/16/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: The answer is the fault tree thing.
6/16/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: With that addition 10/10
6/16/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: 👍🏻😜

6/18/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: when do we have to register for the P-exam? is it after you have completed all 1st year courses or after you have passed them?
6/18/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Passed them all
6/18/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But you can deregister as well
6/18/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When is the deadline for it?
6/18/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
6/18/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks
6/18/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah it's more a formality so that they know how many people they should count on
6/18/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: also, am I a nominal student?
6/18/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nominal means passed everything so far
6/18/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: sounds fancy
6/18/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yep haha
6/18/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's nothing to be worried about, just sign up if you don't miss any ECTS yet
6/18/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
6/18/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And if you fail a resit just deregister
6/18/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: sounds like a solid plan
6/18/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: where do i sign up
6/18/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Osiris?

6/18/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: <Media omitted>
6/18/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: i think its a (they hit the weels with a sledgehammer bit the rubber absorbed the hits)
6/18/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: the procedures didnt work out due to the new materials
6/18/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Hmm okay, u sure?
6/18/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: its not b (they decided to use the ribber to increase comfort and dodnt look at the risks of it.)
its not c (they didnt look at the problems the rubber caused)
its not d (they used tests from slow trams for the rubber tests)
6/18/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: leaves a
6/18/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: ah ty!
6/18/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: What if you have 45-55 ECTS?
6/18/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No Propedeuse for you then
6/18/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You need to get it next year
6/18/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But then there is no fancy ceremony
6/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 45 is to pass your BSA and to continue to the next year
6/18/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 60 in first year gets you the P ceremony
6/18/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: You have to get your P in 2 years right?
6/18/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: NO
6/18/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Great more tries for calculus
6/18/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: If you reach 45 ETC in your first year, they can't force you to quit anymore right?
6/18/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Well im not sure
6/18/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Given that you don't need 20 years for you bachelor?
6/18/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is the case in Delft. Not here
6/18/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No
6/18/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 45 is the limit
6/18/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Get that and you are fine
6/18/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: At 10 years you need to pay back all OV costs
6/18/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you have no degree then
6/18/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Your loan also stops at some point i think
6/18/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: They would still love you after 20 years tho
6/18/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I added a pdf with all the proofs we need to know of automata to cs-students
6/18/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: thanks!
6/18/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ty
6/18/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: also uploaded a lot of summaries from studeersnel
6/18/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: still the most backward rule in the whole system: "no degree and no job, better start paying back an extra 100 per month studied, 100 * 12 *  10  = 12000
6/18/17, 15:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :D
6/18/17, 15:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: "free stuff"
6/18/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we got a place to drop USE answers yet?
6/18/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: on cs students or smth
6/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No I like this part man.. You can travel for free for 10 years and all you need to do is at least get an MBO 4 degree in those 10 year
6/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: even though that takes the most stupid people 3 years to get
6/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's litterally saying "here you can travel for free as long as you manage to go grocery shopping without dying"
6/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: About the same difficulty
6/18/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: how can we register for the subjecs of next quartile? I do not manage to find subjects for which I can register when i search on osiris
6/18/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: and how can I register for the "propedeutic exam"?
6/18/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: ↑

6/18/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Computational will make my 60 points hard but that's how I like it
6/18/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yep
6/18/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Got proof now that she's even more retarded then I thought
6/18/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: damn
6/18/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I had a whole nice feedback PDF document seperately
6/18/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: cropped it into the essay file now
6/18/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I wonder what those people have been doing for 7 years (considering she's in her PHD now)
6/18/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is that really 7 years of discussing opinions of dead people?
6/18/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How do you not feel useless then
6/18/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ok so bottom line is:
You have to submit your work and add the files you and groupmember "graded" to your own essay. There's a very high chance that this will trigger a plagiarism alert (if you want to know what to do then ask @31630168397) but according to Kathleen this won't matter. Also when adding the files you need to make sure that if you added comments to the file (so select a sentence, and add a comment) that you take this comments out and put them into seperate qoutes or something. Because Kathleen wants to print out all the essays (hooray for being such a enviroment friendly person) and if you print out the pdf file with comments, the comments just show up as hightlighted lines and will make zero sense. I had to discuss about this with her for about 20 minutes and explain how comments and such work. So I highly advice y'all to take out the comments and put them into quotes or something so that Kathleen can print them and continue being a retard.

6/18/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: there's an automatic way to generate those 'quotes' if you don't know
6/18/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But ehh Ruben, I suppose we don't need to include the entire essays we gave feedback on?
6/18/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: She's already getting those from the owners if I'm correct
6/18/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Honestly I have no clue
6/18/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: After 20 minutes I just gave up and was done
6/18/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I asked her countless times about plagiarism issues but she waved it away everytime
6/18/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So no idea
6/18/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I know but she doesn't and she won't do it for you
6/18/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: yea I'm just including that automatic quote generation with the complete reviewed report

6/19/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: For USE btw
6/19/17, 11:01 - Luke Houben: Uploaded the one exam from canvas to cs-students
6/19/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: And you need 41/60 questions for a 5.5
6/19/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: And you need 41 out of 60 for a 5.5
6/19/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Haha
6/19/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I love double info
6/19/17, 11:01 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Wat
6/19/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Gamble correction
6/19/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 50 multiple choice 10 true false
6/19/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is not that bad actually
6/19/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: It is doable
6/19/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But what about the rumor some people shared that you would get points subtracted for certain false answers?
6/19/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Not true
6/19/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: great
6/19/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Always fill something in they said
6/19/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Does anyone know when we get out grade for the cTM assignment
6/19/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Great, so no open questions
6/19/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: When in doubt pick the longest answer... often right
6/19/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not if u dont answer the rest right?
6/19/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so.. false answers will nog be punished?
6/19/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not*
6/19/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Oh so you need to.get 41/60 anyway? Damn...
6/19/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That sucks
6/19/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: You do not get a penalty for wrong answers
6/19/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice
6/19/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Then how does gambling penalty work?
6/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Only after you get 25% of the grades it starts to count
6/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what??
6/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: As you can get 25% of the points with gambling
6/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: And 50% for true false questions
6/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how does that work then?
6/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i dont get the system
6/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Thats by far the gayest way of gambling correction ever
6/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Jort because you have to have 41 points instead of 33/60 (60*0.55=33) for a 5.5
6/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Say, the test has 60 questions. 25% of that is 15, so 15 points is a 0 and they start counting after that
6/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but..
6/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wth
6/19/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no way
6/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so you basically start with a -2.5?
6/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so the n-term is -2.5
6/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or what
6/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So if you get 30 points, that normally would be a 5, but now it will be a 3.3
6/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No with a 0
6/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Jeah but thats.not.true if uou need 41/00
6/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 60
6/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this is such bullshit what the fuck
6/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Max Just get 41 points ffs
6/19/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dude
6/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Wait how many points for a 5?
6/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i can still bitch about how fucking shitty this course
6/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is
6/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its such bullcrap
6/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: How.much for 5.0?
6/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: 41/60
6/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: For a 5.5
6/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Wow
6/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How much for 5.0?
6/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Not 5.5
6/19/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: 38?
6/19/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Something like that i.guess yeag
6/19/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: 37.5
6/19/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: It's the same as the final high school exams
6/19/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I think
6/19/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: They also had the correction
6/19/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Can you ask if they use questions from the canvas tests?
6/19/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: They do
6/19/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Nice
6/19/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If we can collect all questions on CS students
6/19/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its both ethics and history right?
6/19/17, 11:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes but i belive more is on history
6/19/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That would be strange
6/19/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guys why are some peopel complaining about guessing average?
6/19/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's kinda normal
6/19/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 41/60 means you have 68% of the answers correct
6/19/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: With multiple choice that is not so harsh
6/19/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pretty sure most have a weekly average of at least 7
6/19/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and that was without serious studying
6/19/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Are u defending the uni daan
6/19/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well to be fair in this case I am haha
6/19/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: But the online tests aren't guess corrected are they?
6/19/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guessing average is not something weird they came up with
6/19/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: true, my mistake
6/19/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For psychology they used it as well in Q1 and just like this that was studying some facts and theories
6/19/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: If they were I'd not get more than 4.5
6/19/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And after some studying you could pass it easily
6/19/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I had to do the resit but I didn't do a lot
6/19/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: At the resit I scored nicely
6/19/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys
6/19/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the a&pt exam is ONLY about Ch.3 and 5 right>
6/19/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ?
6/19/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: jesus
6/19/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: call it automata
6/19/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I was decrypting that for 10 seconds
6/19/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But yes
6/19/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is where the focus lies
6/19/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Not just focus
6/19/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Questions will only be from chap 3 and 5
6/19/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Are there past exams
6/19/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: For automata
6/19/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Enough?
6/19/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No
6/19/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There is only one Vink gave us
6/19/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: All the others are made by Gerard Zwaan and are easier, and NOT representative for our course
6/19/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The easy version is tought in Q1 by Gerard
6/19/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which is fucking bs btw
6/19/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I have sent a detailed mail about it to the Gewis CO
6/19/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No response yet
6/19/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: When did you send it?
6/19/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 2 days ago I thinj
6/19/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Think*
6/19/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: saturday
6/19/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Could be 3
6/19/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm, then it isn't that long ago
6/19/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I didn't say it is 😛
6/19/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Otherwise you can send a schopmailtje
6/19/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: haha, considering she has weekend as well I will give her another day
6/19/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys, do you have any idea where I can get a piece of paper proving that I am a TU/e student
6/19/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Proving my student status actually
6/19/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I need to show that in order to skip going to the army
6/19/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Proof of enrollment?
6/19/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You got a bewijs van inschrijving?
6/19/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Did we get that by mail or post
6/19/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 55027679‬: Post
6/19/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
6/19/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You got that in september
6/19/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But Dienstplicht is not active right?
6/19/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ooh that one
6/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Turkish one is Daan
6/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I got the letter when I became 18 and it just said well nothing happens
6/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oohh
6/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Negative part of the cafetaria model
6/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
6/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Lol
6/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But wait you are Dutch as fuck
6/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why do you need to go to the army in Turkey
6/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If your parents are turkish you get the turkish nationality automatically
6/19/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I mean you speak Dutch better than most Brabanders
6/19/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And you can never denounce it or how you call it
6/19/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ah damn that sucks
6/19/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So you have to do the Turkish militairy service, or otherwise you aren't allowed to enter the country anymore
6/19/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sorta, at least
6/19/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ah well that is a good thing right
6/19/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then they cannot force you to do stuff for them anymore
6/19/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: <Media omitted>
6/19/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Failure to follow procedures for routine checks was not the reason.. right?
6/19/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Because that was
6/19/17, 12:17 - Casper Smits: Because they did check the wheels, but they ignored the fact that something was wrong
6/19/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Read the case study
6/19/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: They almost give it away
6/19/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Okay, I'll double check it
6/19/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: The test is the 3 juli right?
6/19/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I hope so
6/19/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because then automata is that friday
6/19/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: so we have more time for that
6/19/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah 3 juli is USE
6/19/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: This is correct, they did check the wheels so that is not a reason why it led to the diaster
6/19/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: It says in the case study that they checked and even said that the diameter was 862mm
6/19/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: They also explicitly mention that they looked at existing experience and materials theory
6/19/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And about the routine checks they said that they did do them, but not good enough for the type of wheels (or something like that)
6/19/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is the resit roster for 4th quartily already known? So the resits in august?
6/19/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes, there is a pdf file with all the dates
6/19/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: People who used the weekly modeling quizzes to practice the theoretical part, did you notice whether they used those same questions on the exam?
6/19/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: they sometimes did, and often they were pretty similair
6/19/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nicee
6/19/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Using those now to practice for the resit 🙂
6/19/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Any idea where I would be able to find it? I've been looking around the TU/e site without much success
6/19/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: i might have it
6/19/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: but i dont know where i saved it rip
6/19/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: xD
6/19/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: i also might have it
6/19/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I might or might not
6/19/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Same, I'll be home in a few minutes, will try to look it up if anyone hasn't found it by then
6/19/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering I am not gonna look I wish you good luck
6/19/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😛

6/19/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: beat ya to it
6/19/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: i think
6/19/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: awesome thanks
6/19/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: wait the pages are fucked up
6/19/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is it possible that that pdf fucked up with the layout?
6/19/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: ill send the excel
6/19/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah thought so already

6/19/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: np rubaino
6/19/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Modeling resit doesn't have the free points for open questions 😢
6/19/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: at least the grading will be fast
6/19/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: true
6/19/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: it was the same with midterm but i dont remember if it was similiar to the final exam
6/19/17, 15:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Modeling resit doesn't have the free points for open questions 😢
6/19/17, 15:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What do you mean by that
6/19/17, 15:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31648187618
6/19/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: there wont be open question on the exam
6/19/17, 15:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ...🙄
6/19/17, 15:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But...
6/19/17, 15:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How do we get the points from them ?
6/19/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 20/20 multiple choice now
6/19/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No more open questions
6/19/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: how many do we need to make correect to pass
6/19/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ou tof multiple choices
6/19/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: depends on you grades
6/19/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 20/40 gives you a 5
6/19/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They don't do guessing average
6/19/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So I need 20/40
6/19/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not sure about you
6/19/17, 15:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hmmm
6/19/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 22/40 gives you a 5.5
6/19/17, 15:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How do we calculate our modelling grade again ?
6/19/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What do you mean
6/19/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: what was your project grade
6/19/17, 15:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Eeeh let me check i guess
6/19/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: 10% for maths weeklies, 40% for project 10% for intermediate, 40% for final
6/19/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: basically if you did something during the quartile you need a 5 voor the final exam
6/19/17, 15:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/19/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: clearly yes
6/19/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You can see you have an average of at least 6.0
6/19/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So 5.0 it is
6/19/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: aka 20/40
6/19/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: good luck with the calculus this way though 😛
6/19/17, 15:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I hate the calc part sooo much
6/19/17, 15:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😓
6/19/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Does anyone know what this "weight: 30" grade is of automata on osiris
6/19/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That might be the programming exercise??
6/19/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: That one was 20%
6/19/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: And intermediate is 20% as well
6/19/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Right?
6/19/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, I am a bit confused indeed
6/19/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: When do we get Turing machine exercise grade...?
6/19/17, 16:05 - Kevin Jilissen: <Media omitted>
6/19/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: What
6/19/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That was previous year
6/19/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is this from Vink's website?
6/19/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: What??
6/19/17, 16:06 - Kevin Jilissen: yes
6/19/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or Zwaan?
6/19/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I didn't even participate
6/19/17, 16:06 - Kevin Jilissen: http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/2it70/
6/19/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: So wtf is this
6/19/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: According to canvas it is 20%
6/19/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That's from last year
6/19/17, 16:07 - Kevin Jilissen: That was last year, don't know if it is still the same
6/19/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I already mailed him about it
6/19/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yeah we didn't even have a "participation grade" lol
6/19/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But this is definitely the cTM grade guys, because my midterm is a 6.0 and I got a 7.7 on Osiris
6/19/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Waiting for an answer now
6/19/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or a mix of both that should count 40% maybe
6/19/17, 16:08 - Kevin Jilissen: I got 9.5, so whatever it is for, I'm happy xD
6/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What was your midterm score Kevin?
6/19/17, 16:09 - Kevin Jilissen: 10
6/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: LOL
6/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: This is so weird
6/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Only went once
6/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Implies that my participation grade is a 9
6/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: John
6/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That's from last year
6/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: they didn't do that this year
6/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I think it is the cTM assignment and the interim test combined indeed
6/19/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Where can you see that grade?
6/19/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I'll send a mail
6/19/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Our dearest Anne already did
6/19/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think this as well, because it is higher than my midterm but lower than my expected grade for the cTM's
6/19/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Well in Osiris the course info still says 30% intermediate and 20% programming assignment, so they probably didn't change it yet
6/19/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Cuz I got a 2.5 for the interim and now i have a 5.3 on osiris but I'm 100% sure I got higher than 5.3 for the cTM assignment
6/19/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Wtf I had a 9 for the midterm and osiris says a 9.5, no way that I got a 10 for the cTM
6/19/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Exactly daan
6/19/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Oh okay nice
6/19/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
6/19/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I had a 5 for interim so if this is now suddenly a 7.7 you don't hear me complaining
6/19/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 6*
6/19/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: \
6/19/17, 16:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ... wtf is this
6/19/17, 16:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: O is the final 70%?!
6/19/17, 16:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😐
6/19/17, 16:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How do we see ctm and interm separately? Or we cant because tue strikes again
6/19/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: For some mathematics subject they also haven't changed the weight in osiris yet although it is different from last year, probably the same for this
6/19/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I will wait on a mail from vink
6/19/17, 16:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Anyone to answer me ?
6/19/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: No because i am not sure
6/19/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Haha there is a nice big 7 in my screen thats alright
6/19/17, 16:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/19/17, 16:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 6.8 same but... why is it weight 30
6/19/17, 16:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Is the final 70%
6/19/17, 16:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😠
6/19/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Because osiris is not updated
6/19/17, 16:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I swear fix your canvas  tue has a worse administation than american healthcare

6/19/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I think it is the grade for just the ctm assignment
6/19/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, this is OSIRIS
6/19/17, 16:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😠meany

6/19/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If it is Both, why is it 30?
6/19/17, 16:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😂
6/19/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Yeah idk but I cant have combi grade on 7 I think
6/19/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: There is no reason for it in any case
6/19/17, 16:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Well maybe final is 70%
6/19/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I have combi grade of 9.5... I dont mind
6/19/17, 16:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🤷🏻‍♂
6/19/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No Final is 60
6/19/17, 16:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🤷🏻‍♂
6/19/17, 16:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: It looks like a combined one

6/19/17, 16:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Does that mean final is 50%???
6/19/17, 16:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And this is ctm ?
6/19/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Miss me with that gay shit nigga 😠
6/19/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: According to old weights, they aren't updated yet
6/19/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So now its 60? Or 70?
6/19/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And what we have is ctm ? Or combined
6/19/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I am so confused
6/19/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🦑
6/19/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Just wait for clarification by Vink

6/19/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Just got a 9 instead of 8
6/19/17, 16:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😓
6/19/17, 16:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🙃i want to murder a cat now
6/19/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wait modeling is being changed in this quartile? lel
6/19/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: not modedling
6/19/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What do you think about trying to calculate it? Considering you know your interim grade for a couple of weeks now
6/19/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: sorry i meant use
6/19/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: haha okay
6/19/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But Dimi
6/19/17, 16:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah daan i know
6/19/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you have three grades, of which 2 are used in a calculation you know to form a final grade
6/19/17, 16:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But since we are not sure if its combined or not
6/19/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: you can calculate the one unknown variable 😛
6/19/17, 16:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Wow rly boi you enlightened me man many thans friend of friends😂
6/19/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahahaha
6/19/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think it is combined, because the grade was combined worth 30% last year
6/19/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This year it should be 40% I'd say
6/19/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: last year the interim combined with group participation was 30%
6/19/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: This wasn't combined with the Turing machine assignment, it was combined with you participation during tutor hours
6/19/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes I know, but I am reasoning here John
6/19/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Yes, and the cTM was 20% and the exam was 50
6/19/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Yeah okay
6/19/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: But I don't know what's happening this year
6/19/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This year there is no participation grade so you are left with interim only for that old 30%
6/19/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: my interim does not match the grade that is uploaded by far
6/19/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So there is something else added
6/19/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Only thing we have left is cTM
6/19/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: considering they uploaded something to Osiris and the midterms were known long before the cTM grades, we can conclude that if this is only the cTM then the midterms should be on there by now as well
6/19/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Unless this is a combination grade for both
6/19/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: counting 40%
6/19/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Why would they give it a test date of 30-5 then
6/19/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: When the cTM deadline was 9-6
6/19/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: (assuming that they fill that in correctly)
6/19/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did the test occur at 30-5?
6/19/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Nah weeks before that
6/19/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What happened at 30-5
6/19/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Its so fk weird
6/19/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: is it in between the two deadlines maybe?
6/19/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Idek
6/19/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wby can they never do anything right from the start jeez
6/19/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because they have a lot of possible excuses to fail Stef
6/19/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So they don't need to try harder
6/19/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Let's just wait on vinks reply
6/19/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why do you think all enthusiastic graduating masters move to cool companies instead of staying at the TU

6/19/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: But he is on like some other dimension or smth

6/19/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: i think just having a working automata that does things accordingly will get you an 8
6/19/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: plenty of time*

6/19/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Yeah and were not too lazy with your commenting
6/19/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: 60% is to get the right answers

6/19/17, 17:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So getting 1 off
6/19/17, 17:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Is not equal to a 9
6/19/17, 18:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thats what i thought
6/19/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How did you call them??
6/19/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: A1.ctm.ctm and B6.ctm.ctm
6/19/17, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: he said 1 out of 10
6/19/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: even if that means 1/10 per incorrect name per assignment it still would be -2/30
6/19/17, 18:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: They should be called A1.ctm B6.ctm
6/19/17, 18:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Not double ctm
6/19/17, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: no shit sherlock

6/20/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no nvm i dont mean b

6/20/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hmm alright
6/20/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its just easier to put two 1's on the stack when adding an a instead of requiring 2 b's to remove one?
6/20/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Does someone know if and how you can print @ laplace?
6/20/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Does any know how to make the thread constantly update in android studio? Because for us the time and text views only update when we press a button and we dont quite understand how to make it update constantly
6/20/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: I've got this question too, anyone?
6/20/17, 12:27 - Kevin Jilissen: What are you exactly trying to achieve?
6/20/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: To update the currentTemperature
6/20/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: The activity needs to be reloaded constantly so you can see the clock change and see current temp change ect
6/20/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: But currently it only updates when your reload the page or press a button
6/20/17, 12:29 - Kevin Jilissen: On a different thread where you have a reference to your text field, you can just use the post method on the textfield to queue a runnable to the UI thread which will update the text. This can only be done on that thread
6/20/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: ^
6/20/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Do you see a printer somewhere?

6/20/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: we made it in our web-app such that it kept updating continuously, but then it didn't take long before the server decided it was too much to handle two integers continuously

6/20/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: They have the same unknown dimension
6/20/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: So x+y = y+y
6/20/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: If ee talk about dimensions
6/20/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Read it as (time*time)/time + time
6/20/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Dimension would be time + time
6/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oooh
6/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: you're smart
6/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks!
6/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Haha np
6/20/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: A is not an empty string though is it?
6/20/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: In 0 steps it has to be right
6/20/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: in zero steps the input is just A
6/20/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: since we'd have to take a step to derive the empty symbol from A
6/20/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but we cannot take a step
6/20/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
6/20/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Where did you get this list of theorems and lemma's to learn? Or is it just some random ones
6/20/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31648187618
6/20/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Slides
6/20/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: there was a place on canvas where erik put some lemmas and theorems to learn right?
6/20/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: where did i find those again
6/20/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I uploaden all of those to cs students
6/20/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i thought they were on the homepage but cant find them anymore
6/20/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight
6/20/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: The can also be found in the slides of the recap
6/20/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: It
6/20/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but are those the only ones we need to be able to reproduce?
6/20/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yeah
6/20/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: its 12 a4 tho
6/20/17, 14:00 - Kevin Jilissen: np :)
6/20/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: damn alright
6/20/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: holy shit
6/20/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I believe I plagiarised those from @31643222030
6/20/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31642623926 , how long does it usually take Patricia to answer an email?
6/20/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm, idk
6/20/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Do we not need to know parse trees for the exam?
6/20/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: of automata
6/20/17, 15:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Pumping lemma, LTS theory and the proofs
6/20/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: *pumping lemma for CFL's
6/20/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah but that should be clear by now
6/20/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: LTS theory?
6/20/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Logic and Set theory
6/20/17, 16:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Logic Theory Set theory? "}

6/20/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Lol
6/20/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Translation?
6/20/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: She can't do shit
6/20/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what is the mail jou sent her?
6/20/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because Vink is in his right
6/20/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you*
6/20/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/20/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: have you asked vink about it yet?
6/20/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: "misschien zou je tussen die tentamens kunnen kijken voor meer oefenmaterial"
6/20/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: er zijn 2 andere 'tentamens' die vrijwel hetzelfde zijn
6/20/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: en die hebben geen antwoorden
6/20/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wat heeft vink erover te zeggen
6/20/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hij heeft btw t tentamen voor dit jaar sws al af
6/20/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dus we zijn toch wel rip
6/20/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Vink reageert wss weer in casual wartaal
6/20/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Dus of je er veel aan hebt idk
6/20/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: kunnen het tenminste proberen
6/20/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ik vond zijn fountain uitbeelding wel leuk
6/20/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: succes haha
6/20/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ik heb deze gestuurd
6/20/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Er is waarschijnlijk vrij weinig aan te doen :P
6/20/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Je kunt het nog hogerop gaan zoeken, maar meh
6/20/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Het mag opzich wel wat ze doen, het is gewoon gruwelijk kut
6/20/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Je zou het nu express kunnen falen en volgend jaar bij zwaan kunnen gaan zitten als je het echt zo'n probleem vind
6/20/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: can we use java code from last years thermostats in hti?
6/20/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: sure
6/20/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You can use anything you can find
6/20/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Paul said it himself
6/20/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just use references to your sources
6/20/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: :)
6/20/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "if it is already done, don't redo it, don't reinvent the wheel"
6/20/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "but make sure to refer to your sources to give them credit"
6/20/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: the api is quite a pain in the ass
6/20/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: the readme is limited
6/20/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: so it is hard to use if you want to use it fully
6/20/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lel you guys need difficult stuff for Android apps
6/20/17, 21:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: plebbies
6/20/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: There are entire studies dedicated to this "app development" 
Hti we assume you  can do it
6/20/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: "They've had Java in the first quartile right? They'll be fine"
6/20/17, 22:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: they only want you to develop a functional interface though, you can copy all the api and examples they give you and use anything from the internet
6/20/17, 22:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You could literally copy an entire app and slightly adjust it to what you need from it
6/20/17, 22:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They would be fine with it
6/20/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's about designing the interface, not showing you can code stuff from the ground up
6/20/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "human technology interaction"
6/20/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Something else than app development
6/20/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well I'm gonna show both lol
6/20/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you can that's quite the achievement Ruben haha
6/20/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Since I spend way too much time on the coding part
6/20/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Seriously
6/20/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But it is not a necessity and it will probably not even get you more points at this course
6/20/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But if you can than that is nice
6/20/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nope you're right
6/20/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But it did make designing our interface a shitton easier
6/20/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: What chapters are not in the data structure exams again?
6/20/17, 23:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 1, 2, 4
6/20/17, 23:59 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: oh really
6/20/17, 23:59 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: what about 5?
6/21/17, 00:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ohhh fucj
6/21/17, 00:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Dude
6/21/17, 00:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Forget that
6/21/17, 00:00 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: 😂
6/21/17, 00:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I thought you were talking about Automata😁
6/21/17, 00:01 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: yeah thats what it sounded like ;D
6/21/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 3 and 5 is in the exam
6/21/17, 00:09 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Not automata
6/21/17, 00:10 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: I was wondering about data structures
6/21/17, 00:10 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Only no range tree's I thought
6/21/17, 00:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Interval trees = range trees right
6/21/17, 00:12 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Computee geometry or sth
6/21/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nope
6/21/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ah okay
6/21/17, 00:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: #angular4
6/21/17, 00:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Shh you
6/21/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: can someone explain to me what a bisimilarity is in a normal language?
6/21/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i.e. English or Dutch, but not Erik Vink's bullshittery
6/21/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and yes, I am hereby proclaiming "Erik Vink's bullshittery" as an official language
6/21/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When I am bullshitting I also tend to confuse myself
6/21/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So he's doing that a lot
6/21/17, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so.. no explanation?
6/21/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Not within 12 minutes no
6/21/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: MIght still come
6/21/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think that bisimilarity means that while two LTSs may be different, you can't tell which is which just by looking at what available transitions you have at any point
6/21/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: So if you go through to bisimilar LTSs and always take the same transition for both of them, you will always have the same available transitions for both LTSs
6/21/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its possible to have bisimilarity between two states in the same lts
6/21/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what does that mean then?
6/21/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah. If two states of the same LTS are bisimilar, then that means that of you run the LTS twice, but have one starting at q1 and the other at q2, then you have the same thing basically
6/21/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: (where q1 and Q2 are the two bisimilar states)
6/21/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the same output yields the same result or what
6/21/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: iinput*
6/21/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk what you mean by "basically the same"
6/21/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It means that q1 and q2 have the same outgoing transitions, and of you take the same transition from both states you end up in two other states that are also bisimilar
6/21/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ahhhhh i see
6/21/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so the states you arrive at are also bisimilar
6/21/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: okay
6/21/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i see
6/21/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and the same goes for bisimilar LTSs?
6/21/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Bisimilarity of two states is like bisimilarity of two LTSs, except that you take the same LTSs twice but with different starting points
6/21/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight
6/21/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks!
6/21/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: do we need to know colouring tables?
6/21/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yu
6/21/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yupp
6/21/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck
6/21/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Litterally 10 year olds can do it
6/21/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh
6/21/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is it really that easy
6/21/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because
6/21/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: looks
6/21/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: interesting
6/21/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What can this state do? An 'a' transition and a 'b' transition, Lets give it color 1
6/21/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Sounds advanced f0r max
6/21/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hmm this other state can do the same Lets also give it color 1
6/21/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Oh this other state does something else, Lets color it 2
6/21/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how many columns do you have to do tho
6/21/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how long do you have to keep going
6/21/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: You have to keep going until the number of unique colours you used stays the same. Then you are not really changing the colouring scheme anynorw
6/21/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Anymore*
6/21/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so, when the colors of the states dont change when we do another step?
6/21/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or just when no more colors dissapear/are added
6/21/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That means the same
6/21/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: lol
6/21/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Or, well the name of the colors change
6/21/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no it does not
6/21/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But then it would not matter as you could color Them the same
6/21/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i mean the number of colors can stay the same while some states still change colors
6/21/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah
6/21/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Could be
6/21/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Its only about the number of colors
6/21/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If they are the same as previous step you can terminate
6/21/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
6/21/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: And if the initial states from the 2 LTS's have the same color they are branching bisimilar
6/21/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so its fine if the states change colo
6/21/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: r
6/21/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: okay
6/21/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It only matters which states have the same colour
6/21/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
6/21/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Nvm its not important
6/21/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: are there no answers of the exercises beyond 5.1.2 for automata?
6/21/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nope
6/21/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Not yet
6/21/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Maybe Vink will still give them
6/21/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But chances are low
6/21/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ugh
6/21/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck this course
6/21/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: There are answers
6/21/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: They are on cs students
6/21/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Someone posted a book
6/21/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: They are Alex', he got fed up with Vink as well
6/21/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I have one more question
6/21/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: a tao transition that does not to the capability, can we omit them or is it mandatory to mention them in parenthesis?
6/21/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is mandatory, because it might become relevant as well
6/21/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (Also, it is a Tau transition, not a tao transition)
6/21/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah but, it might become relevant in a later column
6/21/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if the toa transition isnt relevant in the column youre making at the time
6/21/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: there should be no use in mentioning it
6/21/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL you fucked the word "Tau" up even more now
6/21/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Second one was on purpose
6/21/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah its not like i meant to or anything
6/21/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I fell for it
6/21/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Underestimated your capabilities
6/21/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: just answer my question please instead of bitching about the way i write the word tea
6/21/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sorry Max you are further into the material than I am
6/21/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Green is better for health
6/21/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Black more for the britsh
6/21/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I got lemon tea, hmmmm
6/21/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i cry
6/21/17, 13:53 - Bas Gieling: our instructor was really vague about that max, im just gonna mention them every time, just to be sure
6/21/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
6/21/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: is this the exam we took
6/21/17, 13:57 - Bas Gieling: i think so yea
6/21/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alrighty then
6/21/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but
6/21/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if the tie transition isnt relevant
6/21/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we write down the transitions from the state at the end of the töà transition right?
6/21/17, 14:24 - Bas Gieling: if you mean by "not relevant" that it brings you from one colour to the same colour, then yes
6/21/17, 14:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/21/17, 14:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i don't get the up and to the left and down to the right part
6/21/17, 14:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: both look like they are going up and to the right
6/21/17, 14:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :{
6/21/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: because P is minimized, it should stay down as much (it's on the y axis) and because Q is maximized it should go to the right as much (it's on the x-axis), which is why it's E
6/21/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: *as much as possible
6/21/17, 14:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oh ok i get you
6/21/17, 14:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: the up and to the left part in explaination is very confusing
6/21/17, 14:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so we look at majority
6/21/17, 14:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: in that case its good
6/21/17, 14:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanks :3
6/21/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Is there any group who checked for Zeno behaviour in UPPAAL for dbl embedded systems?
6/21/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: What even is Zeno behaviour?
6/21/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Zeno_behaviour

6/21/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I still think "Hoofd, schouders, vuist in Daphne" is his best song
6/21/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Although "De meeste Romy's zijn bedrog" is good as well

6/21/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i got it now thanks
6/21/17, 20:32 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: How? I still don't get it
6/21/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: you check the stable equilibriums
6/21/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: they are 1 and 9 here
6/21/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: and 6 is between 3 and 9 so between there the limit is 9
6/21/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: becuz 9 is stable
6/21/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: also same for hundred, since there are no more stable equilibriums after 9, limit for 100 also equals to 9

6/21/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: where do we get this from
6/21/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: why does it have to be like that
6/21/17, 21:12 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i mean yeah it makes sense but
6/21/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: why 1
6/21/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Because e^0 = 1
6/21/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is there a place on the Tue where I can plasticize an A4 or something like that?
6/21/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: In the reproshop
6/21/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Alright, thanks, wanted to make sure :)
6/22/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
6/22/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or do we actually need to write it out
6/22/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Write it out I guess
6/22/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But I have no clue how
6/22/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Are There more use exams available anywhere apart from the one exam given?
6/22/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this is literally the proof they give tho
6/22/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: why would we need to do it differently
6/22/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Because you dont have a on the exam
6/22/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: can i have the slides of modeling somewhere
6/22/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how are you guys gonna go about learning the proofs from automata by heart?
6/22/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i have no idea how and where to start
6/22/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I am seriously not going to worry too much until I have studied all other exams enough
6/22/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And that final mondag till thursday cram as much in my head as I can
6/22/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Try to get a 5 with luck and memorizing
6/22/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Worst case automata resit but pass all others
6/22/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the thing is.. the exams consist of proofs
6/22/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The others are doable
6/22/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 1/3 of all exams are proofs
6/22/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then we can get a 6.7 without them
6/22/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So a 5 is doable
6/22/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so youre just gonna throw out 1/3 of your grade?
6/22/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No
6/22/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: also, are there more than one automata exams available?
6/22/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Haha, what I meant is first make sure I know modeling resit and USE more than plenty
6/22/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ahh i see
6/22/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And then start to do as much as I can for the proofs
6/22/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah alright
6/22/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not gonna throw it away but not gonna use time for it I cannot spare
6/22/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The 5.2 for DS was enough as well of course
6/22/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how are you gonna prepare for use
6/22/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because wtf
6/22/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yah alright
6/22/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: seems fair
6/22/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is there a decent USE summary available?
6/22/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes, there are on CS right?
6/22/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is all about the books, and those have summaries
6/22/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i heard that the questions are about events and shit
6/22/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: like the doors of that ship not closing
6/22/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: those arent mentioned in the summaries
6/22/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: case studies or sth?
6/22/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: uhm i guess
6/22/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: yeah those are the case studies
6/22/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: they are in some of the summaries i believe
6/22/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: this
6/22/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck this course man
6/22/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: for real
6/22/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: automata from erik vink is so shit
6/22/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its the wordt
6/22/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: worst
6/22/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: who in their tight mind would expect 300 students to learn 12 pages of proofs by heart
6/22/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
6/22/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its such bullshit
6/22/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: omg i didnt study that much for automata yet and ur scaring the shit out o fme
6/22/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: of me*
6/22/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i think gonna spend summer memorizing 12 pages
6/22/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck erik vink man for real
6/22/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what is he even thinking
6/22/17, 13:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: There is still time stop panicing you dumdums ... from experience i can say that panicing makes things worse
6/22/17, 13:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31621372984  i wish it was only him that is shit
6/22/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idc how much time there is, learning 12 pages of proofs by heart is not something you can ask of someone
6/22/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this quartile is the worst
6/22/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: for real
6/22/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: USE and automata
6/22/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck off please
6/22/17, 13:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🦑this is literaly only happening with our major btw
6/22/17, 13:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Other majors started with 120 ppl avrage and now they are 90
6/22/17, 13:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: We started with what ? 450? Now we are 160
6/22/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The problem is not only the length but mainly the lack of structure and readable sentences
6/22/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah Dimi but our major has got top notch job guarantees if you can say your name in social field
6/22/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how is this ever even going to help us
6/22/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well to be fair I think we will need to bullshit our way through some interviews and discussions later in life
6/22/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: when is someone gonna come up to me and say "QUICK! PROVE THAT IF x -> x' AND y -> y' THEN xy -> x'y' OR YOU LOSE YOUR JOB"
6/22/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is a proper practice for that
6/22/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: btw
6/22/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the exams on cs-students are from gerard zwaans course right?
6/22/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: for automata?
6/22/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I believe they are
6/22/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yaah
6/22/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We only have 1 exam from Vink
6/22/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
6/22/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The one he gave us
6/22/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so theyre completely useless
6/22/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: vinks exams are the shit ones?
6/22/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes
6/22/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Vink's (ours) are the difficult ones Isil
6/22/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so we only have one exam, consisting of 3 exercises, to practice?
6/22/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes
6/22/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: well ain't that just fucking great
6/22/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is correct, unleses @31642623926  says I am not correct now
6/22/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I believe there is more
6/22/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: where?
6/22/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: wait ill send it
6/22/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: its similar ot the one he gave
6/22/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: <Media omitted>
6/22/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: exercise 2 and 3 are different i think
6/22/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i mean, exercise 1 is the only one i want to see more different ones of
6/22/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yeah i get that
6/22/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so thats completely fucking useless as well
6/22/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck me
6/22/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: have found an other one
6/22/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: with a different first question
6/22/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: <Media omitted>
6/22/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice

6/22/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: so that makes three tests
6/22/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ill upload them to cs student
6/22/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: where did you find it?

6/22/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: old site of vink
6/22/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: might find some more if i can find 2014 2015
6/22/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: dig deep then :p
6/22/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: i think they are just overwritten
6/22/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: found 2013 2014 tho
6/22/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: which has no proof eventhough its vink's
6/22/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: and another one with the same fucking proof
6/22/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: with answer tho...
6/22/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: damn its so bad Ilse starts cursing
6/22/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so what ur saying is, either its a really fucked up proof or no proof at all??
6/22/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: old ones have no proofs but i would not trust that
6/22/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I found even older but that just looks like fundamentals so not worth posting
6/22/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: There are only 3 tests that I'd trust
6/22/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: but yeah, no answers and stuff kind of sucks
6/22/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: The older ones have some good exercises just not all
6/22/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: And one of the old ones has the solution to question one of the one we got
6/22/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Maybe it's a smart thing for everyone to upload their USE weekly questions to CS-students so we can make a nice file with all the questions and answers we have?
6/22/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Yes sure
6/22/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So who's gonna have time to type them all out in an ordered LateX file
6/22/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because images suck ass
6/22/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 🙆🏿‍♂
6/22/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You found yourself something to do Nick
6/22/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or Rick if he wants to

6/22/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Where is that stated
6/22/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: This is jort's example exam btw
6/22/17, 17:02 - Kevin Jilissen: In the algrorithm, you only use InsertionSort if n < 100, otherwise MergeSort is used
6/22/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 👆🏻
6/22/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Oohh wait I get it I misread that part I thought it said the other way around but now it makes sense thanks!
6/23/17, 07:08 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Anyone else on the DS resit train
6/23/17, 07:08 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: ?
6/23/17, 08:21 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yes hakan
6/23/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Nice

6/23/17, 09:45 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: I would recommend basing your proof on the pigeonhole principle.
6/23/17, 09:47 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh okay thanks
6/23/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You assume that the keys are divided equally
6/23/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Which doesn't have to be the case
6/23/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: It can also be the case that all keys are hashed to the same slot
6/23/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But for the rest I would say it's a valid proof
6/23/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: For the assignment I proved it in 2 ways
6/23/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh yeah that's true indeed it doesn't state that it is SUH
6/23/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah okay thanks that's better indeed
6/23/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Np!

6/23/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
6/23/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jeez dante
6/23/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: thats not very helpfull
6/23/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then just read the book
6/23/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Less pages
6/23/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Yeah the book
6/23/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Less usefull though
6/23/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nop
6/23/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Is really good
6/23/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: this is still less
6/23/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lol
6/23/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 3 summaries is 3*16 pages
6/23/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: the books pretty boring imo
6/23/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Much repetition and slow explanation
6/23/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Like the lectures
6/23/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jup
6/23/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but the questions are so fkin specific
6/23/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do they have practice exams? If so, just do those
6/23/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They tend to take the same sort of questions
6/23/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: 1 practice exam
6/23/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: one
6/23/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: the one on canvas
6/23/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and its like the weeklies
6/23/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: specific as fuck
6/23/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ctrl f helps you answer everything
6/23/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but you cant during ur final
6/23/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That's why I suggested everyone to upload their weeklies on cs-students
6/23/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so thats gonna be an issue
6/23/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: damn good suggestion
6/23/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This needs to be a good overview and not some mess of 300 questions dumped together
6/23/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and how do you suggest we do that?
6/23/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: divide them per week
6/23/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jeah but i mean, how are you gonna fix that they are all correct and no double ones occur?
6/23/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: you can't
6/23/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Although I remember Rick saying something about the LateX versioin
6/23/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: (not pressurizing Rick but it is a good idea for someone who has some spare time
6/23/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sort of a homemade practice exam of 20 questions
6/23/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or maybe more
6/23/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: guys for hti what should be included in the ZIP if you do a android project?
6/23/17, 13:01 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Whole project folder I guess?
6/23/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: what aboud a APK?
6/23/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: It says in the assignment to provide source and binary code, so I guess that means an APK too
6/23/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Does someone still has the exam of data structures?
6/23/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: have*
6/23/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I might
6/23/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Lemme check
6/23/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope, you weren't allowed to take it with you
6/23/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (It is from Jort's example exam)
6/23/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Where is this question originally from
6/23/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: .
6/23/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: .....
6/23/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: IM NOT ASKING THAT
6/23/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: did jort write that question??
6/23/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Im asking where it was originally from..........
6/23/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: From an assignment??? From a past examm??
6/23/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It was one some of the assignments
6/23/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 😑thanks ruben
6/23/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I think
6/23/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ur saying that 2^n = 3^n
6/23/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Watch the difference between big Oh and Theta
6/23/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Yeah i still dont get it, and its subset
6/23/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 3 is a lot bigger than 2 and a function that is at most 2 is in the subset of functions that grow as fast as 3
6/23/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Or am i thinking wrong
6/23/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Bit the right one is Theta
6/23/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: It works when they are both O but why not when 3 is theta
6/23/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Theta means that it is also lowerbounded
6/23/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Is it becuz the lower bound
6/23/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Yess
6/23/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Hm okay
6/23/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thanks
6/24/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: For modeling is chapter 7 not on exam? Becuz havent seen questions from it in past exams
6/24/17, 21:36 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: There were questions about chapter 7 in the 2016 exam I believe
6/24/17, 21:36 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oh okay
6/24/17, 21:36 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thanx
6/24/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Not 100% though, but I believe there was something on Surprise and Genericity and stuf
6/24/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: In case you didn't know btw, the resit is only multiple choice
6/24/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Yeah i know about that
6/24/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: We need 20 questions correct to pass ?
6/24/17, 21:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes
6/25/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: are there any other modeling past exams except the ones in cs students?
6/25/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 37275258‬: no that i know of, but you could also make the quizzes on on-course
6/25/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: For those who will be introparents this intro, we received an email on friday. For the both of us the email was placed into the spam folder so if you haven't seen it yet, it might be a good idea to look there.

6/25/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Did anyone make the statistical data analysis example exam already?
6/25/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: And is pretty sure the answers are mainly correct
6/25/17, 14:13 - ‪+30 697 453 5573‬: Some of the exercises in the exam are from the study guide
6/25/17, 14:13 - ‪+30 697 453 5573‬: You can find the answers there
6/25/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh okay thanks I'll have a look at that
6/25/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
6/25/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Just testing whether rewriting f(x,y) = constant for all of the given constants gives the equation for the circle
6/25/17, 21:12 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Ah, thanks!
6/25/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Isil the answer is C right?
6/25/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Ow I meant D
6/25/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 😏
6/25/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: d
6/25/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Shut it
6/25/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah D is the right answer sander
6/25/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Nice got it thanks @31610720282 @31621606619
6/25/17, 22:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: It is D
6/25/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Do we always say =1
6/25/17, 22:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Dear peoples,
as you all know hopefully the 3rd we have our USE test. Some people have asked if everyone could upload their (correct) answers because there is a high chance that the questions will be reused on our exam. We have created folders on cs-students.nl under the USE basis folder there are folder for every weekly tests. If you could be so kind to upload your answers there that would be great! Then we can put together a pdf containing of all the questions that were asked and we can learn them. I would be nice if a few people would help us with sorting all the questions so that we can delete duplicates and create a file with no duplicates. If you would like to help with that please send me a personal message (we'll probably need quite some people and even an hour of work can help a lot already + you'll be learning already ;D)  and I'll throw you into a groupschat from where we can coordinate everything!
6/25/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Really great idea
6/25/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Great Idea! I'll upload mine! 👍🏻
6/25/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But with making the pdf
6/25/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Do it in such a way that the answer is not immediatly visible
6/25/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So people can practice
6/25/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: A link to the actual page:
https://cs-students.nl/display/SOF/USE+Weekly+Tests+Answers
6/25/17, 22:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Good idea but that would probably take quite a bit of time ;D If there's enough time to do so after collection all questions and people are willing to help we could try but collecting is the first step!
6/25/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: What format do you want? Png?
6/25/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Indeed
6/25/17, 22:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: PNG would be nice yes! I just found out that I haven't turned on file uploading yet
6/25/17, 22:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So give me a second ;D
6/25/17, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Fixed
6/25/17, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You should now be able to upload files just fine ;)
6/25/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'll upload mine tomorrow 😘
6/25/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Again great idea Ruben!
6/25/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: As I said not really my idea ;) But you had a great idea
6/25/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Again, great ass Ruben!
6/25/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I love it
6/25/17, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ty! Takes a lot of hard work and dedication

6/26/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: both partial derivatives I get, the -Pi and 1+ (- Pi) as well
6/26/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Look up the formula for linearizations
6/26/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The 0 is not needed, but ommitting it causes onCourse to freak out
6/26/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, if you replace the brackets, it seems a lot more logical
6/26/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: will check out that formula, thanks
6/26/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This is also given on the test btw
6/26/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>

6/26/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: does anyone know where the statistical data analysis is? my timetable doesnt show it anymore
6/26/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: test is?*
6/26/17, 11:04 - ‪+30 697 453 5573‬: In aud 12,13,14

6/26/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Kun je pinnen op tu campus parkeerplaats?
6/26/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Metaforum
6/26/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: binnenkomsthal tegenover infobalie
6/26/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ja in de parkeerplaats tegenover de infobalie
6/26/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: daan idioot
6/26/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Top
6/26/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 😂
6/26/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ja, bij de automaten kan je ook pinnen
6/26/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Alleen munten toch zo'n parkeerautomaat?
6/26/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Volgens mij niet
6/26/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Briefjes ook iig
6/26/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: En ik dacht ook pinnen
6/26/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nee je kan pinnen
6/26/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Nice thx
6/26/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Wel fucking duur though
6/26/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: De beste optie is om te parkeren aan de onze lieve vrouwestraat, dat is noordelijk van het sportcentrum
6/26/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is ongeveer 10 mins lopen naar MetaForum, maar wel gratis
6/26/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Of als je meer dan 12 dagen per jaar op de uni staat een parkeerkaart halen
6/26/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Die heb je er dan al uit namelijk
6/26/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: En zo'n ding kost 100 euro..
6/26/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 50 cent per uur toch
6/26/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wow ik las slecht
6/26/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 38558225‬: <Media omitted>
6/26/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ajoh gooi je auto gewoon bij MF neer, briefje op je ruit dat je even pinnen bent bij MF en in 10 minuutjes terug bent
6/26/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Krijgt sowieso altijd eerst een waarschuwing daar
6/26/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Meer vgm, ik was eerder al snel 7.5 per dag kwijt als i k't goed herinner
6/26/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I have no idea, no one can answer these clearly
6/26/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's just an educated guess
6/26/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Imagine unit of x and y is t
6/26/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: T square divided by t is t
6/26/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: And thats the same as t+t
6/26/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 38558225‬: Sorry, i still dont get it :x
6/26/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: also they forgot to place brackets there
6/26/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Je kunt pinnen en is idd 7.50 per dag
6/26/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 38558225‬: Oh well i guess its up to rng
6/26/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 38558225‬: Thanks for the help
6/26/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: _Just putting this out there again in case people missed it._

Dear peoples,
as you all know hopefully the 3rd we have our USE test. Some people have asked if everyone could upload their (correct) answers because there is a high chance that the questions will be reused on our exam. We have created folders on cs-students.nl under the USE basis folder there are folder for every weekly tests. If you could be so kind to upload your answers there that would be great! Then we can put together a pdf containing of all the questions that were asked and we can learn them. I would be nice if a few people would help us with sorting all the questions so that we can delete duplicates and create a file with no duplicates. If you would like to help with that please join the group mentioned below (we'll probably need quite some people and even an hour of work can help a lot already + you'll be learning already ;D)  and I'll throw you into a groupschat from where we can coordinate everything! Upload your questions in png format to the site please!

6/26/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Wow great idea! I'll join Ruben
6/26/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I can join starting tomorrow
6/26/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: same
6/26/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: What is the location for modelling resit?
6/26/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Devil's Den
6/26/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
6/26/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Thank you
6/26/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
6/26/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The stepsize for y is -1
6/26/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: In your answers it is -2
6/26/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: To get from -2 to -1 you devide by 2
6/26/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And then you get (-.5, -1)
6/26/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oki thanjs
6/26/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Which course is this from?
6/26/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Modeling
6/26/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Oh damn never learned that
6/26/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: how do you guys study for the automata test?
6/26/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No clue yet
6/26/17, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Waiting for someone to figure that out
6/26/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Practicing faking my own death so everyone passes
6/26/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ahh thanks!
6/26/17, 18:47 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: MVP
6/26/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: How are you guys studying for the USE test?
6/26/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: btw, made all recommended exercises again, wrote down all proofs in my own language and made exams from previous years by erik
6/26/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: should be enough
6/26/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Reading summary I made and probably the ones that are online, maybe some book passages. Best is probably to practice with the questions we have of quizzes and example exam.
6/26/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: <Media omitted>
6/26/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yup
6/26/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: For most of these proofs they will probably guide you in the right direction if they're asking you to proof them
6/26/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You do not have to be able for the longer proofs to do them fully from scratch
6/26/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: shit really? because im learning all by heart atm
6/26/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: R u god
6/26/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no, I'm slowly going mad overtime
6/27/17, 10:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Modelling resit is out in oncourse

6/27/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Do you feel like sharing this summary? or is it on paper
6/27/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It is handwritten...

6/27/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Try to find questions with weird, wrong or ambiguous answers
6/27/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Get 1 question to be declared free and you passed
6/27/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, I am exactly going to do that :P
6/27/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: @31642623926 they still might pass you
6/27/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Last test that happened with multiple questions iirc
6/27/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: When the exam is posted online, I will inspect it with some other people
6/27/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Happened with a 4.9
6/27/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wait, how?
6/27/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Marc had a 4.8 too for the first one and suddenly had a 5
6/27/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Right @31614599419 ?
6/27/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Not a 5
6/27/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Still 4,9 but got 5 studypoints
6/27/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm, interesting
6/27/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: So they passed him with that grade
6/27/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Don't be a dick and name him tho :p
6/27/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: To your instructor
6/27/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ahh, I'll just go to the inspection then :P
6/27/17, 10:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Rick try the question 2
6/27/17, 10:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: It asked for the model in video lectures
6/27/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: That was such a bullshit question
6/27/17, 10:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its a shit question asking you to remember deatailes about a model in a video
6/27/17, 10:36 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬: Wait how do you guys know your grade
6/27/17, 10:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oncourse
6/27/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i cant believe they bothered to change every single question
6/27/17, 10:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Grades
6/27/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: for this shitty subject
6/27/17, 10:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes😵
6/27/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, I am going to complain about that one certainly
6/27/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: 6.5 nice
6/27/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I like it
6/27/17, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: glad u liek it
6/27/17, 10:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Like come on the lecturer is dead give him some rest
6/27/17, 10:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😬
6/27/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Also @31642623926 you could complain about the pair of sock question. I found it very unclear you could assume a 'pair' would be together at all times or both of the socks could be at different places and still be a pair
6/27/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: omg yeah
6/27/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: what an asshole
6/27/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: question
6/27/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: To be fair the 18 options for one sock was easy, and then the addition of "pair" was just square it
6/27/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But you can always try :)
6/27/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah okay but if a pair means they are always together it would be less states than 18 squared
6/27/17, 10:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think i did 18 because isnt a pair of socks allways togheter ?
6/27/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i didnt pay attention to that and marked 18 first and i noticed it second time checking the test
6/27/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: but it was for a sock
6/27/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: only
6/27/17, 10:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😐ok nevermind got my 5 i want to cry
6/27/17, 10:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: The more i cgeck the more i get crippled
6/27/17, 10:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😄
6/27/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Passed or not?
6/27/17, 10:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Pass
6/27/17, 10:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Considering thats a passing grade for the final
6/27/17, 10:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Final >=5
6/27/17, 10:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So i pass course with 7.16
6/27/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 7.6 👍🏻 8 it is haha
6/27/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/27/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Dude this early pizza? Enjoy lol

6/27/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: if this is question 3 of 2012, just apply the masters theorem
6/27/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: they ask you to apply the master theorem on your answer
6/27/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: I dont know how to get the answer in the firs place 😂

6/27/17, 16:47 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Wait, not all chapters will be asked for final?
6/27/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Ch 5 of ethics won't

6/27/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Is there some lemma saying that or sth ?
6/27/17, 20:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, for use exam
Every question counts 1 point and to get 5.5 it's required to get 41 points, did I get it right?
I just remember seeing something like that in chat
6/27/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Yep its true
6/27/17, 20:18 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I wish all first 40 questions will come from quizzes ahahah

6/27/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Or is a 5.0 also enough if your total grade is a 5.5 or higher?
6/27/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: im kinda assuming that 5.0 is enough since thats always the case
6/27/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but check study guide if you wanne be sure i guess
6/27/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: Where did you guys find that chapter 5 is not on the exam from use?
6/27/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: <Media omitted>
6/27/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: Since the study guide says chapter 5 will be on exam
6/27/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: n
6/27/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Check the readingguide of textbook ethics on canvas
6/27/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: Huh but the study guide says chapter 5 will be on exam, but the reading guide says it won't ???
6/27/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Hmm that's confusing indeed 🤔
6/27/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: hmm, just to be on the safe side I'd skip it
6/27/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So you won't have trouble on the exam
6/27/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Solid advice😂
6/27/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: better to spend your precious time on anything productive to the development of the human race contrary to the inbred mass of incompetent loathsome repulsiveness designed by a nefarious example of genetic deficiency that we call USE

6/28/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thought this'd be a weirdly high mark again
6/28/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Daan vieze tryhard

6/28/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: We get 7.8
6/28/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No don't get me wrong, I am happy about the grade. I just thought it'd be higher because I put in more effort for this one
6/28/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: USE part B you mean? My grade isn't online yet :/

6/28/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Does anyone remember what the questions were?
6/28/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Osiris -> progress -> qualification request
6/28/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You need to run either BFS / DFS and then tell what the forward edges were if I remember correctly
6/28/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Thankss
6/28/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I cannot do this for some reason, even though I've passed everything up until now.
6/28/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Alright thank you
6/28/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Is this normal? Or is this a bug
6/28/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Because in my planapp it also says that i didnt pass CG in Q2, even though i passed the resit
6/28/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Should I mail someone about it? Or are you not supposed to be able to register for the P-exam yet
6/28/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I already did it
6/28/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
6/28/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'll send an email out
6/28/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: So maybe mail CG people
6/28/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guess i should mail roel?
6/28/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hmm idk
6/28/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i think its a mistake in osiris though
6/28/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: To correct your final grade if that isn't done yet
6/28/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: since in my results tab it shows the correct grade
6/28/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it has been corrected
6/28/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: But also final average? With ECTS
6/28/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: uhh
6/28/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lemme check
6/28/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Are there any more exams for use from previous years somewhere?
6/28/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Protagoras, but they have a lot of queastions that aren't relevant to us
6/28/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: We are working on something
6/28/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Ah, thanks!
6/28/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it doesnt show my 5 ECTS
6/28/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: We got the 2015 exam
6/28/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: while in my results tab it says i got an 8 for the course
6/28/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Including answers
6/28/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: rip
6/28/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the P-exam file doesnt show my 45 ECTS
6/28/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: nerd
6/28/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: who should i mail?
6/28/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: studycouncelorsfs@tue.nl
6/28/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Osiris doesn't show ECTS, was confused with oase, but if it shows your average correctly then you should mail Bloo
6/28/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this is wrong though
6/28/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Osiris shows ECTS if you look at "current progress"
6/28/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: imma mail bloo
6/28/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: c.j.bloo@tue.nl?
6/28/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: im guessing
6/28/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: ↑
6/28/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This
6/28/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight
6/28/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because then Yves can also respond
6/28/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: r.bloo@fontys.nl toch?
6/28/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
6/28/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what should i say, just like
6/28/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk
6/28/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i passed but didnt get my credits
6/28/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: max, resits are not yet on there
6/28/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: they are in results though
6/28/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or did you pass Q1 -Q3 everything
6/28/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i did
6/28/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: passed the resit in q3
6/28/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: which
6/28/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: CG
6/28/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it shows the new grade in results?
6/28/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yup
6/28/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: does it also show your new course grade?
6/28/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: iin results
6/28/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yup
6/28/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: but in the voortgang tab
6/28/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it does not show my 5 credits in the progress tab
6/28/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: press your major + propedeuse bachelor
6/28/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooh
6/28/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hmm
6/28/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: so the 5 is still between bracketts for CS?
6/28/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: mail osiris@tue.nl
6/28/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hang on where am i supposed to look?
6/28/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah i checked there
6/28/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it doesnt even show CG on there
6/28/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its nowhere to be found
6/28/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Mail them haha
6/28/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yea i will lol
6/28/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: should i mail osiris devs instead of roel maybe?
6/28/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: might be a problem they can solve
6/28/17, 12:34 - Kevin Jilissen: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Rounded I think
6/28/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Try both
6/28/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight
6/28/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Or maybe student administration
6/28/17, 12:37 - Kevin Jilissen: Damn, then I need 3 times a 6 this quartile 🤔
6/28/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: For the P-enrollment, one would want the examination date 31-aug-17, yes?
6/28/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You can try summa cum laude if you want, but it will not show up on your certificates
6/28/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yes
6/28/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That will work
6/28/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Thanks!
6/28/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: And for the actual handing out? It says you need to specify but there arent any dates for it
6/28/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That is in the kick off slides
6/28/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Okay thanks again
6/28/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: October 9th or something
6/28/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: how do you guys learn for automata?
6/28/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: i dont really know where to start
6/28/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Do the proofs
6/28/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: The rest should come naturally
6/28/17, 13:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 13:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can someone briedfly explain whats going on here
6/28/17, 13:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: we get the the index of the median fine
6/28/17, 13:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: then we compare both medians from the two arrays
6/28/17, 13:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: why do we return a if they are equal
6/28/17, 13:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can we also return b?
6/28/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Yes
6/28/17, 13:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: it should be ma not am right ?
6/28/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If the two are equal then one of the two is also the medin in the combined array
6/28/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: And indeed it should say Ma and not Am
6/28/17, 13:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ok
6/28/17, 13:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what happens after
6/28/17, 13:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: if its small
6/28/17, 13:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: we can median on the bottom one
6/28/17, 13:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: if b is bigger
6/28/17, 13:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: we call findmedian on the bogger
6/28/17, 13:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I cant type like a hooma
6/28/17, 13:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: human
6/28/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If Ma is smaller than Mb then we can only say that the combined median is between those 2
6/28/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: So we recall the algorithm to find it
6/28/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: But now we search from Ma to Mb
6/28/17, 13:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oh so in the center
6/28/17, 13:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but if A ma is bigger than Bmb then what do we do
6/28/17, 13:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: why do we searh the two that are outter
6/28/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Because the median of A is bigger than the one in B so the combined median is at the left handside of Ma or at the right handside of Mb
6/28/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: At DS starts the index on 0 or 1?
6/28/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Sorry if im unclear find it pretty difficult to explain
6/28/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Depends normally at 1 though
6/28/17, 13:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: normal on 1
6/28/17, 13:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but thanks I think I got it
6/28/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because they like to be different
6/28/17, 13:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yeah :D
6/28/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If the load factor goes to 1 then we should use chaining right?
6/28/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Anything above 0.8 already afaik
6/28/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ye
6/28/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Because in the answer file it says: assignment 5 but those are different
6/28/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: And I'd like to know if I'm correct
6/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: It's yes no yes I reckon
6/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: When it's about subtrees it's almost always yes and when it's about ancestors its no
6/28/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah yes, no, yes
6/28/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: No, yes no yes. Oh no, it's yes no yes, yes.
6/28/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: But in the second case it is only dependent on it's parent right? Because every node's distance is just: distance [x] = distance [x.parent] + 1
6/28/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Or am I wrong
6/28/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: use an inOrderTreeWalk
6/28/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah but that the parents nodes distance also depends on that. Now if you take away the root of the tree all nodes have to be updated which will take n-1 = O(n) time and thus you're fucked
6/28/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh okay I get it thanks
6/28/17, 14:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: does anyone have a decent explaination of this
6/28/17, 14:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 14:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: the one in the answers folder looks very strange to me
6/28/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is there only 1 sample exam we can do for use?
6/28/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: inOrderTreeWalk, it's mentioned in the slides somwhere
6/28/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: and then only report the odd keys instead of all of em
6/28/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Dimitar look up like 5 messages
6/28/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Han just answered it like 5 messages ago
6/28/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: its not the full answer tho is it
6/28/17, 14:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I need to do the in in order tree walk before
6/28/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Can someone explain the proof of lemma 3.15 B for me? It says induction on K and then do it like in A, but do not understand it
6/28/17, 14:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: nevermmind I got it
6/28/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thank u
6/28/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: This indeed?
6/28/17, 15:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 15:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what happens on b and is c correct and how do I make it proper
6/28/17, 15:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :{
6/28/17, 15:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: avois clustering ?
6/28/17, 15:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: do I have to explain why?
6/28/17, 15:10 - Luke Houben: Chaining because the loadfactor is really high
6/28/17, 15:11 - Luke Houben: And thus open addressing can take a long time if primary clustering occurs
6/28/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: For c quadratric probing while is a simpler computation, it can result in secondary clustering, double hashing with an appropriate hashing function can get you closer to uniform distribution
6/28/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: The problem you get if you use open addressing for b is that the load factor is just 2 elements away from being one
6/28/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 14539157‬: So eventually, if you want to add 2 new elements to the table you'll fill it up
6/28/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Does anyone remember if there was a cheat sheet for data structures? And if so, what's on there?
6/28/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I don't  recall having a cheat sheet but I'm not totally sure
6/28/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Don't think so
6/28/17, 16:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: no cheat just shit
6/28/17, 16:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: no cheatshit
6/28/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Studyhub 2 right?
6/28/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Alright thx guys
6/28/17, 16:42 - Luke Houben: Yeah adriano, b&c iirc
6/28/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Thanks
6/28/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Becuz its not correct
6/28/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Im confused it says its false in example exam answers
6/28/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: lowerbounded by 2^n is not lowerbounded by 3^n, it's all about the lowerbound
6/28/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: But its correct when its upper bound
6/28/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Both are upper bound
6/28/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Right
6/28/17, 17:25 - Bas Gieling: no its the lower bound
6/28/17, 17:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I thin if it was upper bound it would be correct if thats what you are asking
6/28/17, 17:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But here its lower so no
6/28/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Okay
6/28/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: It basically says if something is bigger than 2^n is it also bigger than 3^n?
6/28/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: This does not hold for all numberz
6/28/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: So its false
6/28/17, 20:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Soo what do you guys thing of ds resit
6/28/17, 20:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I saw hakan did the smart thing
6/28/17, 20:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31614418848
6/28/17, 20:42 - Luke Houben: Wasn't that bad imo
6/28/17, 20:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I am 99% sure i fail
6/28/17, 20:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Which means vettina is 10000% sure i fail
6/28/17, 20:43 - Luke Houben: 3 algorithm questions tho
6/28/17, 20:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah fuck this
6/28/17, 20:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And again ... almost nothing like previous exams
6/28/17, 20:43 - Luke Houben: Way harder hash table question, but not impossible
6/28/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So don't fail the first one
6/28/17, 20:43 - Luke Houben: Nope indeed
6/28/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: What were the correct ones at question 1
6/28/17, 20:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Wow sander i am not sure if you are sassy or didnt understand my statement but for both cases your answer is weird
6/28/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Dude I am just kidding😂
6/28/17, 20:44 - Luke Houben: I had 1 2 4 5
6/28/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: 😂😂
6/28/17, 20:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: First and last are ok
6/28/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I also had 1 2 4 5
6/28/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Going to look at Dank memes now , thats the only thing that can make my life better now
6/28/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I had first and third correct, fuck this
6/28/17, 20:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Are we sure about the omega
6/28/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: What was 2?
6/28/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: From 1
6/28/17, 20:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I had 12 45 but decided to remove 4
6/28/17, 20:45 - Luke Houben: No 4 i think
6/28/17, 20:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its the log one
6/28/17, 20:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah 4 is omaga
6/28/17, 20:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Omega
6/28/17, 20:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And its true for O
6/28/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I definitely had 145 but can't remember what 2 was
6/28/17, 20:45 - Luke Houben: Yeah i was also in doubt of that one but when i usually change an answer i get it wrong so i left it
6/28/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But i think I had that ine
6/28/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: One
6/28/17, 20:46 - Luke Houben: 2 was n log^2 n = O (n log n^2)
6/28/17, 20:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What about the augmentation
6/28/17, 20:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah thats fine
6/28/17, 20:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Isnt it
6/28/17, 20:46 - Luke Houben: Yeah i think so
6/28/17, 20:46 - Luke Houben: No expert tho
6/28/17, 20:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: On augmentation i had a and b fine but c not fine
6/28/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yeah me too
6/28/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Me too dimitar and thats 100% true
6/28/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But im now wondering if I marked 2🤔
6/28/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I really can't remember
6/28/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: Isn't 2 wrong? Cuz nlog(n^2)=2nlogn right?
6/28/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: Which grows slower than nlog^2n
6/28/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Dont ruin it now ffs Leon 😂
6/28/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: Lol I'm sorry guys XD
6/28/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Nice Leon, I like your thinking
6/28/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: But probably yeah
6/28/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Perhaps thats why I can't remember marking it. Because I didnt
6/28/17, 20:56 - Luke Houben: Does n log n grow slower than n log log n?
6/28/17, 20:56 - Kevin Jilissen: 2*n*log(n) grows faster as n*log^2(n)
6/28/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yes
6/28/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I was doubting that lol but messed it up then I guess
6/28/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Kevin doesnt agree lol
6/28/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: No it doesnt kevin
6/28/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: N grows slower than nlogn
6/28/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: So nlogn grows slower than nlognlogn
6/28/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: That was my thoughts
6/28/17, 20:59 - Kevin Jilissen: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: Is not log(logx)) tho
6/28/17, 20:59 - Luke Houben: God
6/28/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Its not loglogn
6/28/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: Is logn*logn
6/28/17, 21:00 - Kevin Jilissen: log^2(n) = log(log(n))
6/28/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Its logx times logx
6/28/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: No
6/28/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Really
6/28/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: If thats true my whole life was a lie
6/28/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Its not
6/28/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Fake facts from Kevin
6/28/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: Nono log^2(n)=logn*logn
6/28/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: She literally tried to put hardest questions
6/28/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: It wasnt as easy
6/28/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Cause we are all the smartest 😉
6/28/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Finding the k biggest was pretty easy though
6/28/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I couldnt do it in the time apecified
6/28/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Specified
6/28/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Build max heap O(n), extract max k times = k log k
6/28/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oh wow
6/28/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I never thought of that
6/28/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I did it in O (kn)
6/28/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Im soo not creative
6/28/17, 21:02 - Kevin Jilissen: My bad
6/28/17, 21:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: No ... we are just human
6/28/17, 21:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And bettina is german
6/28/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I had it right ?
6/28/17, 21:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How did you do ?
6/28/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Pretty well
6/28/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: What were ur answers for 1?
6/28/17, 21:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I saw you run from the room 30 min in... not sure what to think
6/28/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I was 55 minutes in
6/28/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: ExtractMax is log(n) right? So it would be k log n, at least that's what I thought
6/28/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: I may have been a little creative with the running times of that
6/28/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yes thats what I thought as well han
6/28/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I had the same idea at first but erased it because it would be k log n
6/28/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Whoops should've built a max-heap with k elements
6/28/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: That would've worked though, just a small difference
6/28/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Lol
6/28/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Was the one with log correct or false
6/28/17, 21:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: False i think
6/28/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: False
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Good
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Maybe you get some points tho Thomas
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I had 3 true 2 false
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So is it 1 and 5 ?
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And 4?
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: 4/5 would be fine
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: 1,4,5 true
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Was for
Me
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I thought only 1 and 5 is corrext
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I did 125
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Why is 4 lower bounded
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: What was 4
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬ left
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 4 is not correct for lower bound
6/28/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Its supposed to be upper bound n cube
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes correct
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I had 145 as well
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Wow i mught 3 my dude
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I had 4 correct
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Maybe 4.5
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: It was correct
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: What was 4 again?
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: No its not gankan
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Sum sum
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: The 2 summations
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: It was lower bound
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Double sum
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Its not supposed to be lower it doesnt make sense
6/28/17, 21:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thats correct for O but not for omega
6/28/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: What do you mean by double sum?
6/28/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I really have a bad case of alzheimers lol
6/28/17, 21:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sum from 1 to n of sum from 0 to j of 1
6/28/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Oh yes
6/28/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: It was correct right?
6/28/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oh wait
6/28/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Incorrect*
6/28/17, 21:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: No...
6/28/17, 21:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thats right i think its wrong for lower bound
6/28/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Then I dont know what I marked
6/28/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But Def 1 and 5
6/28/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Not sure about the rest any more
6/28/17, 21:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Me neither
6/28/17, 21:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh well tume to die
6/28/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Whatdid u have at excercise 2
6/28/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Let it go
6/28/17, 21:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🙏🏿
6/28/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Prob got grades tomorrow
6/28/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Worst case with N, average case with n/m?
6/28/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This, yes
6/28/17, 21:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How the fuck does she do it ? ??
6/28/17, 21:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Does she use nigerian slaves ?
6/28/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I think ethiopian
6/28/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ones
6/28/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I talked with Arthur about it: The entire algorithms group of TU/e and a few student assistants work on it from 8 am to 11 pm
6/28/17, 21:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Seriously fuck her right in the nazi fat ass
6/28/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Dimitar, don't get mad at her because you failed the exam
6/28/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: She is (one of) the best teacher(s) this university has
6/28/17, 21:11 - Luke Houben: ^
6/28/17, 21:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hello mein fuhrer wir werden der resit complex machen
6/28/17, 21:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sieg heile
6/28/17, 21:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: No i agree she is a good lecturer
6/28/17, 21:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But why does she make her exams cancer for no reason
6/28/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: What did you guys have for data structure at 10?
6/28/17, 21:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hahaha nice one my dude
6/28/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I had a "fuck-this-shit moment
6/28/17, 21:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ruben you too ?
6/28/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: At the last question yes
6/28/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Other we're really doable I thought
6/28/17, 21:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I thought you were genius
6/28/17, 21:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Why resit ?
6/28/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The two algo's where straight copies from the assignments
6/28/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I had rb tree at 10
6/28/17, 21:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Me too
6/28/17, 21:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And insertion
6/28/17, 21:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Is O log n
6/28/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: With the even and odd sums as extra fields
6/28/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Me too adriano
6/28/17, 21:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Why didnt i think of that...
6/28/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Exactly that
6/28/17, 21:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh well
6/28/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Explanation included and done lol
6/28/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I scratched that after writing that
6/28/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Kill. Me
6/28/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And then for the algo insert a and then use the extra fields
6/28/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 👆🏼
6/28/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And then I for got to remove it 😭
6/28/17, 21:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok bye
6/28/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Hahaha that scks

6/28/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I hope
6/28/17, 21:17 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 10 was also similar to sumbetween exercise in assignment
6/28/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I felt so smart when I realised I could have the sums as extra fields
6/28/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Lol
6/28/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: The only time I have felt smart this year
6/28/17, 21:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: The only time i felt smart was when i got complimented by a tutor in  computer systems for bringing back the wire box to the shelve
6/28/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: It was probably more a feeling of appreciated, did he say good boy?
6/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: He said very nice. Thats how intelligent engineers behave
6/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Maybe he thought you were a nice doge
6/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Where is your mom anyway?
6/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😊
6/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But on a side note...  he probably did
6/28/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yeah ditched her
6/28/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Too many people were asking dumb questions. Including my family lol
6/28/17, 21:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Aylemayo
6/28/17, 21:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: K bye i am looking for a noose
6/28/17, 21:37 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, could someone please explain how final exam for use is gonna be graded
I still don't quite get it
6/28/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 39/60 = 6
6/28/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 41/60 = 5.5
6/28/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: = 5***
6/28/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Not 6 but 5
6/28/17, 21:38 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: How does this work? Do they have a graph for grades translation or so? Or some questions cost different amount of points?
6/28/17, 21:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 21:39 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: The ones they remove are they consider full points or do they just lower the number of questions? Since last year they removed like 6 question
6/28/17, 21:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, my pretty reliable source said that questions are re-used a lot
6/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And we got the 2014 exam, so study that pretty well
6/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or like really well
6/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Pretty really well ?
6/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 2014 or 2015?
6/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes.
6/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Does this mean that most of the quiz questions will appear in first part of the exam?
6/28/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm, 2015, I'm sorry
6/28/17, 21:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Rick could you share it?
6/28/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: We are working on it! The weeklies are almost LaTeXed, and then we will start on the exam
6/28/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So expect it tomorrow before the afternoon
6/28/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You mean you are creating an exam consisting of all weekly questions there are?
6/28/17, 21:43 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: That's awesome, thanks!
6/28/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes
6/28/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Great
6/28/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: One more question
6/28/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I've advertised it several times in this group lol
6/28/17, 21:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: We are both creating an exam of all weeklies and converting an old exam to LaTeX
6/28/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If you have the exam of 2015 why do you need to latex it?
6/28/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Isn't it already pdf?
6/28/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because it is only pictures
6/28/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Oooh
6/28/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Nice
6/28/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: -Latex everything
6/28/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Rick bæ
6/28/17, 21:44 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: By the way there were people arguing whether it's chapter 4 or 5 not needed for exam 
Reread ethics support for exam provided on canvas
Seems like both chapters 4 and 5 are not needed for exam
6/28/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 😘
6/28/17, 21:44 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: By the way, check this one out
It says which topics will be in the exam
6/28/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It's the same as data struggles, and someone got pictures of both the exam and the answer key
6/28/17, 21:45 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's called reading guide textbook ethics
6/28/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, btw, about the USE exam of 2015, it is dutch only tho
6/28/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I'm sorry about that
6/28/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Rip most people
6/28/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I don't mind
6/28/17, 21:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But we might translate it
6/28/17, 21:51 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Isn't it possible to translate? I might want to give it a try if no one wants
6/28/17, 21:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: We are going to translate, but a grammar nazi would be nice!
6/28/17, 21:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well the more people help the better the translation will become probably
6/28/17, 21:52 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Okay, you working in this group?
6/28/17, 21:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yup!
6/28/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
6/28/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: So the second one was wrong
6/28/17, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oh yeah i will upload my questions tooo
6/28/17, 23:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Me too
6/28/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: how was there confusion about this?
6/28/17, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Here
6/29/17, 00:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No but i mean isnt that kinda obvious?
6/29/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: since its a square
6/29/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Sry stef we r not as smart
6/29/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and the moment that log(x) gets bigger than 1, you know that its faster
6/29/17, 00:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and since ur always looking at significantly large numbers, thats ur answer
6/29/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: can anyone tell me what the exact chapters are that we have to learn for ethics?
6/29/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: there are two possibilities for this
6/29/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: either you follow the slides of the final lecture
6/29/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or you follow the studyguide
6/29/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: When do we get data structures resit
6/29/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
6/29/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: this is according to the lectures
6/29/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: ah thanks
6/29/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
6/29/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and this is according to the study guide
6/29/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so basically the big diff is chapter 5 yes or no
6/29/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no one is really sure about it
6/29/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: if you have spare time, do 5 anyway to be sure
6/29/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I would go for the study guide, that shit is binding, slides aren't
6/29/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its the ethical cycle, its not long or difficult anyway
6/29/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so yeah i agree with maas
6/29/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: just read over the summary of chapter 5 and you will probably be fine
6/29/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its basically the topics of the assignment
6/29/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: hasn't anyone sent an e-mail about this?
6/29/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nop
6/29/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not that im aware of
6/29/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but its literally one A4 page consisting of explaination of the topics that you had to do for the assignment
6/29/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so i guess it shouldnt even be needed to study it
6/29/17, 11:41 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You don't need chapter file
6/29/17, 11:41 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Five *
6/29/17, 11:41 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: reading guide textbook ethics
6/29/17, 11:41 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Check this one
6/29/17, 11:42 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's says every topic that has to be learnt
6/29/17, 11:42 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: And specifically mentioned that chapter 5 is only needed for online quiz
6/29/17, 11:42 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: But not the exam
6/29/17, 11:42 - Bart van Dooren: Also in the guide for the ethics books it says chapter 5 for assigment+ quizzes
6/29/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: I sent an email to the USE lecturers asking them to re-open the quizzes so we can use them for studying. Hopefully they are willing to do that
6/29/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Should've asked whether chapter 5 was in there as well
6/29/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It isn't 👍🏻
6/29/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 👍🏻
6/29/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys don't reserve rooms in Matrix they're all empty
6/29/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Like no bureau's etc left
6/29/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
6/29/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Are ds grades online yet?

6/29/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: No
6/29/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's been like 16.75 hours
6/29/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I don't think they'll be online today
6/29/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's nothing like Arthur and Bettina
6/29/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They should've been uploaded already
6/29/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yeah thats what I thought
6/29/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
6/29/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I probably have a 3 but you know, I get to see my 3 onlin
6/29/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Online
6/29/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's your right as a failure

6/29/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The "Students' Grand Challenge" is complete! A crew of awesome people compiled the weekly tests and the 2015 exam into one practice exam. It misses 13 questions of the exam, which will come tomorrow, and it might also contain some slight grammar-, spelling and typing errors, but it is pretty fucking awesome!
6/29/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
6/29/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Awesome it is
6/29/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It will also be uploaded to cs-students.nl for future reference

6/29/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Does it only include all weeklies or also all other exam questions?
6/29/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exam from 2015
6/29/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: All weekly questions from the pool to the extend that we could not find any new ones for every week
6/29/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exam from 2016 should be on CS-students.nl already if I'm not mistaken
6/29/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yes Nice
6/29/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thanks

6/29/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: do we need to know all the case studies in the ethics book?
6/29/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The slides say don't study specific cases
6/29/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But the questions are asked about specific cases
6/29/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So they'd say no
6/29/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But they act like YES
6/29/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: (goddamn women)
6/29/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So try to look through all of them Jort
6/29/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Don't study them by heart, just make sure you know what they are about
6/29/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That is just too much, some cases in the questions are just mentioned in 1 sentence
6/29/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Or a few sentences
6/29/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then why do they ask about them :(
6/29/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Because you shouldn't know the cases by heart, but you should know what they stand for. Which is just stupid
6/29/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: then I'll just be sure and not learn them
6/29/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: in the ethics guide it appearently says which ones you should know
6/29/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is good intel
6/29/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: someone told me but i have not checked it out myself
6/29/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It does indeed
6/29/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well considering my most reliable source just confirmed I am convinced
6/29/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: Can I send it to people from other studies? Or do you legends have a problem with that?
6/29/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Go ahead
6/29/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: Thanks!
6/29/17, 20:20 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: how did you get the exam of 2015?
6/29/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's classified
6/29/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Door plagiaat
6/29/17, 20:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sources that definitely shouldn't have given it to me :p
6/29/17, 20:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Classified it is
6/29/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Why didn't they want to give it?
6/29/17, 20:39 - Kevin Jilissen: Maybe they wanted to reuse it? 🤔
Would be nice
6/29/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah that'd be great
6/29/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That'd be fucking grant
6/29/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Study that shit by heart
6/29/17, 20:42 - Kevin Jilissen: (I have no idea, it just would be great)
6/29/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Can someone tell Bettina she gets a free Bratwurst if she releases the grades today?
6/29/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
6/29/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: A very big bratwurst, winkwink
6/29/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What happened with your app today man?
6/29/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Biggest fuckups in the history of fuckups
6/29/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Upping it to a currywurst might help
6/29/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: They are re-using the tests, yeah
6/29/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Makes this even better
6/29/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: please, have you ever seen my sorting machine
6/29/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: which is actually a really awesome thing
6/29/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No no
6/29/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: This man
6/29/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We didn't make it accurate
6/29/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: This app had like 1 working feature, and even that was fucked up by my groupmates
6/29/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Put his app to test
6/29/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Said nothing as if it was working fine
6/29/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 10 min after testing buttons and nothing happening
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah we didn't implement anything😂
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It was great
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: LOL
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: I thought there was at least something working because we had that working in our master version
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What did paul say lol
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: lmaoooooo
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: But apparently it was too hard for my groupmates to implement a simple change without fucking everything up
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hmm that really sucks
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: So it was just a majestic shit show
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah it was😂
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: How did Paul react?
6/29/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Paul wasn't there
6/29/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Was that woman called Natasha?
6/29/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh yeah
6/29/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What did she say then lol
6/29/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: I knew it was going to be bad, but I was shocked that it was worse than I thought
6/29/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Well she just said they had to do it again
6/29/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hand it in in summer
6/29/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Yeah I've been kind of roasting them today because they fucked up horrifically
6/29/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Everything that did work, I've implemented myself and they just broke it last-minute
6/29/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That's horrible
6/29/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: It used to be so that only the week-program was non-functional, which is really bad but we could've survived that if the rest was okay
6/29/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
6/29/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: My condolances
6/29/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But what did the last night test tell you?
6/29/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did it work then?
6/29/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Last night I was too busy doing DS and sleeping afterwards
6/29/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: I trusted our master version as we handed it in was free of bugs
6/29/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: But apparently I cant trust my groupmates to not fuck up shit when I'm not looking
6/29/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: This is like groupwork 101
6/29/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Never trust anyone lol
6/29/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Like ever
6/29/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: It's like building a skyscraper with only a screwdriver and 2 toddlers
6/29/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: The toddlers will kick down everything you build
6/29/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: LOL
6/29/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: i want to frame that quote
6/29/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes
6/29/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: It's amazing how much easier this would've been if I did everything by myself
6/29/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: And I'm not even good at any of this
6/29/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: When it looked kind of like it did now, the frontend guy said "yeah I'll make it material"
6/29/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: He made the buttons uglier, then said "hey its material now"
6/29/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I feel you man
6/29/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Groupwork 101
6/29/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Rule #1 of group work: work with competent people

6/29/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: Hey guys do you know how many correct answers we need on the USE exam to pass it? And maybe how the grade is calculated can also work
6/29/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 39 for a 5
6/29/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: Thank you!
6/29/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: calculation depends on the number of questions they take out
6/30/17, 06:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If they don't take anything out it was 41/60 for a 5.5 I thought

6/30/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: To the awesome guys who made the USE test: is there a version without the answers?
6/30/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: No but I also would like that
6/30/17, 10:46 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I'll make it around 13:30
6/30/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Somehow my brain always tries to read the answer upside down when I read the D option.
6/30/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Like how without the answers?
6/30/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ahh, that way
6/30/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: And then an answer sheet at the end or smth I guess

6/30/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: I was looking through it and couldn't see which of the options were correct, I only now noticed that I was looking at the one without the answers

6/30/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Are there people who want a seperate answer sheet for the USE thingy?
6/30/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because it is like one minute of work to make one :P
6/30/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Then yeh sure

6/30/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: The order does not matter, since the LTS's are not ordered in any way
6/30/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you take the transitions at the same time, so the order does not matter
6/30/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Ah oke thank you!
6/30/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: np

6/30/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: How long did it take last time
6/30/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Like 2 second
6/30/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Seconds
6/30/17, 13:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hahaha
6/30/17, 13:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys chill
6/30/17, 13:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Probably today if not on monday
6/30/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: If someone in your use group dropped out do you still get graded out of 100?
6/30/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I think so yes, but I think they will also take that into account when grading
6/30/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: They take that into account
6/30/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: <Media omitted>
6/30/17, 14:18 - ‪+40 720 172 618‬: Idk if somebody already pointed this out, but week 2, question 17: the correct answer is "The Age of Participation"
6/30/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: The grade for their part becomes the average of the rest of the thing I believe
6/30/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: @31642623926 this is indeed true
6/30/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I know, @31630168397 has changed it iirc
6/30/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: yeah but not uploaded
6/30/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Perhaps it would also be nice to add the images to some questions
6/30/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'd like to share a meme but am not in the spamchat, can I do it here for once?
6/30/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: one tome
6/30/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: time
6/30/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I promise the meme is really good
6/30/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 😂
6/30/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31642007885 @31623837581 @31683038783
6/30/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: if you can provide an argument as to why you would rather post it here than in the designated area I might allow it this one time
6/30/17, 16:04 - Luke Houben: Also give a formal proof that this meme is indeed really good
6/30/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I don't have access to the designated area at this time and I'd like to not be added
6/30/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 👆🏻
6/30/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I hope it's self evident
6/30/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You are in the gay guy chat so why not leave it there?
6/30/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But the only way to prove that we would like it, it to post it here
6/30/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: The meme had everything one could desire, from references to pop culture to topical and relevant topics
6/30/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: there's a limited amount of people in there
6/30/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh nvm ill do it in the spam chat
6/30/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Maques is right nit everyone is into traps
6/30/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Thank you

6/30/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: here are two USE exams from previous years
6/30/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: with answers to them
6/30/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I'll put them on cs-students too

6/30/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The last questions of the exam of 2015 are translated now and images have been added to some questions
6/30/17, 17:13 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thanks man, which years are those ?
6/30/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 2014 and 2013 I think
6/30/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: not sure
6/30/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Where did you get those
6/30/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Protagoras had those, but the questions are quite different
6/30/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: The questions are indeed very different
6/30/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: well, they are from past years
6/30/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so if you want to, you can use them for practice
6/30/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: yeah some questions are good but some have definitions which we have never had
6/30/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: well, then only make the questions that you see are useful
6/30/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I only know that they will be putting questions from past exams on the exam of this year, but which ones, I don't know. So if you want to prepare, you can just make the questions that you think are useful, and skip out on the rest
6/30/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: true
6/30/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Still no ds :(
6/30/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Pfff
6/30/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i went to Speckmann today and she told me that they are uploaded, but everyone who got a lower grade than before will not receive their grades
6/30/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: as they are put in the same test label
6/30/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: What, nice joke again
6/30/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Hahahah

6/30/17, 21:31 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: fatoe but stop asking everyday

6/30/17, 23:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sure
6/30/17, 23:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Why not
6/30/17, 23:55 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: If it wasn't hakan saying this at 23:50 I would actually go and check
6/30/17, 23:57 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: What if it was 22:33?
6/30/17, 23:57 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: would that work ?
6/30/17, 23:57 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I mean, peer evaluation right?
6/30/17, 23:58 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah I think that would improve the reliability of your model
7/1/17, 00:03 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: improve your improvement bro
7/1/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: That's some deep shit
7/1/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: theres some mistakes in the use base test guys
7/1/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: test 4 q4, the answer is D, not A
7/1/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 2016 one?

7/1/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: test 6 q3, answer is C, not A
7/1/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: those are the mistakes Mart's girlfriend found
7/1/17, 11:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Also thought so
7/1/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: <Media omitted>
7/1/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: This one is C?
7/1/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I'm pretty sure it's A
7/1/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Het ondersteboven antwoord is toch ook A?
7/1/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Ja
7/1/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: youre right nick
7/1/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i didnt look at the question before i said it
7/1/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Hahaha
7/1/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: tessa is wrong

7/1/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: <Media omitted>
7/1/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: What
7/1/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: 10/10 yet it says that it's wrong
7/1/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so it says here that both answers are corrent
7/1/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: correct
7/1/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: <Media omitted>
7/1/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: uhu
7/1/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Pretty sure it's just that one
7/1/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: idk man
7/1/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: redelijk apart
7/1/17, 11:16 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Idk according to reading  experience etc makes more sense to me
7/1/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: Maybe both answers are correct
7/1/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that seems.. improbable
7/1/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: You are improbable
7/1/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks
7/1/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ik heb n mail gestuurd
7/1/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: vragend om het goede antwoord
7/1/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: There are more questions where 2 answers were accepted
7/1/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: probably it doesnt even matter, since its a pretty explicit question
7/1/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: too detailed to be acceptable on an exam
7/1/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then again, nothing surprises me with these guys
7/1/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys
7/1/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how did these guys calculate the grade again?
7/1/17, 11:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: max, as long as you have 2/3 of the answers correct you pass
7/1/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: since 39/60 is 5.0  2/3 is always safe
7/1/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that doesnt really helo m
7/1/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: e
7/1/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: help me
7/1/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: how does that not help

7/1/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: There you go
7/1/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: you know that you pass if 2/3 or more is correct
7/1/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: who cares about the exact grade lol
7/1/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Good luck with calculating grades for the rest of all of the points max😂
7/1/17, 11:47 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Gonna take you a while
7/1/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks
7/1/17, 11:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh

7/1/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: b u l l s h i t
7/1/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Can't you just say that 17/60 points is a 0, and 60/60 is a 10, and it's just linear between those two points?
7/1/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
7/1/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: should work that way i guess?
7/1/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I don't think they would not have it linear, so this is kinda the only way they could do it
7/1/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Should I study the Morton Thiokol case for USE? There are a lot of questions about it in the weekly tests
7/1/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Do it
7/1/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Is there an answer to q26 of the exam from 2015?
7/1/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The one in the large pdf?
7/1/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Yes
7/1/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Isn't there an answer?

7/1/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: I can check again just to be sure
7/1/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, there isn't
7/1/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: There really is no answer
7/1/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ill look it up for ya
7/1/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Thanks

7/1/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Thanks ❤
7/1/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for the questions from the weekly tests, is it made up of only the chapters that will be on the test, or also the ones that won't be on there?
7/1/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I mean the document with all the questions and answers that was made
7/1/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: ch5 was in the weeklies though I dont know if thise questions are also in the compiled doc

7/1/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: hey guys, in the "oefenexamens" file on CS-students about USE contain questions about things i have never even heard of... Is this a bit outdated or am i doomed to fail?
7/1/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It's outdated
7/1/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: ah, thanks
7/1/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but you're still doomed to fail so it doesn't matter that much :)
7/1/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: :(
7/1/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 👌🏻👌🏻
7/1/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: <Media omitted>
7/1/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Please😊
7/1/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is it?
7/1/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well considering utilitarianism doesn't say things about happiness
7/1/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Those are goner
7/1/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: kantianism
7/1/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: what does that say
7/1/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Yeah I didn't think so either... but the markscheme says the answer is d
7/1/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just eliminate things
7/1/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Kantianism is about universalism and means and ends
7/1/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay then virtue ethics is left
7/1/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: easypeasy
7/1/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: So virtue ethics would be the only thing left
7/1/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But isn't utilitarianism literally about maximising happiness?
7/1/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Utaliterianism is about happiness for greatest amount of people?
7/1/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Yes this...
7/1/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Like utilitarianism goes for the action that brings the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people
7/1/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That
7/1/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Well said😂
7/1/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: It's all about the second exception I guess
7/1/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nonono
7/1/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't think it is about bringing happiness
7/1/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is about bringing the best outcome for the greatest good
7/1/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: THe best option
7/1/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not necessarily happiness
7/1/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: <Media omitted>
7/1/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: WHelp
7/1/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then wth is the answer
7/1/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: its virtue ethics because the question states that the theory were talking about says that it is impossible to formulate a precies rule for moral behaviour
7/1/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh but the way the question is asked is not about the happiness for the greatest good at all
7/1/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It just asks which theory is about focusing on happiness in general
7/1/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But Mill's utilitarianism also doesn't use a precise measure of happiness
7/1/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: So it could be C as well
7/1/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: May I suggest to leave some comments on a question like this?
7/1/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So that we can grab some free points
7/1/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No Mill's doesn't say anything about judging moral behaviour
7/1/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah, definitely
7/1/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it is the combination
7/1/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think everything gets kicked out here except virtue ethics
7/1/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: ^
7/1/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But like Ruben says, just comment as much as possible
7/1/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: kant gets kicked by it being about happiness
7/1/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: uti gets kicked because of the impossible to form a precies judgement statement
7/1/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Ok, I get that. But still, how does virtue ethics focus on happiness?
7/1/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Virtue ethics is the only one which says its impossible to formulate a precise rule for judging moral behavior. Utilitarianism says its possible by just choosing the options which provides the most hapiness for the most people, kantianism has nothing to do with hapiness. So its virtue ethics
7/1/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no idea
7/1/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks Thorn
7/1/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But basically after ruling 3 options out you have 1 left
7/1/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Was a little late i see
7/1/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Well fuck my internet :p
7/1/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's usually how I do it
7/1/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: <Media omitted>
7/1/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: And this mentions that hapiness is a part of virtue ethica
7/1/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Ah, I guess that makes sense, thanks!
7/1/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Yeah I guess it make sense when you really analyse it but I wouldn't have got for it in an exam, thanks anyway everybody :)
7/1/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Is participation by mediation the same as participation by invitation?
7/1/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: what
7/1/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: mediation means bemiddelen
7/1/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: invitation means uitnodiging
7/1/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no they're not equal
7/1/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
7/1/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
7/1/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ahh well just look at it this way
7/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: People go talk to solve something
7/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So they "bemiddel"
7/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: i think they are the same
7/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: not 100% sure tho
7/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yeah
7/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They mediate with eachother
7/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Some give something and then they gain on other fields
7/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: reaching an accord
7/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and agreement
7/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's mediating
7/1/17, 21:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The emphasis was not on the invitation they received for that here
7/1/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: In de oude druk they called it participation by invitation. Thats why you see it in all the summaries
7/1/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: In de nieuwe druk they call it participation by mediation
7/1/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It is also in some of the questions of 2015 exam
7/1/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: So consider them to be the same
7/1/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooh great
7/1/17, 21:36 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Thanks for the clarification Tijs!

7/1/17, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But there is this small chance
7/1/17, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I had a hunch
7/1/17, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I know it's hakan max but every time I have this small hope left that there is actually a grade on there
7/1/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: that's why I took one for the team and checked
7/1/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Heart rate goes slowly back to normal
7/1/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can someone tell me where I can find the reader: "Engineers in a Changing World" that is mentioned a couple of times in the 2015 exam included with the online test questions? Or is it not something we need to know anymore?
7/1/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Outdated

7/1/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Posting false grades is also spam and i think also very annoying , what do you guys think? Is posting False grades or saying that the grades are online even though they aren't a reason for kick?

7/2/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: What was the conflict between safety and comfort I would wonder myself at first
7/2/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31621372984  Try not to spam
7/2/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wasnt meant as spam, sorry
7/2/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but
7/2/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the question
7/2/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyone?
7/2/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it was either A or C we decided yesterday
7/2/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: A I think
7/2/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: canvas accepted them both
7/2/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah that's what i thought too
7/2/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but tessa answered C and got a 10
7/2/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Because they did the routine checks
7/2/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: The routine checks they did were not complete though
7/2/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: In the text it is explicitly said that they took experience and materials into consideration
7/2/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight, so we're gonna decide on A then?
7/2/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Nope I think it should be C
7/2/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That's why they are _routine_ checks
7/2/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I guess
7/2/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: But C is correct for sure, that one is not really open for interpretation
7/2/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: A is kind of open for interpretation
7/2/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh
7/2/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hmmm
7/2/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the thing why I'm not sure is that canvas i saw an example where canvas accepted C but said "correct answer is A" underneath the question when reviewing
7/2/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but also saw a case where A was simply counted right
7/2/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: without the opmerking
7/2/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I think A is correct as well
7/2/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Since they did checks but they were just not suited
7/2/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Shall we just say the question and answers are badly formulated and to make up for the bad formulation the people of USE just accept both answers?
7/2/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: That would also mean that this question will definitely not be on the exam
7/2/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Probably
7/2/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight
7/2/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright so C is definitely correct
7/2/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I think A is too though
7/2/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I agree
7/2/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so lets just say they are both correct and be done with it aight?
7/2/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ya
7/2/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Im not worried this questions not gonna be on the exam anyway
7/2/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: (probably)
7/2/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: when they decide that a question should be removed from the exam (which happened with 6 questions last year), what happens exactly?
7/2/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: they just adjust the grading for the exam to have 6 questions lesS?
7/2/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so instead of working with 60 they work with 54 questions
7/2/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: shouldn't matter for the grade
7/2/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not that much anyway
7/2/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well then suddenly other questions matter more :p
7/2/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For Modeling an Psychology we got free points for questions they fucked up
7/2/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Think it should be like that when a multiple choice question has an ambiguous answer list
7/2/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I mean, other questions mattering more shouldn't matter
7/2/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if all questions weigh more it doesnt matter
7/2/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it starts mattering when there's certain questions that matter more than others
7/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: all it means is that if you have more questions correct than incorrect your grade goes up
7/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if youve got more wrong than right youre fucked anyway
7/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What if you knew the answer to one but they removed it because it was really difficult
7/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then your correct answer is gone suddenly
7/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ahhh i see what youre saying
7/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And you're left with potential other errors that now weigh more
7/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i see
7/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 🙊 just trying to think about it haha
7/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I have no clue what they do
7/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah idk how they deal with it
7/2/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it'd be fair to have the people who got it right get bonus points, and people who got it wrong just
7/2/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk
7/2/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not reducting points
7/2/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: with them shouting things like lower treshold and grading can become more lenient, i'd say free points?
7/2/17, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ya
7/2/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: btw
7/2/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: which one is correct
7/2/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: norms and rules
7/2/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guessing its B?
7/2/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yah
7/2/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
7/2/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: "the new wheel design was based on existing experience". In the answer they say "a failure to consider existing experience". They did take existing experience into account so why would c be correct?
7/2/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Which of the answers was NOT a factor that lead to disaster
7/2/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Is the question
7/2/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ahh okay
7/2/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Its b
7/2/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Because there was a shift
7/2/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: In that time, the 'users' of the road changed. It was used by pedestrians, but cars took over. So posters asked pedestrians to stay away from roads
7/2/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jeah i know that lol, but why
7/2/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Yeah
7/2/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: in A they blame the motorcyclist (age of promise)
7/2/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: This
7/2/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ah, that makes much sense
7/2/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: thanks robin
7/2/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: 👍🏻
7/2/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: You have no idea, how happy i am that i could answer that😅
7/2/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hahahah shit i wanted to answer it

7/2/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'd like to add that
7/2/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it's a sumary
7/2/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'd recommend reading the full stories
7/2/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but it's a nice way to refresh memory
7/2/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Both A and C are correct. At first there was a mistake in the grading system. It showed A as incorrect and only C as correct, so I emailed them about a week ago. They agreed that both are correct and changed grading scheme.
7/2/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight thanks karina
7/2/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Can someone maybe have a brief explanation for advisory code of conduct, disciplinary CoC and aspirational CoC to easily distinguish? I find it really difficult to specify what the differences are
7/2/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I keep mixing them up
7/2/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: And isnt the aspirational CoC part of the corporate CoC?
7/2/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Aspirational codes in corporate CoC are usually like "as a company, we value..."
7/2/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But most professional codes of conduct are almost entirely aspirational I think
7/2/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Wait, is D the correct answer there?
7/2/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: corporation cannot revoke their license to practice
7/2/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's what I would reason at least
7/2/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Ohh
7/2/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: ah that makes sense
7/2/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but yeh the answer is D
7/2/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But even then, that just means that it can't be corporate
7/2/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Although disciplinary sounds nice to me as well
7/2/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why isn't it that
7/2/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It sounds more like B to me
7/2/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I'm wondering that as well
7/2/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yeah I had no idea what the answer for this question since all of them except advisory could be correct
7/2/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: disciplinary code is about values and norms i guess thats not what this statement is about
7/2/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 5 questions got removed from the exam and this one did not, so im guessing there is a reason why D is correct
7/2/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: it sounds more like: if you disclose confidential information you lose your job
7/2/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "we advise you to not do that"
7/2/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it says "they may be sanctioned"
7/2/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not "they will be"
7/2/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So it's an advise
7/2/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: yeah but still
7/2/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
7/2/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is exactly what would sound logical
7/2/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: WAT
7/2/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: red = correct
7/2/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: in these lectures
7/2/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: btw
7/2/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is what I would answer while not knowing anything about the matter
7/2/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: okay im done
7/2/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: omw to Vertigo's roof now brb
7/2/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I mean disciplinary sounds way better
7/2/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: just look for synonyms and `20% of the questions can be answered
7/2/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah. Especially for advisory codes. The definition is about helping engineers make moral decisions, and that is usually also mentioned in a question where advisory is the answer
7/2/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it's not in the study guide so it only applies to the weekly questions (for which, in fact, all of the cases applied)
7/2/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Aren't there a lot of people with a positive view towards abortion?
7/2/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Seems more like a virtue to me then
7/2/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: the way it's written constitutes the format of a rules by which we can decide what is morally permissible. Hence it's a moral norm
7/2/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oooh wait
7/2/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I thought the opinion was what the question was about
7/2/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: but it is literally about that sentence
7/2/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: thanks Jort, then I get it
7/2/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah, the first sentence is the statement
7/2/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 👍🏻
7/2/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: ethical cycle is chapter 5 (which we do not have to study)
7/2/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: So what chapters do we have to study again? 😅
7/2/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Are you sure we don't have to do chapter 5?
7/2/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes
7/2/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Which do we need to do then?
7/2/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well that is in the slides iirc
7/2/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In the study guide the same chapters are listed but those still include chapter 5
7/2/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: so just remove that from the list
7/2/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 123789
7/2/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is what is says in the slides
7/2/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Thanks 😘

7/2/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: I saw that, too Daan
7/2/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: That's why I was confused
7/2/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Is it 123689 ot 123789
7/2/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooh yeah apparently these people who like to mess around included ch. 5 in the allmighty study guide
7/2/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: but removed it from the slides
7/2/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I messed up
7/2/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Haha Ruben
7/2/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And did 7 in stead of 6
7/2/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Sorry
7/2/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Okay:
Chapters 1,2,3,6,8 and 9
7/2/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Confirmed
7/2/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Thanks guys
7/2/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: No problem
7/2/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Does the enw academic year start the 4th of september?
7/2/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: new*
7/2/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: one of those days yes
7/2/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then it is OAJ, yes
7/2/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Like the big party with 1500 litres of free beer
7/2/17, 14:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 4 officialy but irl its 5 because 4 is sunday
7/2/17, 14:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think
7/2/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I really like the attitude of starting your next academic year on monday and drinking yourself to waste the sunday evening before that
7/2/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, then it is on the sunday
7/2/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sorry, on the monday
7/2/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: the 5th then
7/2/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahaha
7/2/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The 4th is a monday Dimitar...
7/2/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lel
7/2/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So yes, the party is on monday as well.
7/2/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: All summer to get wasted
7/2/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Let's do it on the first day we need to proof we're worth our €2000 again
7/2/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Amazing :p
7/2/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: hahahaha nice
7/2/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, 1500 litres is 30 kegs of beer, and depending on your hectoliterkorting a keg of beer is around 120 euros, so you'd need to drink about 55
7/2/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 55% of the beer to get your tuition back?
7/2/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: challenge accepted
7/2/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Which in turn equals to about 4000 beers
7/2/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: So for you it's an instrumental value, dickwad
7/2/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm good point
7/2/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Also which summary is that?
7/2/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: the one on CS-students without the (2) behind it)
7/2/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Is it good?
7/2/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i thought the (1) and the (2) were the same
7/2/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nice to read
7/2/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: More compact
7/2/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Also there is not (1) Tobin
7/2/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: no*
7/2/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: then how should I describe it
7/2/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: the   and the (2)?
7/2/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: The one without the (2)
7/2/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: anyone knows if we will be getting questions about the specific CASE studies that we have done as well, like mobility, or will it only be about the general knowledge from Ethics and History parts?
7/2/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I dont think there are seperate versions for every case
7/2/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: the rooms are allocated based on study, not on tutorial group
7/2/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: okay
7/2/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thanks
7/2/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: would be retarded to ask me stuff about nuclear energy right
7/2/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so theyd have to have 8 different tests, each with multiple versions, and have those 80y/o granny's go ask everyone which group they belong to
7/2/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, if you say it like that, it's indeed pretty weird if they would actually have questions from different cases on it
7/2/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, they probably ARE gonna ask stuff about the cases from the book tho...
7/2/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, but I meant it more like: do we need to know specific stuff about OUR cases, the one you chose to do, and answer questions about that
7/2/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: AFAIK not
7/2/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: like getting a piece of text about self driving cars and answering questions about that
7/2/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, but what can they ask about that?
7/2/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: idk
7/2/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I was just wondering about it
7/2/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: how do you correctly spell the social emdia site "Fuckbook"?
7/2/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: it doesn't have an answer in the answers pdf file
7/2/17, 15:14 - Bart van Dooren: C
7/2/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thanks
7/2/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i just saw someone looking at a dickpick in the train
7/2/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it was so hairy
7/2/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: nice max
7/2/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i think because its between her personal gain and her company gain
7/2/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: While C can cause the engineer to launch the product even while it has nasty drawbacks, just to save his/her partner
7/2/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: it would be beneficial for both cases in C
7/2/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: the engineer is working on something that could help his/her partner
7/2/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: If she wants to stop the launch it might seem that it's for her own profit, not because of an actual design flaw
7/2/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But it isn't an actual conflict of interest, right?
7/2/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Which is what the question asks
7/2/17, 16:38 - Bas Gieling: its a conflict of interest because she has 2 interests:
1 - she wants her own company to do good (because she is loyal) and driving her own company to bankruptcy would most likely lead to her losing het job
2 - she wants the other company to do good because money
7/2/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you wanna get kicked for spam? cause this is how you get kicked for spam
7/2/17, 16:38 - Bas Gieling: which cant both be achieved at the same time
7/2/17, 16:39 - Bas Gieling: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ahh, I see
7/2/17, 16:40 - Bas Gieling: (the answer sheet says true)
7/2/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Maybe because if there is no context, everyone's happiness counts equally
7/2/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wait, I get this reasoning, but shouldn't there also be the interest of the general public, which is also in favor
7/2/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nvm, you still get a conflict of interest with the company interests
7/2/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Isn't the only difference between bentham en mill the way how happiness is obtained? So it's still equal for every person
7/2/17, 16:43 - Bas Gieling: but it states "everyone's happiness counts equally", while mill clearly said that its better to be an unhappy smart dude than a happy dumb dude, right?
7/2/17, 16:43 - Bas Gieling: or did i interpret that wrong
7/2/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: a mans happiness is worth more than a pigs happiness
7/2/17, 16:43 - Bas Gieling: right
7/2/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Dumb dude != Pig
7/2/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: Are you sure? :p
7/2/17, 16:45 - Bas Gieling: i remember reading the statement "it is better to be socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied"
7/2/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: In this case*
7/2/17, 16:46 - Bas Gieling: right?
7/2/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
7/2/17, 16:46 - Bas Gieling: that confuses me
7/2/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It's confusing
7/2/17, 16:48 - Bas Gieling: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I think the answer is true because it is true according to Bentham's utilitarianism, which is like "The original utilitarianism"
7/2/17, 16:49 - Bas Gieling: sounds like a fair reason, id make a complaint about the question nonetheless
7/2/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Mill's utilitarianism is an extension of Bentham's
7/2/17, 16:49 - Bas Gieling: yea
7/2/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Complaining, always +1
7/2/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But yes, it is a vague question
7/2/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Equality is different from everyone's happiness counts equally
7/2/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, If I understand Professional responsibility correctly it is your responsibility as for example a mechanical engineer to build excellent machines
7/2/17, 16:51 - Bas Gieling: fair enough, good point
7/2/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Doctors to heal people
7/2/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And to help people
7/2/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh okay that way so actually just do what your supposed to do
7/2/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: What your profession requires you to do
7/2/17, 16:51 - Bas Gieling: more or less
7/2/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: If you see a crash a doctor is suppose to help
7/2/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: As a professional
7/2/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah okay I get it thanks
7/2/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm not sure whether this was mentioned or not, but does anyone know the passing rate of this course last year?
7/2/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: http://i.imgur.com/0myQRQ3.png
7/2/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: So somewhere around 80%
7/2/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh nice! Thanks
7/2/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: darn. I see we should be scared for automata
7/2/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: automata only about 2/3 of all of us will succeed the exam on Friday if you look at the stats
7/2/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: what are the passing rates of automata by gerard de zwaan tho
7/2/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: lol
7/2/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Interested in those yes

7/2/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I have no idea why but I've determined that if yous ee a question like this and theres an answer about wind turbines it is correct
7/2/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: There was a guy who made wind turbines available for everybody
7/2/17, 18:58 - Bas Gieling: solid reasoning
7/2/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Because user tinkerers build the wind turbines and also contribute to apps now
7/2/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: bakkes
7/2/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This guy was called poul la cour
7/2/17, 19:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ah thanks I remember now
7/2/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Solid knowledge guys, keep it up, proud of you

7/2/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Could someone plz tell me the difference between virtue and value ?
7/2/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Virtue is a character trait
7/2/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: virtue is aimed towards happiness
7/2/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and what Anne says
7/2/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: company is not a character
7/2/17, 19:31 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Thank you everyone !
7/2/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and the difference between a norm and a value?
7/2/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Norm is more formulated like a rule
7/2/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: A norm must be kept/adhered to, a value is something that is important to you
7/2/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Norm is if->then
7/2/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Value is something worth striving for in general
7/2/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight so
virtue -> character trait
norm -> "rule"
value -> something to strive for
7/2/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: A virtue (kindness) leads to value (Something to strive for) leads to a norm (Something that has to be done/maintained to achieve the thing you strive for)
7/2/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Good
7/2/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Is there a definition for 'non user'?
7/2/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: uhm, i guess everyone whos not a user..?
7/2/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Max has this shit figured out
7/2/17, 19:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: jwz
7/2/17, 19:38 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: There is a different in a value and value right. Since value still means intrinsic/instrumental value as well?
7/2/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Like a value is something to strive for. But value is worthness?
7/2/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yup
7/2/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lol dis makes no sense
7/2/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: shush
7/2/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah but a value in ethical context is the first one
7/2/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: something that we perceive as good
7/2/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but in economical context or something like that it is indeed what something is worth
7/2/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: I know, but the book also talks about intrinsic and instrumental value
7/2/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Which is about its economical meaning
7/2/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: intrinsic isnt?
7/2/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: intrinsic has to do with feels n stuff
7/2/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: you know
7/2/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: things within you
7/2/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: besides ur guts
7/2/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Intrinsic is the value of itself
7/2/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Intrinsic meaning you value the thing itself and not just what it can get you
7/2/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Instrumental is a means to an end
7/2/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: intrinsic is the ethical value
7/2/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: instrumental the economical value
7/2/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: So the love for the thing, but it's not the same as an ethical value
7/2/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: No
7/2/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: .
7/2/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Intrinsic values are good because they simply are. Instrumental values are good because they eventually lead to an intrinsic value
7/2/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: oh wait yeah
7/2/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: forget what i said dante
7/2/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Already did

7/2/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: No need to say sorry dude, discussions help everyone
7/2/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: he is completely right
7/2/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i confused this with mmgo lol
7/2/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: my bad

7/2/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: How do i know its b
7/2/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Remember it
7/2/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I didn't know it and still don't know why
7/2/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I know now
7/2/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They don't ask "why" at a multiple choice exam
7/2/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: In the case about the DC-10 they mention that the two companies involved both didn't want to take action and address the problem of the cargo thing opening mid-flight, because the companies kind of hated each other at the time.
7/2/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When your hatred kills 300+ people
7/2/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: And that's the only case where something like that was brought up
7/2/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I know right
7/2/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Hm should i read all of the case
7/2/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Cases
7/2/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I only read the ones jort said its important
7/2/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: jort is god
7/2/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I'm not sure how he decided which cases were important and which weren't
7/2/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But I think that might ask questions about any of the cases in one of the chapters that we had to study
7/2/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i dont think its worth looking for *all*  the cases and studying them all
7/2/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: reading the ones Jort sent should be fine
7/2/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
7/2/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The important cases are listed in a file on canvas
7/2/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Engineers in a changing world is the history book that was used in previous years, which is quite similar to the book we should have read.
7/2/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: "should" 😂😂
7/2/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ok I'll look into it thanks

7/2/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: @31630168397
7/2/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: If only I knew what was necessary for blameworthiness
7/2/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: if you guys knew latin you'd know it was D 🤓

7/2/17, 23:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanks tho :>
7/2/17, 23:12 - Bas Gieling: persons is a correct word
7/2/17, 23:12 - Bas Gieling: especially in this context
7/2/17, 23:12 - Bas Gieling: its very formal, mostly used in laws n such
7/2/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: persons isnt wrong dimi
7/2/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it can be used
7/2/17, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh

7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Just because
7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This is a fucking sneaky question
7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Read the case
7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I did
7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Shouldnt it be A or sth
7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because it is because they changed from welded joints to bolted ones
7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Not other way around
7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Like D would be the last answer id go for after C
7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And not the other way around
7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oh
7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Okay
7/2/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Dammit
7/2/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz thats all u ever want
7/2/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: So whats the answer for that
7/2/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and indeed it is D
7/2/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: A
7/2/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: C hakan
7/2/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sorry, D
7/2/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: because the other ones are not right
7/2/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: It says
7/2/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Fact
7/2/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: they changed from welded to bolted, so A is wrong
7/2/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah
7/2/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: the other two are just bs
7/2/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: but new york city building code is important too
7/2/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so its D
7/2/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nop
7/2/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: they neever use bolted in nyc
7/2/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: look at the NY skyline
7/2/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: there is no specific building code in NY
7/2/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Normally bolting only causes a minor inconvenience
7/2/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: thnx for clarification
7/2/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah but that wouldnt be a problem if it werent for the weird design
7/2/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: this. but bc of the design, it caused major inconvenience to say the least
7/2/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i was just being sarcastic with nyc
7/2/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: calm the tatas
7/2/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Where exactly is the problem of paralysis mentioned?
7/3/17, 00:03 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Probably they used a reader instead of the book we used this year, since they mention reader every time
7/3/17, 00:03 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So i wouldnt worry too much about it
7/3/17, 00:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ahh, okay
7/3/17, 00:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Thanks!
7/3/17, 07:06 - Bas Gieling: there is, but the building actually met the building code requirements
7/3/17, 07:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Same thing lol
7/3/17, 07:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nah jk

7/3/17, 08:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Depends if they hit anyone, but yeah usually they are fun
7/3/17, 08:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm taking a risk

7/3/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: but we should be able to prove them right
7/3/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes, you should be able to reproduce parts of the proofs
7/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: and i wouldnt be able to do the shit they come up with all by myself
7/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: They will point you in the direction
7/3/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Just get a feeling of how to do them is actually how you should do it
7/3/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: and we may use lemmas and theorems from the reader in our proofs right?
7/3/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is there a file with elaborations on the exemplary test of 14june2017 somewhere?
7/3/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: The last lecture was that
7/3/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: yeah i know but was anyone crazy enough to write it down in a nice, maybe even digital, way?

7/3/17, 15:28 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Not crazy enough to write  but these are all the answers vink wrote down
7/3/17, 15:28 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Oh shit the First one isn't automata
7/3/17, 15:28 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: The others are
7/3/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: thanks!
7/3/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
7/3/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I came up with: "Take DFA X which accepts language L and remove the initial state and a-transition. Then make the state that the a-transition pointed to the initial state"
7/3/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think you can't remove the initial state, because there might be other transitions that to that state.
7/3/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But you can keep all the states, just change which one is the initial state and that should still work
7/3/17, 16:02 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: we won't get these types of questions on the exam
7/3/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Eh okay, but why not?
7/3/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: i think this is from an exam of Q2 of this course
7/3/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Lol you fucked up
7/3/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is the easy version of the course Léon
7/3/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: but it has exactly the same course code..?
7/3/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: or wait its 71 instead of 70
7/3/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: ffs
7/3/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 71 is the name of the test
7/3/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but it sucks
7/3/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: its just that it is in q2 that makes it easier then, not very clear
7/3/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: It was from a previous test i found no the gewis website
7/3/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Are there any other tests to practice aside from the one on the canvas page?
7/3/17, 16:23 - Bart van Dooren: Because in Q2 the course is given by gerard which makes the test different then eric which gives the course in Q4
7/3/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Damnit, there were quiet a lot of free points on the exam from Q2
7/3/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yup
7/3/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: There is the one of 2015, it is also on the gewis site and on cs students
7/3/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: not 2015, but resit of 2016*
7/3/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: and the one of 2016 july can be found on the old page of automata by vink
7/3/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: and cs students
7/3/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
7/3/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: those are relevant
7/3/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: the rest is super out dated
7/3/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: and not similar to the one from 2016
7/3/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ones
7/3/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Thanks!
7/3/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: in OSIRIS, does it say for u guys also weighthing 30 for automata grade? if so isnt it supposed to be 40?
7/3/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yeah they said they would fix it
7/3/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: alright thanks
7/3/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
7/3/17, 21:58 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think that's the question that the photos above are the answer to
7/3/17, 21:58 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: This one
7/3/17, 21:59 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Ah i see know, thanks again
7/3/17, 22:00 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: This solution was incorrect. I asked after lecture. The solution they discussed did not concider v beign the empty string. Although this language is context free, the proof discussed in the lecture is incorrect.
7/3/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: as the string a^m b^m a^m b^m a^m is symmetrical, pumping in the middel stream of a's will still result in a string beign an element in the language L. A different string w needs to be chosen to proof this.
7/3/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: The language is *not* context free right? But apparently we need another string to prove that
7/3/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: yup
7/3/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: sorry i see my mistake. It is not context free, but it is incorrectly proven in the lectures.
7/3/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: haha you got me confused for a sec, thanks tho
7/3/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: do you happen to know a string for which we could solve it tho?
7/3/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: I did not take a real effort to solve this, but what I think is that a string with (b a^m b) for v and (b a^3m b) should do the trick. However this seems overly complicated to proof. As it was an unintended mistake in the exam of last year.
7/3/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: nvm my suggestion doesnt work either
7/3/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: I have no idea, anyway, it will be way more difficult to proof that will be asked
7/3/17, 22:23 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: So don't focus on it since it contains a mistake?
7/3/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: I would say, understand what is supposed to be done. And act like you can proof it with the string w as given in the lecture
7/3/17, 22:24 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Do we have similar tasks in a book?
7/3/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: So the answer he gave was wrong?
7/3/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: I think you were supposed to make some similiar assignments in the tutor hours.
7/3/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That's nice
7/3/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: It was a minor mistake no one really noticed.
7/3/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Still kinda sucks though
7/3/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Figured he'd upload the correct answer or someting at least
7/3/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: I dont think there is a simple straightforward solution.
7/3/17, 22:25 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: so we'll get sth similar, but easier right ?
7/3/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: probably similair if w was correct.
7/3/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: it should be easier, but like... if you did notice the minor mistake they made probably similair in difficulty.
7/3/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: alright
7/4/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: what is the mail address if i want to ask roel bloo a question?
7/4/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: r.bloo@fontyssubmission.nl
7/4/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: .
7/4/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: ..
7/4/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: ...
7/4/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 🐢🙄
7/4/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: he had a special email address to ask questions
7/4/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooh I used this one last time I contacted him
7/4/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good luck :p
7/4/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 😂
7/4/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: Will 5.3 and 5.4 of automata be on the exam? There are slides about it, but nothing was mentioned in the example exam and during tutor hours plus there are no recommended exercises about it?
7/4/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What is it?
7/4/17, 14:33 - ‪+40 720 172 618‬: Mutual exclusion protocol and alternating bit protocol
7/4/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Wut?😂
7/4/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Probably not, but it is nice to understand what's going on to learn some more about LTS
7/4/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: thanks!
7/4/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jesus... You managed to notice that in that piece of text
7/4/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Correct
7/4/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: haha thanks
7/4/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: leon gonna ace this test
7/4/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Should we be able to prove the pumping lemma?🤔🤔
7/4/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Or is it unlikely that they make 2/3 of the test about that?
7/4/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: only give the CFL pumping lemma
7/4/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: not prove it
7/4/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Copyright Nick
7/4/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: They would have to give the answer for 2a if they ask us to prove the pumping lemma for CFL
7/4/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: So that'd be weird
7/4/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: you should also be able to prove the pumping lemma for CFLs
7/4/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: since its a lemma
7/4/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: but it would be weird
7/4/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: for the reason nick gave
7/4/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: at most they'll ask part of the proof
7/4/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: most proofs are a bit too much to just ask on the test to be proven out of nowhere
7/4/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: unless you'd learn them by heart but that's not the intention of the course
7/4/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it is actually Storm :p
7/4/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Strange but true
7/4/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: they want you to be able to interpret and finish proofs
7/4/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: half the midterm points were also just memorizing something by heart
7/4/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you learn the proving methods
7/4/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you CAN do it by memorizing
7/4/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: it's an easy 10 that way but then you basically miss what the course tries to learn you
7/4/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: though learning by heart still teaches one enough
7/4/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I think this course missed its learning objectives pretty clearly anyway
7/4/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: more even I guess
7/4/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yes
7/4/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is very interesting matter, but they missed literally everything about applications
7/4/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Stuff like CFGs is used in compilers, automata can be used in the verification of system
7/4/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: applications won't be teached
7/4/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But it wasn't mentioned a single time
7/4/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: theory>application in uni
7/4/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That's what I hate about this course: It is just dry theory and mathematics
7/4/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Regular universities yes, technical universities theory = application
7/4/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: At least the importance then
7/4/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For some courses you could actually see that
7/4/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Even Datastructures which I barely passed contained weekly exercises
7/4/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Automata exams seem to contain extensive proofs from the reader and not regular weekly exercises
7/4/17, 15:39 - Bas Gieling: i think this course is the introduction to courses we get later on where we are actually gonna apply the stuff
7/4/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: third year students told me Datastructures was by far their hardest course in the bachelor
7/4/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: so not sure why
7/4/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: maybe it is the vink/gerard difference
7/4/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: well the exam for automata is pretty straightforward
7/4/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Automata is just a study by heat exam
7/4/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: *heart
7/4/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you have 40% of the point learning 2 methods and a single logic line by heart
7/4/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: the rest will probably give you 30% if you guess in the right direction
7/4/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They had some exercises every week but the idea is that you make those by yourself, not motivated by some mark
7/4/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did some of those, for some reason it seems more vague than logic or DS
7/4/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LST had proofs as well and I even liked that course
7/4/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: the material at least
7/4/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, the lectures were impossible to follow because they were just too boring
7/4/17, 15:44 - ‪+40 720 172 618‬: The resit from last year actually had this
7/4/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and after 20 minutes of writing one single long symbolic sentence he would just say "oh well I don't get what I'm doing" and continue with something else
7/4/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Bettina actually knew what she was doing
7/4/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 15:47 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: What does it say?
7/4/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Study the practice exam by heart
7/4/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: because theoretical you should study the exercises and practice those
7/4/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Who dat?
7/4/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Your daddy
7/4/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: but it actually is equal to the final
7/4/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Thought so already lol
7/4/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah but a different proof
7/4/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So you will have to know them all
7/4/17, 15:48 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: From what I heard that it maybe the case that for example they show the proof "from left to right" but they might ask you do to opposite "right to left" like not 1 implies 2, but 2 implies 1
7/4/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: that sounds logical to me
7/4/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: okay I am getting some increased motivation because I can study it by heart
7/4/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Let's do this for the 5
7/4/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah they might just take the theorem from the exemplary test but then you need to prove the other side
7/4/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So they will do that probably?
7/4/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes
7/4/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm going for that
7/4/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We only have one exam per year right? we cannot see which one they got to practice compared to their actual exam
7/4/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: We have more exams
7/4/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: no there is an exemplary and real test from 2016
7/4/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: The one they got: http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/2it70/PDF2016/2it70-exam-july.pdf

7/4/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: then they got different ones haha
7/4/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: is Q2 every a counter example? Or can we assume you need to prove it
7/4/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 16:29 - Bas Gieling: voortgang > diploma aanvragen
7/4/17, 16:30 - Kevin Jilissen: Should we do that once we have received our grades for this quartile or can we do that already?
7/4/17, 16:30 - Bas Gieling: you can do that already
7/4/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You can do it now
7/4/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: do anyone have a summary for automata?
7/4/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: does*

7/4/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Seriously guys?
7/4/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: After one year, nobody knows how this university works?
7/4/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: what is the matter
7/4/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: When you need somebodies e-mail, just google Name + tue
7/4/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Same goes for room, pin number, sexual preferences, an example of bad webdesign or any other information you can ever need
7/4/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: example of bad web design 😂
7/4/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: I don't think they will ask questions about chapter 2 or 4, will they?
7/4/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: Both of those have already been assessed in an assignment counting 20%
7/4/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 3 and 5 only
7/4/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys, do we have to reapply on studielink if we passed this year ?
7/4/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
7/4/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes we do
7/4/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Okay
7/4/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: And did you guys got any confirmation of your plan in planapp?
7/4/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Get*
7/4/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You won't get any for a while
7/4/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That screen looks as boring as it did before
7/4/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nothing changed
7/4/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Do we have to include the subject we didnt pass the first year ?
7/4/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That I do not know 😯
7/4/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Is there anywhere i can find the solutions of the exam
7/4/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: now that winedt is no longer supported on tue laptops, can anyone recommend a good replacement editor for latex?
7/4/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: html and css
7/4/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 👍🏻
7/4/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: im not actually kidding that much. There are programs out there that can make pdfs and stuff using html and css
7/4/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I believe that through TU/e you can get a key for WinEdt
7/4/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I don't remember where though
7/4/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Intranet.tue.nl
7/4/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just Overleaf? :p

7/4/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You didn't say w = uvxyz
7/4/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: further it looks decent I think?
7/4/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Thankss
7/4/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I find it easier to memorize it with quantifiers
7/4/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ahh
7/4/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ye with quantifiers its also fine i assume
7/4/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it got discontunues
7/4/17, 19:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Isn't it standard on the tue laptop
7/4/17, 19:06 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: i reinstalled it
7/4/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Help -> Register WinEdt, ther you can use the code
7/4/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: the ftp link to the code linked on the website is broken :/
7/4/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I have it somewhere I think
7/4/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: if you do that'd be awesome :)
7/4/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you're a hero
7/4/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: thank you so much
7/4/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: No problem
7/4/17, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: If you want a simple latex editor you can try Texworks, if you want the advanced features like in winedt you can try Kile
7/4/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Texworks is also already installed and configured on your laptop if you got the tue laptop
7/4/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That is a weird definition... But a variable A is nullable if A -> epsilon or A->X1 ... Xn where X1 to Xn are nullable
7/4/17, 19:44 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Ahh okay... thanks!
7/4/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What is nullable?
7/4/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: means it can result in the empty string
7/4/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: i think
7/4/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Definition is in the reader
7/4/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Okay thanks
7/4/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: do we have to be able to put a grammar in chomsky normal form?
7/4/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: probably
7/4/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: it has been discussed by the tutors
7/4/17, 20:02 - Bart van Dooren: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: I think it should be 3 colors
7/4/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Did they give notes about it? Since the notation used in the reader is terrible
7/4/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: the slides are quite clear
7/4/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: the ones from 17th of may
7/4/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It says nothing about theorem 3.35 and 3.36
7/4/17, 20:20 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: true but just the exercises of rewriting it because you should also be able to do the exercises mentioned in the planner
7/4/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: If u guys solve the questions can u upload them somewhere
7/4/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Why is the resit exam of 2016 so different than the other exams?
7/4/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: a^mb^m b^ma^m b^ma^m a^mb^m
7/4/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Is a lot more work
7/4/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Why not just only a's
7/4/17, 20:31 - Bas Gieling: how would you do that with only a's
7/4/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Vy can only pump 2 A's at the same time
7/4/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So the other 2a's would be in disbalance
7/4/17, 20:35 - Bas Gieling: why can they only pump 2 a's
7/4/17, 20:35 - Bas Gieling: they can pump up to m a's
7/4/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: They can't pump all 4 A's at the same time
7/4/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Two blocks of a's
7/4/17, 20:37 - Bas Gieling: a word consisting only of a's is in L if the amount of a's is divisible by 4
7/4/17, 20:37 - Bas Gieling: in this case
7/4/17, 20:37 - Bas Gieling: so "disbalance" of those blocks doesnt say too much
7/4/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You would get a^m+l a^m+l a^m a^m
7/4/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: And a few other cases
7/4/17, 20:38 - Bas Gieling: yea
7/4/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Then the first two
7/4/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Are in disbalance
7/4/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thus it is not in the language?
7/4/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Or am I thinking wrong?
7/4/17, 20:39 - Bas Gieling: = a^(4m+2l)
7/4/17, 20:39 - Bas Gieling: ^
7/4/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah so?
7/4/17, 20:39 - Bas Gieling: alright
7/4/17, 20:40 - Bas Gieling: aaaa is in L, right?
7/4/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah
7/4/17, 20:40 - Bas Gieling: so is aaaaaaaa
7/4/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ahhh I see now
7/4/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ffs I feel stupid
7/4/17, 20:40 - Bas Gieling: we can continue like this, and actually its the case that any word of only a's of which the amount of a's is divisible by 4 is in the language
7/4/17, 20:40 - Bas Gieling: haha aight
7/4/17, 20:40 - Bas Gieling: nah its pretty confusing to think about
7/4/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I need this child translation to understand it I'm sorry😂
7/4/17, 20:41 - Bas Gieling: and it sucks that we need to use those b's because its gonna be split up in different cases and its gonna be a mess
7/4/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah
7/4/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How would you write it down with the B's?
7/4/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Could you try it and maybe show a picture, that would be really nice🙄😬
7/4/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: intersection with the set of generating symbols
7/4/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: the whole blue part basically means the set of symbols that are in (the union of V and T)* and that are also generating symbols
7/4/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: and generating symbols are symbols that, after a certain amount of production rules, will product a string of only terminal symbols
7/4/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: so the symbols that are before the arrows in the production rules?
7/4/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: not sure whether this means all symbols on the right side of the arrow in the production rules
7/4/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 41131552‬ left
7/4/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: hmm
7/4/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: X can be a terminal or a variable, and it is generating if at some point after applying a certain number of production rules you end up with only terminal symbols.
7/4/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: B looks like one of them
7/4/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: S A B C D E right?
7/4/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: i would assume S A B D C D E
7/4/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: empty set counts or?
7/4/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: C and D not
7/4/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: why not c,d?
7/4/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: they loop
7/4/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah
7/4/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: c creates d and d creates c
7/4/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: i think
7/4/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: yeah i know they loop but that doesnt mean that a C wont product a string w of only terminals
7/4/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yeah i think it does
7/4/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: C has a D inside and D has a C inside
7/4/17, 21:00 - Bas Gieling: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: C will never produce a string solely consisting of terminals
7/4/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: how can C end with only terminals
7/4/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: oh
7/4/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: right, im dumb
7/4/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah i think they're also generating because indeed C has D but it adds A in front which means it can produce another kind of string
7/4/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but still it will never be all terminals
7/4/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: Yeah niels try to take a C, apply any production rule that you see and try to get a string consisting of ONLY terminals
7/4/17, 21:01 - Bas Gieling: i dont like the a^(m+l)b^(m+p) etc stuff, because it gives so many unnecessary cases, but the way i do it requires a longer explanation
7/4/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ooh I see you always have to fill in D which again contains C
7/4/17, 21:02 - Bas Gieling: im not even sure if the tutor is gonna give full points, but he should
7/4/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Should it not be vy
7/4/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Instead of vxy
7/4/17, 21:08 - Bas Gieling: i think you mean in the case explanation? i use uxy as a whole (and yea i accidentally switched u and v, whoops) so can say that the entire thing is in 1 block, and x does not contain all the b's in between the two blocks of a's (which it cant anyway, but the way i say it eliminates that chance in the first place)
7/4/17, 21:08 - Bas Gieling: it doesnt really matter, if uxy contains only a's then u and y both contain only a's as well
7/4/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 21:10 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: And I do not know how 5.2.5 is related to it
7/4/17, 21:12 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Would it have 8 steps?
7/4/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: States
7/4/17, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yes 2x2x2
7/4/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: you get 8 states combined of 3 of the original states
7/4/17, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: <Media omitted>
7/4/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Thank you 
But on what basis did you arrange the states like that ?? 
I know if they were 2 LTS then I put one LTS horizontally and the other vertically
7/4/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: One the computer systems basis
7/4/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: On
7/4/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ohhh like binary numbers
7/4/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Yeah kinda
7/4/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: But the shape should not matter
7/4/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: It just makes it easier to read
7/4/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Okay thank you so much !
7/4/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I'll see what I can do from here
7/4/17, 21:49 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Does anyone has a clear formulation of lemma 3.15b?
7/4/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: When can we expect the grades from USE?
7/4/17, 21:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: When they've finished grading it
7/4/17, 21:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: probably in 14 work days from now
7/4/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: But like aint after this week "work days" over? As in holiday for them?
7/4/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: You get very spoiled when the modeling results were in in 15 hours
7/4/17, 22:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 😀
7/4/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahah
7/4/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's the same machine they need to wait for with a cup of coffee
7/4/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would say it's nice for them to be done with that as well
7/4/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I hope they give it before automata
7/4/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would be good for motivation
7/4/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys, does anybody know who to contact when there is still a mistake in the results(Q2)
7/4/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I contacted them and they gave me right, but the points are not awarded
7/4/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Contact them again
7/4/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Keep spamming
7/4/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Perhaps just Bloo
7/4/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Is roel bloo in his office this week
7/4/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: U guys know ?
7/4/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'll go with you hakan
7/4/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: got some problems too
7/4/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wanna go tomorrow or smth?
7/4/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: According to the OER they have until 5 workdays after the exam weeks to return our grades
7/4/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: oh
7/4/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: But are there workdays after the exam weeks?  😬
7/4/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31614418848
7/4/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Sure
7/4/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Sounds like a date
7/4/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: But you gonna explain me automata
7/4/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Okay
7/4/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes, since those days aren't official festive days
7/4/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: deal
7/4/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: come sit with me and mart
7/4/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ill let you know
7/4/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: where well sit
7/4/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: De examinatoren stellen het eindcijfer van het tentamen van
onderwijseenheden op een zodanig moment vast dat uiterlijk binnen
vijftien werkdagen na afloop van de eindtoets het eindcijfer door de
onderwijsadministratie bekend wordt gemaakt in het systeem dat door
de TU/e wordt gebruikt (zie ook artikel 7.2, eerste lid). De
examinatoren maken het eindoordeel van een CA binnen 5 werkdagen
na de presentatie bekend aan de student
7/4/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: well shit
7/4/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Lees verder in art. 5.8.3
7/4/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ah ja
7/4/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ik zie t
7/4/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ik zocht al zoiets maar ik besloot niet verder te lezen dan 5.8.2
7/4/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Anne kent heel die nummers uit dr kop😂
7/4/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: vooral als het bestand op mijn computer open staat ja
7/4/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is het jouw wallpaper?
7/4/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Tuurlijk
7/4/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Maar, er staat dat het binnen 5 dagen na de eindtoetsenperiode is
7/4/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Dus dan zou het uiterlijk volgende week vrijdag zijn, rite?
7/4/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Idd
7/4/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: oh dan hebben ze nog wel ff
7/4/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oke, nvm
7/4/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ik was een beetje dommetjes
7/4/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: hihi
7/4/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Das wel ferm opzich
7/4/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Maar ze tyfen die zooi zo door de machine
7/4/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Want t zijn alleen MC vragen
7/4/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Klopt
7/4/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maar dan moeten ze daar wel naartoe lopen
7/4/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Dus ze kunnen die shit toch morgen gewoon uploaden?
7/4/17, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Als ze dan hun analyse van de vragen af hebben wel
7/4/17, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Ze willen denk ik kijken welke vragen ze der uit knikkeren
7/4/17, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Dat
7/4/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Of ze kijken vantevoren voor ze hem geven of de vragen goed zijn?
7/4/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Dat is 100 keer logischer dan na de examens kijken
7/4/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hebben we eigenlijk wel goede vragen gemaakt
7/4/17, 22:40 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: zoiets zie je toch niet
7/4/17, 22:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Oh ze kijken zeker of iedereen hem fout heeft?
7/4/17, 22:40 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Of goed
7/4/17, 22:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Dat zou toch prima zijn
7/5/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Who is going to the question hour?
7/5/17, 10:27 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: me
7/5/17, 10:27 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: where is it?

7/5/17, 10:31 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Which floor is mf 16, guys?
7/5/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: MF16 does not exist...
7/5/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: MF15 is floor 7 tho
7/5/17, 10:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: 15*
7/5/17, 10:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Thx
7/5/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys
7/5/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the proofs we need to know include proofs about parse trees
7/5/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but parse trees wouldnt be on the exam right?
7/5/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: whats with that?
7/5/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: is the course material for automata te same as in 2014?
7/5/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: for video lecture purposes
7/5/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I think it does
7/5/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I mean, they ARE in the proofs we should know
7/5/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so idk
7/5/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah that's weird
7/5/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: can someone whos in the question ask erik?
7/5/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because idk\
7/5/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: please..?
7/5/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: i don't think many people are there
7/5/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i saw people talking about where it was earlier
7/5/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so there must be people there who are active in this groupchat
7/5/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i.e. @31620885116 and @79853412264
7/5/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nvm i'll go myself
7/5/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31643157069 where did you find those automata exams bij vink again?
7/5/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: at his website
7/5/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: which is linked on canvas

7/5/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: take the interime example and remove the pdf name from the url
7/5/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: then you get to his site
7/5/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/2it70/
7/5/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and then?

7/5/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ?
7/5/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: this was not even directed to me
7/5/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: at me*
7/5/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: LOL
7/5/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: hahahahaha
7/5/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: this was for max
7/5/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but can you confirm they are vinks
7/5/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: then max has his answer
7/5/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ye they are haha
7/5/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks babes
7/5/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 🐢😉
7/5/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: What about parse trees?
7/5/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: what about 5.3 and 5.4? we have to do those?
7/5/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: No
7/5/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys
7/5/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: when applying the pumping lemma for CFL's, is it allowed to keep an arbitrary m, but pick u,v,x,y,z and k>=0 yourself and show that it doesnt hold for the chosen values of u,v,x,y,z
7/5/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ?
7/5/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: *and k
7/5/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk if it means there exists a distribution for w=uvxyz or for all distributions for w=uvxyz
7/5/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: any ideas?
7/5/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: please?
7/5/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: showing that it does not work for a specific configuration of w in the language is enough to show that the language is not context-free
7/5/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright, so the m should stay arbitrary but you can show it for one specific case of the distribution of uvxyz?
7/5/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: no it should not work for any distribution of uvxyz
7/5/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: but you can choose w
7/5/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: You pick a w and then prove for all possible cases that there is an i for which it is not in the language
7/5/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ah okay
7/5/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so the only thing you can choose is w, but now how w is distributed in uvxyz
7/5/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ?
7/5/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: yes
7/5/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You change the amount of iterations in the pumping
7/5/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: it should not work for any distribution
7/5/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: so the uv^i x y^i z
7/5/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: just using i = 0 or i = 2 will do
7/5/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah, but i cannot choose my u v x y and z myself?
7/5/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: you can
7/5/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: well
7/5/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: you don't choose it yourself
7/5/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: you need to prove it for all the cases
7/5/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah alright
7/5/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: rip
7/5/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: so when you have a^m b^m
7/5/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: you need to prove it for v = a and y = a, v = a, y = b, v = b y = b
7/5/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: oh that doesnt look super clear
7/5/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: but i hope you get what i meant
7/5/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah
7/5/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i get that
7/5/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
7/5/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so did we get any clarification on the wight of the automata grades? Since on canvas it says 20% 20% for the interim and programming assignment, but on osirirs it is 20% interim and 10% programming
7/5/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: wel its not 20% 10% its a weird number that I cannot derive in any way using my results for the assignment and the midterm
7/5/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: im pretty sure its already half half... they just need to change the 30%
7/5/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: mine is 50/50
7/5/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: mine is not...
7/5/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: it's lower
7/5/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: oh that sucks
7/5/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: wait let me check my midterm grade
7/5/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i have a 3.0 and a 9.6
7/5/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: that should be a 6.3 right?
7/5/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Yes
7/5/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Well fuck that
7/5/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: who should I mail
7/5/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Vink?
7/5/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: probably
7/5/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Yeah it's 50/50, I got a 1.0 and a 10.0, got a 5.5

7/5/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: theyre probably never gonna ask for a proof of the pumping lemma
7/5/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ...i think
7/5/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Are there any solutions for practice exams?
7/5/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dont think so
7/5/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: they did in the resit of last year...
7/5/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: The thing is that the proof assumed that you start with the smallest parse tree that produces w
7/5/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: If ppl upload the solutions they think are correct
7/5/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Would be awesome guys
7/5/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Pls
7/5/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: shit
7/5/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: yea, he will probably do more difficult stuff in the resit
7/5/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: And if vy is empty, then that certain part of the tree will also produce w
7/5/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: thats what vink said in the lecture
7/5/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: He said he makes resits harder?
7/5/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 2 is tobin
7/5/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: So you go from left to right i assume?
7/5/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: he said something along the lines that resits have more difficult proofs
7/5/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you can decide for yourself unless its stated that you should do the right or left most first
7/5/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: theres a name for thath
7/5/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but in 1 you do two steps in one steps
7/5/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and thats not allowed
7/5/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Okay thats what i  wanted to knwo
7/5/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Thanks!
7/5/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no prob
7/5/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: cutie
7/5/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Rawr xD
7/5/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: but that does not mean that vy can not be empty?
7/5/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 15:45 - Bas Gieling: wut
7/5/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I dont think so
7/5/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no
7/5/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because v and w are not in T
7/5/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: they are strings containing elements of T
7/5/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you only define the R of G
7/5/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you need to define T and V too
7/5/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and S
7/5/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: What>
7/5/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: ?
7/5/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: a CFG is stated as: G = (V, T, R, S)
7/5/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you state only the R of this CFG
7/5/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, okay
7/5/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But is the production rule okay?
7/5/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no, it is not
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you use the v and the w as if they are in T
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Why would you need a CFG for that?
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but they are not
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Because it is not?
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the T of this CFG is {a,b}
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you act as if it is {v,w}
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, but does that matter?
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thats not correct
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yes it does
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because v and w are not in T
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, because you don't know the v and the w?
7/5/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: they are strings consisting of elements in a and b
7/5/17, 15:48 - Bas Gieling: how do those rules produce that language
7/5/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: there isn't a cfg?
7/5/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you cannot use them in your production rules if they are not in V or T
7/5/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: V and w are no terminals tick
7/5/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ugh, fuck this subject so hard
7/5/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Rick*
7/5/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: cmon rick
7/5/17, 15:49 - Bas Gieling: its not a context free language, so you dont need to look for a grammar
7/5/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: There is no CFG for it
7/5/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Why do they need to make everything needlessly complicted
7/5/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: *complicated
7/5/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You should pove there isn't a cfg @31642623926
7/5/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, ill do that then
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I dont think they'll ever ask something where it's actually context free
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Fucking fuck fuck fuck
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: because having to derive the contradiction is just harder
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Will they screw us by taking one that is a CFG?
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I hate Erik Vink with every fibre in my body
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sure hope not
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: +1
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: i dont think so sander
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No clue how to do that lol
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: might be
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: in 3.2 they explain how to prove L(G) = L
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Since we always seem to get screwed over
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so they could do that
7/5/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lol true sander
7/5/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Anyone has the answers for the example exam 14 June 2017 assignment 3?
7/5/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I got some, yes
7/5/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But idk how correct they are
7/5/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: My certainty about 3a is about 90% tho
7/5/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Still would be a great help
7/5/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Where can i find this
7/5/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: on cs students
7/5/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oki thnx
7/5/17, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You only need the top left part for your answer
7/5/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: A second year student checked this for me, and he said that you also need the "disconnected" part
7/5/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Why, it isn't reachable
7/5/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 👆🏻
7/5/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I also never write the unreachable parts
7/5/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, he said it has to...
7/5/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But idk of course
7/5/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Did he fail automata?
7/5/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope, passed with a 7...
7/5/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If you should also use the unreachable part then they had to mention it somewhere in the reader
7/5/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Reader also skips the unreachable parts
7/5/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then imma do it without the unreachable part
7/5/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Vink also did it without unreachable parts, if that means anything
7/5/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, then imma do it without as well
7/5/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: So if rick never had asked an other student then we couldnt have known to use it
7/5/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: But then my next question i got the same for a but i wont come out with the coloring thingy
7/5/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm, you should use the Tau-I thingy
7/5/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Like convert all the a's, because those are in I, to a tau-step
7/5/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I have that but then i still get different colors for the 2 lst
7/5/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ill show mine
7/5/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If i see correct then you can ignore the tau relation
7/5/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes, you can ignore it under certain circumstances
7/5/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But I am not really sure about what those were again...
7/5/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Then i see what i did wrong
7/5/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Thnx will look them up
7/5/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk if we should trust rick's answers, he answered the second questions of the example exam with a grammar only consisting of production rules which used elements out side of V and T
7/5/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If that tau step connects two with the same color
7/5/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Idk if we should trust Maxes answers, he does not know where to find basic TU/e stuff
7/5/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Max saying Rick's answers cannot be trusted. How things have changed throughout the year...
7/5/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Jeez man, what's up with the personal attacks today
7/5/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahahaha
7/5/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't like the way you sit on a chair Rick
7/5/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I expected an answer more like "idk if we should trust max, he's from limburg"
7/5/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: since that seems to be your only personal offense you could think of against me prior to today
7/5/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but today, we see great growth in rick's diss game
7/5/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait is there an actual feud going on here or are you both being cynical dicks?
7/5/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i was being a cynical dick lol
7/5/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dont have beef with rick
7/5/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: love you rick
7/5/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this exam stress is just really getting to me
7/5/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: You dont have to write down the branching relation in this question right?
7/5/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Or is this another question?
7/5/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Its that one
7/5/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Yeah so the branching relation rick wrote down is not necessary right?
7/5/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Since it is not asked?
7/5/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is the same, but I was unsure about how to prove the relation otherwise
7/5/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Is saying "both LTS have the same color for initial state and the same amoutn of colors, so they are bisimilar" not sufficient?
7/5/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm, could be I guess?
7/5/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: same set of colors, not necessary the same amount of colors
7/5/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: whats the exact difference between the two?
7/5/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Well if the one on this picture is colored with color 1 and 2, and the one you drew with color 3 and 4, in the same table, after they stabilized, they don't have colors in the same set
7/5/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Pumping lemma for cfg
7/5/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: excuse me?
7/5/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: ah okay, thanks you!
7/5/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: The requirement of L to be context free is that the pumping lemma holds
7/5/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yes, that is true indeed
7/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how does the pumping lemma not hold if v and y dont contain c's though
7/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Cuz v and y are the only parts you can pump up
7/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yes that is true indeed
7/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so what?
7/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i can still pump a's and b's
7/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: So if it doesnt contain any c's then the amount of c's are always the same for every string in L
7/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yes
7/5/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: So m is constant
7/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no
7/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: m will not be constant
7/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because i pump a's and b's
7/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: or do you mean the number of c'' m
7/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: c's
7/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: M doenst have anything to do with a's and b's
7/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah okay you mean the number of c's
7/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah alright
7/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Yes
7/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but why does that matter?
7/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: U will have more as and bs if u pump only a and b
7/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: And that isn't ambmcm
7/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ohhhhhh
7/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but wait
7/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: why is that a problem
7/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you just choose w to be ambmcm
7/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: That's not part of the language
7/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but the result after pumping should only be in L
7/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yes it is
7/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Of v and y only contain a's and b's, you can pump up as much as you like. But if you pump _down_, so pick i=0, it might not work
7/5/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the language states anblcm
7/5/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thank you. this is what i was looking for
7/5/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that explains
7/5/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks hugo
7/5/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ah ye
7/5/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Then just pump it down
7/5/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: And u will get n, l < m
7/5/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Or whatever
7/5/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah thanks for clarifying john i didnt get that when hugo said it
7/5/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: im sassy today im sorry
7/5/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ah no problem max
7/5/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Give him some chill, the middle east is just recently discovering the dark ages anyway
7/5/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Joh is way ahead
7/5/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ikr daan thanks
7/5/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no
7/5/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its the same
7/5/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because q2 equals the q2 witht he hat
7/5/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its the same
7/5/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: hm okay
7/5/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: thanks
7/5/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because D cannot take tao transitions
7/5/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: tau* @31642623926
7/5/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: okay
7/5/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: are there answers to the sample exams on the cs students website? Am i blind or aren't they there?
7/5/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: there are none
7/5/17, 16:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: when they ask us to formulate the pumping lemma do they care if we formulate the negative or the normal one?
7/5/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I hate the courses that do this and i just don't get it
7/5/17, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: negative?
7/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Probably just the normal one
7/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But they are equivalent, so both should be considered correct
7/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Why can't I rewatch lectures on the videolectures website, even though I have the correct programs installed ? Someone else has this problem ?
7/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: they accepted both on the interi
7/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: m
7/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: not sure for this one
7/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah i had that too
7/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: papa bless
7/5/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: have*
7/5/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Do you have a fix for it ?:/
7/5/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Use internet explorer
7/5/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: And it might be easier to use the negative one, so that you don't have to rewrite it when you prove that a language is not context-free
7/5/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: And have silverlight installed
7/5/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Alright I'll try that, thanks
7/5/17, 16:52 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yeah that's why i asked because the b part of exercise 2 is usualy not context free so it would save some time if we can use the negative one in a
7/5/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Vink told today you can write the negative one
7/5/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: So its confirmed
7/5/17, 16:52 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ah nice
7/5/17, 16:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: btw why is it ok that the same subject has 2 different exam types in q2 and q4 .... that's so ... i don't even know what to call it ? RETARDED!
7/5/17, 16:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It is so for us because we have already learnt data structures
7/5/17, 16:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: They assume knowledge we got makes it easier for us to understand hard proofs etc
7/5/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: can't log in on internet explorer... wth
7/5/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Zwaan said Q2 is 'bezemvariant', thay used to give the same version in both quartiles but decided to change the subject some years ago
7/5/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Dont use internet explorer then lol
7/5/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: chrome and edge won't let me watch the video lectures though, even though i have the right software installed
7/5/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: And then you can't watch the videos :P
7/5/17, 16:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: that is supposed to explain the difficulty difference in q4 as ooposed to q2?
7/5/17, 17:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i guess no
7/5/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Video lectures?
7/5/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Yeah the video lectures of a couple years back
7/5/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Weird glitch, but what fixes it for me is: dont browse to the vid, use the search bar
7/5/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Then click it
7/5/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And it should work
7/5/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No clue how or why
7/5/17, 17:02 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Q1 is hard, other ones (?)
7/5/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Give it a shot id say
7/5/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: In chrome that is
7/5/17, 17:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Andrei what on earth are you saying ? :D
7/5/17, 17:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can someone give me their approach to learning how to do 1 and 2 ?
7/5/17, 17:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: like what did you do to prepare
7/5/17, 17:04 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: For pumping lemma just learn answers for exercises and examples
7/5/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: The bottom right is the final answer
7/5/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Should we be able do to that?
7/5/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I guess so it's in chapter 3
7/5/17, 17:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: 90% it won't be a part of exam
7/5/17, 17:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It will be about applying pumping lemma
7/5/17, 17:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: From chapter 3
7/5/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh okay
7/5/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So just to be sure like Jort always tells us, don't bother looking at it
7/5/17, 17:08 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You can learn it tho if you have extra time
7/5/17, 17:08 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Just to be safe
7/5/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Extra time
7/5/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Pff
7/5/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But you could also spend that extra time doing something less useful
7/5/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Difficult decision
7/5/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Your ε-elimination went wrong. You are supposed to "push" all ε's up to S so that only S->ε (and not A->ε). Then you get for the second bar from the top that S->AAA|AA|aA|a|ε and A->aA|a. Answer is at the end of the reader btw.
7/5/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Can it be that ε∈Δ or is that impossible?
7/5/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah I was doubting if it was allowed to let S produce epsilon
7/5/17, 17:24 - Bart van Dooren: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 17:24 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Reversed
7/5/17, 17:25 - Bart van Dooren: Aaaaahh that makes sence thanks 😁
7/5/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: epsilon in always in all sets
7/5/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so yes, that is possible
7/5/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Ah ok, thanks!
7/5/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: here it doesnt say that u ,v,x,y,z are elemnt of epsilon but is it still okay
7/5/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: the alpahebt i mean
7/5/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: U,v,x,y,z are in w and w is in L
7/5/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: okay
7/5/17, 17:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i think because w is in epsilon and since uvxyz are part of w you don't have to mention
7/5/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And L is in Sigma*
7/5/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah sigma
7/5/17, 17:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oops sorry i didn't see that its already answered
7/5/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: thank u
7/5/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: So transitivity
7/5/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: epsilon is empty
7/5/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so it will always be in all possible sets
7/5/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: since all sets, even the empty set, contains the empty symbol
7/5/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah okay i didnt study to my greek lessons
7/5/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i meant the other symbol
7/5/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: well i didnt take greek either
7/5/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ohhh
7/5/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: sorry i didnt read that message in context
7/5/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: sorry 😅
7/5/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: D: np
7/5/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Think it is enough to say they have the same color thus are bisimilar
7/5/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: No
7/5/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Also give the relations
7/5/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: So R
7/5/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: And what about when they ask if two LTS are branching bisimilar?
7/5/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Then it is enough to say the initial states have the same color?
7/5/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Colour, show relations, conclusion
7/5/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Dude what if you have a LTS with 10 states
7/5/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Then you get a full page of R
7/5/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: then Vink like's to pop your cherry
7/5/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I discussed an LTS assignment with zwaan today
7/5/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Zwaan =\ Vink🤔
7/5/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 😂😂
7/5/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah, but i guess vink is the one that is only gonna make your life more difficult
7/5/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: so yeah..
7/5/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: That their tests are different does not mean that the guy is a Retard in his subject

7/5/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: He kinda is tho
7/5/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: @31631192870  Do you also happen to have the answers to that question? that would help me out a lot :)
7/5/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Why are there still people not using screenshots haha
7/5/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Only to b
7/5/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it should just be enough to say that the colours are the same right
7/5/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Because I'm not on web whatsapp
7/5/17, 17:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: feel free to be a good Samaritan and post your thing here johny boi

7/5/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Can I also omit a proof?
7/5/17, 17:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: or here?!

7/5/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: The R thingy u have to complete urself
7/5/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: thanks man, you're  a life saver!
7/5/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Np
7/5/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I wrote the R thingy next to it ;/
7/5/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: It's open for discussion so if u see mistakes just tell me
7/5/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ye I don't see it
7/5/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No me neither
7/5/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: O
7/5/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: That answer of mine
7/5/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Is from a different question
7/5/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is for this question
7/5/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: <Media omitted>

7/5/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: should I take m = 2 so that |w| can never be equal to m? Or am I missing something
7/5/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: The thing is that |vxy| <= m, and there are m b's between the a's and the c's
7/5/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: So vxy, can't contain a's as well as c's
7/5/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: oh right
7/5/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I see thanks
7/5/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but wait then vxy cannot contain a's and b's since then the length |vxy| = 2m
7/5/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: which is not <= m
7/5/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It can contain both, because the a's and b's are next to each other
7/5/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: oh wait
7/5/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you can have a^(m-5) as your x of course
7/5/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah, I guess
7/5/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yeah yeah I understand even if you dont; undrrstand me
7/5/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: thanks H U G O ❤
7/5/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Lol
7/5/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: There was at least one exam where they explicitly said that you should give the bisimilarity relation. So I wouldn't be surprised if it's not necessary if it's not stated
7/5/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: The relation can be deducted from the coloring scheme too right ?
7/5/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah
7/5/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Same colors in the cfinal
7/5/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It's all possible combinations of two states with the same colour
7/5/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Coloring
7/5/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: And even if it might not be necessary, it's not very difficult once you have the colouring scheme
7/5/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ye
7/5/17, 19:03 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: How do you prove that there is no bisimillarity by coloring scheme?
7/5/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: When they do not have the same color in the final colouring, when applied to bisimilarity of LTS's
7/5/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Talking sbout the initial states
7/5/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 45422140‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Guess so
7/5/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yes
7/5/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Lol Is pumping actually a verb they use
7/5/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I pump you
7/5/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Oh, pump off
7/5/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Dont they first pump with 0 and then with 2 or more?
7/5/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Since they say a strictly smaller
7/5/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: And thats not true if they pump that second time with 0 as well
7/5/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah, for the second part they go up
7/5/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But they could pick i=0 again I think
7/5/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 45422140‬: okay thank you :)

7/5/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: No
7/5/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It means it's not homeless
7/5/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Why do they use it then
7/5/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: fucking retarded course
7/5/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Cuz great banter
7/5/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: To differ from some w used elsewhere
7/5/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Anyone mind explaining me why it is not context free?
7/5/17, 20:43 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Open reader
7/5/17, 20:44 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: There is an example with exact same thing
7/5/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I cannot see such an example
7/5/17, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: 3.57
7/5/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: thats not the same question?
7/5/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It is
7/5/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: if you take u,x and z to be ε, and you take v and y to be ¯w¯
7/5/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ?
7/5/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ?
7/5/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: what is not clear about that
7/5/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: w = w'w' (w' being that weird w)
7/5/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: then w = uvxyz
7/5/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: u = ε
v = w'
x = ε
y = w'
z = ε
7/5/17, 20:51 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: that weird w is just a w
7/5/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: that not how taht works
7/5/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: you can't just do that
7/5/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: thats how they did it in the examples from the book 😔
7/5/17, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: idk wtf to do then
7/5/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: pick w = a^m b^m a ^m b^m where a^m b^m is the weird w
7/5/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: this?
7/5/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: that is 3.56 for me I just found out
7/5/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but why cant w be aba for example
7/5/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: why does it have to be in the form aaaabbbb
7/5/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: can
7/5/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: do you have to prove it for all cases then?
7/5/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: no need to overcomplicate
7/5/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: and just provide one case where it doesnt work?
7/5/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: all cases for 1 string
7/5/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i guess
7/5/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: jup
7/5/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: so the trick is to pick the right string
7/5/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: but you can see that it can be done in like 5 lines
7/5/17, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: by just saying what you are doing with v and y, and then just show the strings after u did that
7/5/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: okay but how do you show a language is context free
7/5/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: provide a grammar
7/5/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: because I can just take a random string for which this would work
7/5/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: go ahead
7/5/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: so give those production rules
7/5/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: which is different from proving it tho
7/5/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: But what I mean is
7/5/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you said I have to find the right string to prove a language is not cotnext free
7/5/17, 20:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but how do I know if such a string even exists
7/5/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: well pick one with something to the power m
7/5/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: since vwy <= m
7/5/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Pick 3!!
7/5/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: so you know that the vwy only covers at most 2 different kind of variables
7/5/17, 20:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: 99% you have to prove language is not context free
7/5/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: isnt it vxy?
7/5/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: true
7/5/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: typo
7/5/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thats what i did yes
7/5/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ye
7/5/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Okay then it must be a good approach
7/5/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: lemme try this and see if i can figure it out
7/5/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: sure
7/5/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: thanks for trying to help this hopeless case
7/5/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ill send you my proof
7/5/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I feel you
7/5/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: i have the same
7/5/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: send proofs
7/5/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I still don't really understand how it works and how to write it down
7/5/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Can there be proofs/answers uploaded to CS-students😊
7/5/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 🤗🤗
7/5/17, 21:20 - Bart van Dooren: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 21:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Those can contain multiple symbols belonging to alphabet
7/5/17, 21:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Like if alphabet is a,b
v for example can be abbaab
7/5/17, 21:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: As far as I get it, but I am not 100% sure tho
7/5/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Kleene closure
7/5/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yeah it means it's string
7/5/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: with elements of the alphabet
7/5/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Indeed. Say Σ={a,b} then Σ*={a,b}*={ε,a,b,aa,ab,ba,bb,aab,...}
7/5/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Imagine *'s around the bold part 😔
7/5/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: <Media omitted>
7/5/17, 21:29 - Bart van Dooren: Thanks, now i get 😁
7/5/17, 21:29 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: As far as I know it wasn't showed
7/5/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It is explained in theorem 3.35 and 3.36
7/5/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: But those have the most terrible notation of all theorems
7/5/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yeah haha
7/5/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: the theorems only have the proof and not really a method or is it somewhere hidden in the terrible notation?
7/5/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: hidden
7/5/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: noice
7/5/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: well thanks!
7/5/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The chance they will ask this is probably very small
7/5/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: true
7/5/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: I believe he said they wouldn'y
7/5/17, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: But don't quote me on that
7/5/17, 21:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: "I believe he said they wouldn'y" - Mels
7/5/17, 21:52 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: 🖕🖕

7/5/17, 22:08 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Ahahhahahahah
7/5/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: no but for real tho
7/5/17, 22:08 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Non reachable states are excluded I suppose
7/5/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Jort drew it out today
7/5/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: All 49 states
7/5/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: yeah but they are reachable tho
7/5/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: right
7/5/17, 22:09 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Idk then but something that has no chances to come on the actual exam
7/5/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: lol yeah this is simply too much right
7/5/17, 22:09 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Vink is a douche about proofs but not regular tasks
7/5/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: this one is aids indeed, drew it out, only worked slightly
7/5/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but you don't need it as you can't reach S10 from the start state
7/5/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah I saw after looking for 3 hours
7/5/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I think I tried to do that exercise at some point, but I gave up pretty quickly
7/5/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: grid of 49 states is not satisfying when crammed on A4 paper
7/5/17, 23:06 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Btw, I would recommend to remember base cases for every proof in case the one you haven't learnt comes on exam
7/5/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you can pretty much make that up on the spot though
7/5/17, 23:06 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Just to get some points
7/5/17, 23:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: True
7/5/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Well the base cases are usually simple
7/5/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Probs
7/5/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Will be like 5 points I guess
7/5/17, 23:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Still something
7/5/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah
7/5/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That's 0.5
7/5/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah, it's easy points
7/5/17, 23:08 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Cause I don't believe that there are many ppl who actually learnt every goo damn proof
7/5/17, 23:08 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: That's barely possible
7/5/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: The proofs are all pretty similar though
7/5/17, 23:09 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: That's why they mix with one another in my head
7/5/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hmm I will look into them tomorrow
7/5/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How many are there?
7/5/17, 23:13 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: 12
7/5/17, 23:14 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Some imply two directions of proof
7/5/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What does that mean tho?
7/5/17, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How can you go the other side?
7/5/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: if you know your induction you can 'build' it on the exam
7/5/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: the theorem is a bi-implication so you need a proof for both ways sander
7/5/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: GL, i tried and i am definatly not capable of it
7/5/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That works, combined with memorizing parts that you don't see a lot in other proofs
7/5/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I try and combine it with the fact I can get a 6 by some pumping and colouring
7/5/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: so that'll be suffiecient
7/5/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 6.5 including base case
7/5/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: at most*
7/6/17, 00:00 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Welcome to the club
7/6/17, 00:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: same
7/6/17, 00:03 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lets just hope they dont screw us with the pumping lemma
7/6/17, 00:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait do tell that .5 haha
7/6/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I need everything I can get
7/6/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: base case on question 1a
7/6/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ah right
7/6/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks ;
7/6/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ;p
7/6/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: might be a portion of the total points
7/6/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It should be
7/6/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i dont know their grading scheme but it sounds logical yes
7/6/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I hope so
7/6/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Like daan said
7/6/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Need everything i can gsrt here
7/6/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Get
7/6/17, 09:13 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: does someone know which slide are about ePDA's
7/6/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Whats an ePDA?
7/6/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: an e-Push Down Automata
7/6/17, 09:18 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: a pda that halts on an empty stack
7/6/17, 09:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ha ha ha
7/6/17, 09:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Doesnt a pda always only hold on an empty sta?ck
7/6/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Stack?*
7/6/17, 09:33 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: no
7/6/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: regular PDA's have halting states
7/6/17, 09:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 👆🏽
7/6/17, 09:50 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 09:50 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Like (01,02) I mean
7/6/17, 09:51 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Or do we only have to write the relations between the 2 different LTS's
7/6/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: add the relations inside the state as well yah
7/6/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but V's related to a lot more states right
7/6/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: do you have to leave states that can not be reached in an LTS? or should they be removed?
7/6/17, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Wait, do we have to write down those relations?
7/6/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: What are they for?
7/6/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I didn't know about doing that
7/6/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You dont know a lot of things joost 😏
7/6/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But
7/6/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Relations are only needed for proving the similarity thingy lts
7/6/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not sure what its caled
7/6/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Called
7/6/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And thats just as far as i know, so no guarantees lel
7/6/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Nicely said @31643470096
7/6/17, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Very clear
7/6/17, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: bisimulation relations
7/6/17, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: ayy
7/6/17, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That one yis
7/6/17, 10:27 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Thanks for the confirmation @31643470096
7/6/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: you sure? in the reader they only pick the ones between the two LTSs ... to show the bisimilarity between the two
7/6/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no I'm not sure.. just thought that would be more complete
7/6/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: to prove bisimilarity you dont need to write the relations in the LTS
7/6/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and if you do it, its not that much more work and they'll never say its wrong
7/6/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: just the states that are related between the two
7/6/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: jup
7/6/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: They might say its wrong max
7/6/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: because technically those relations are not part of the bisimulation relation
7/6/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: and i have a feeling this exam is gonna be full of ant fuckery
7/6/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: so
7/6/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: im pretty sure
7/6/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: do you have to leave states that can not be reached in an LTS? or should they be removed?
7/6/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: A string gamma can produce w in a CFG, if and only if the corresponding PDA can go from (q1, gamma, w) to (q1, empty, empty)
7/6/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: it's easier to take them out
7/6/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: saves you work
7/6/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but you may leave them in
7/6/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I understand but why is there an L on top?
7/6/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: so it is allowed to do both?
7/6/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yes
7/6/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Oh, it's a leftmost production
7/6/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but colouring will suck if you leave them in
7/6/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Why? @31621372984  it only has one state with the same color
7/6/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: So you only ever use production rules on the leftmost variable
7/6/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Ahh okay
7/6/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thanks!
7/6/17, 10:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck me youre right
7/6/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i was looking at the first iteration
7/6/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh okay nice then for 1 time I did an automata question right
7/6/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Congratz Niels
7/6/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Lol rip niels

7/6/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: It says you may assume theorems to be proven unless they specifically ask you to proof everything... basically you may use proofs from the reader to proof
7/6/17, 10:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Oh, okay
Thanks !
7/6/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Name of the victim has been censored to the public I see
7/6/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Even though it says 'Isabelle' in Vink's email
7/6/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: 😂
7/6/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ikr
7/6/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: her full name was there
7/6/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: and she did not want that
7/6/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: all first letters and last name
7/6/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Rip now I can't Facebook stalk
7/6/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: hahahaha
7/6/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: does someone have the proof of 1b july 2016?
7/6/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: What theorem?
7/6/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 11:05 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: But it's in reader
7/6/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Hmm don't they have it in the theorems and lemma pdf?
7/6/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: oh ja
7/6/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: It had the answer to b for 3.52
7/6/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: i see but it is awfully written
7/6/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: This I think
7/6/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thanks!
7/6/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: they stabilized and have some colors the same, so those states are branching bisimilar i guess
7/6/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Only the first states have the same colour tho and p2 and q2
7/6/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 34273312‬: The second half of the table is wrong
7/6/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 34273312‬: it is from a different excercise
7/6/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 34273312‬: I believe the one before that
7/6/17, 11:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh
7/6/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Because for to LSTs to be bisimilar, the initial states have to be bisimilar too right?
7/6/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Whch is not the case here
7/6/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 34273312‬: indeed
7/6/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Do we look at only the initial cases
7/6/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 34273312‬: but that excercise is bisimilar
7/6/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 34273312‬: only the table is wrong
7/6/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, I did the one before, didnt work out this one
7/6/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So I was confused
7/6/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks !
7/6/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Also which color column do we look at c1 or c2
7/6/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Or does it matter
7/6/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 34273312‬: np
7/6/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Because both have 3 colours
7/6/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is there a difference between these two?
7/6/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Yeah
7/6/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: What's the difference lol?
7/6/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah whats the difference
7/6/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Look in the definition of bisimulation relation
7/6/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Then you see the difference between R(q,p) and R(p,q)
7/6/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i mean on the contrary you could just.. tell us?
7/6/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: ah okay. Yeah I have not looked into that
7/6/17, 11:35 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Also in cartesian product axb does not equal to bxa
7/6/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Well, it is literally the definition: If R(q,p) and there is a transition labeled α from q to q', then there is a transition labeled α from p to p' such that R(q',p'). For R(p,q), switch all the p and q in the previous sentence.
7/6/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hmm seems kinda the same to me tbh
7/6/17, 11:36 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dont really see the practical difference
7/6/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wait, nvm
7/6/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: its an implication
7/6/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the normal relation is =>
7/6/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but when you write down both
7/6/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you get <=>
7/6/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight i see
7/6/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: the coloring algorithm terminates when the number of colors assigned in a coloring is the same as the amount of colors assigned in the last coloring isn't it?
7/6/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks!
7/6/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: There isn't any difference, but both hold
7/6/17, 11:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i believe so yes
7/6/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Since also: If R(q,p) and there is a transition labeled α from p to p', then there is a transition labeled α from q to q' such that R(q',p'). For R(p,q), switch all the p and q in the previous sentence.

7/6/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thats to demonstrate that it doesnt change
7/6/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Therefore you have to write down both
7/6/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: aha
7/6/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thats just an example to show that you should stop earlier guus
7/6/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: welp my wifi didnt work lol
7/6/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Do you guys have a good approach on drawing the ∂H(A || B || C) LTSs?
7/6/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Just the same as with 2 LTSs
7/6/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But it seems like my A || B || C becomes enormous
7/6/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yes
7/6/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But you will never get a big one on the exam
7/6/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Will take way too much time
7/6/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah alright, then I probably was doing the right thing, just didnt have enough patience lol
7/6/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah haah
7/6/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Copy it
7/6/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Just add a tau step in your LTS from every state where the state of Q is 1 to every state where the state of Q is 0
7/6/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: In the new lts
7/6/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Like you do with any other letter
7/6/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: ok, thanks guys :)
7/6/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Yes, but for b you have to change somethings in the lts
7/6/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: huh? what then? the state in p isn't supposed to change right? and it only goes from 1 to 2
7/6/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: or do you mean for question b?
7/6/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: question b
7/6/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Sorry :/
7/6/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: oh ok haha
7/6/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah only remove the b and c steps right?
7/6/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: well not remove
7/6/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: but replace them by taus?
7/6/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Jep
7/6/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I'm slowely but surely getting more confident about actually passing this shit
7/6/17, 12:45 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: thanks for the help :)
7/6/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: does it matter if tau steps go to different colors? do they also get different colors or the same one?
7/6/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If they go to different colors they matter
7/6/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: alright, thanks :)
7/6/17, 12:55 - Bas Gieling: if they go to the same colour as the current state you should write them in parentheses
7/6/17, 12:55 - Bas Gieling: and for the colouring only consider the transitions outside the parentheses
7/6/17, 12:56 - Bas Gieling: i only mean the tau-steps by this
7/6/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: but if you start with a lot of tau steps they always go to the same color right?, or can you also take them out of the parantheses again if that changes?
7/6/17, 12:58 - Bas Gieling: i dont understand what you mean :p yeah, in the first iteration of the colouring all tau steps go to colour 0, and they all are written in parentheses, but at later iterations you may find that a tau step brings a state from colour 4 to colour 3 for example, and then in that particular iteration you write tau/3 outside of parentheses
7/6/17, 12:59 - Bas Gieling: if i understood your question correctly ^
7/6/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah i think so
7/6/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I'll finish the exercise and then if you wouldn't mind checking for me I'd be grateful haha
7/6/17, 13:00 - Bas Gieling: yea i dont mind :p i just did the same exercise so we can compare
7/6/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: ok, great :)
7/6/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: may you only write transitions in the table from states reached by inert tau steps. Or may these steps also be done from states that are not bisimilar to the original state?
7/6/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Was there an automata summary?
7/6/17, 13:11 - Bas Gieling: i dont think so, hold on
7/6/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: rip me xd
7/6/17, 13:13 - Bas Gieling: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yes, search for 'summary' in this chat and you ll find it
7/6/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Alright thanks
7/6/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: np
7/6/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I think i just suck a lot because I miss a lot of a steps, i guess i got distracted while making those transitions...
7/6/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: let me get back at you in a while...
7/6/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: to *
7/6/17, 13:16 - Bas Gieling: i think so, the first one
7/6/17, 13:16 - Bas Gieling: the reader at least doesnt write down the transitions that follow after non-inert tau steps
7/6/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: so if you by means of tau steps a state with a color that is different from the color of the state that is considered, and from this state (with a different color) an a transition is done, then this a transition may not be written in the table?
7/6/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I think it may
7/6/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Pretty sure
7/6/17, 13:19 - Bas Gieling: youre right
7/6/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: No wait, i think  mine is correct? what does your LTS at a look like? this difference is weird
7/6/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Cause it is still a transition you can do from that starting state
7/6/17, 13:19 - Bas Gieling: at least, example 5.17 does it like this
7/6/17, 13:19 - Bas Gieling: have a look at example 5.17
7/6/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Sure in a few mins

7/6/17, 13:21 - Bas Gieling: after taking an inert tau step (one you write in parentheses) youre allowed to take more steps, so from state 01 you can take a tau step to state 02 and then an a-step to state 13, so you get a/0, (tau/0)
7/6/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: You have tau 0 and tau 1, but they are silent
7/6/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Only tau 3 isnt silent
7/6/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i know but why dont we write the silent one
7/6/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: with paranthesis
7/6/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You should
7/6/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I think they were lazy
7/6/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: They have no effect in the coloring scheme
7/6/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: okay
7/6/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: really? fuck that makes this a lot more complicated (but you can only do that when you have tau steps in between parentheses right?
7/6/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: still id like to wwrite them
7/6/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: We
7/6/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I don't think this is truee
7/6/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Oh nvm
7/6/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That is true
7/6/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But the non inert thing not I guess
7/6/17, 13:23 - Bas Gieling: yea really :( and yea i think only when theyre between parentheses, again that is what they do in example 5.17
7/6/17, 13:24 - Bas Gieling: sander can you take a look at that example before continuing confusing people with mixed signals :p
7/6/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: is that example in the reader or the book?
7/6/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: im confused
7/6/17, 13:25 - Bas Gieling: is there a book?
7/6/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah it's on cs
7/6/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: but the reader then
7/6/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: thanks haha
7/6/17, 13:25 - Bas Gieling: oh ehh
7/6/17, 13:25 - Bas Gieling: its in the "automata book complete" on cs-students
7/6/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah i found it
7/6/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: thanks
7/6/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: :)
7/6/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I'll check that out
7/6/17, 13:26 - Bas Gieling: aight
7/6/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Okay I'ma check now bas
7/6/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: u guys were talking about "Intuitively, while q0 can ‘forget’
is potential of doing an action a by the silent transition to q3" in 5.17?
7/6/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ill read the chat again nvm
7/6/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Strange I see now
7/6/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Maybe they made a mistake
7/6/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Wouldn't be the first time
7/6/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: also vink didnt write that in video lectures too
7/6/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: he did 5.17
7/6/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Example 5.17?
7/6/17, 13:31 - Bas Gieling: what didnt he write?
7/6/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: the T step that goes to a different color or somthing
7/6/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: isnt it what we are talking abut
7/6/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Well that you should write
7/6/17, 13:31 - Bas Gieling: didnt he write that step?
7/6/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But the steps comming after
7/6/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: We are in doubt now
7/6/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ill check the lecture again to make sure
7/6/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Could you report back on us?
7/6/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yes :D
7/6/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thankss😬
7/6/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah
7/6/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: its in video lecture 12b
7/6/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: minute 29
7/6/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Picture?
7/6/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: but ill still say it here he says
7/6/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 13:35 - Bas Gieling: i just realised that it shouldnt matter for the resulting colouring whether or not we write these
7/6/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thats what he said
7/6/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Iknow bas
7/6/17, 13:36 - Bas Gieling: alright, then thats the answer
7/6/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But they can still deduct points
7/6/17, 13:36 - Bas Gieling: yea
7/6/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So we don't mention the steps after if the Tau is not inert?
7/6/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: What does inert mean
7/6/17, 13:37 - Bas Gieling: correct
7/6/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That it goes to a different color
7/6/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Basically
7/6/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Simply said
7/6/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oki
7/6/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah
7/6/17, 13:37 - Bas Gieling: inert means that the tau steps takes you from a state with a certain colour to another state with the same colour
7/6/17, 13:37 - Bas Gieling: same*, not different
7/6/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Oh sorry thought she meant non inert
7/6/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: here its the same thing again
7/6/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: q0 cant make b step anymore
7/6/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: also idk why there is no T/1 i think thats a mistake
7/6/17, 13:40 - Bas Gieling: yea tau/1 is the inert step, that you put between parentheses
7/6/17, 13:41 - Bas Gieling: its annoying that they dont do it all the time because im unsure whether you should always write them down or not
7/6/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah and the pdf answers are notrelated to this question so i cant make sure
7/6/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: how do you find out whether or not a tau transition is intert or not inert? do you have to do the coloring scheme for the LTS you made or is there a faster way?
7/6/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: best way is to colour imo
7/6/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: because if your tau goes to a different colour than the state you come from, its not inert
7/6/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You can look if the current state has the same options open for transitions than the state that you have after taking the Tau step
7/6/17, 13:56 - Bas Gieling: ^
7/6/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If you currently can do a, 'a' and 'b' transition
7/6/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Then take a Tau step and can only do a 'b' transition
7/6/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Than it is non inert
7/6/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys
7/6/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: some of you said you HAD to give the R = {(some,states)} after the coloring schemes
7/6/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but they dont do that in the reader
7/6/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is it even mandatoru
7/6/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If they don't ask for the relation after coloring it would be weird if it was mandatory
7/6/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: It looks like that's what they mean yeah
7/6/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Would it be enough to just have R{(q0,p0),(p0,q0)}?
7/6/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: No, because then it is not a bisimulation relation
7/6/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
7/6/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: well.. when is it then?
7/6/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: could you at least correct me when you say im wrong?
7/6/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: thanks
7/6/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You have to include all related states
7/6/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: If it meets those requirements of "if R(p, q) and there is a transition..."
7/6/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: But in the question they do state: provide a branching simulation relation of ..... relating the initial states
7/6/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: So they're asking only for initial states then right
7/6/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The relation of the initial stated is part of the entire relation
7/6/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yes, so it has to be a relation that _also_ includes (p0, q0)
7/6/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Okay
7/6/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But just that element is not enough for it to be a bisimulation relation
7/6/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: So just give R(qx,qy) for all states that are related, with the proper formulation of course
7/6/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: But shouldn't there be a third case for when vy contains some a's and some b's
7/6/17, 14:17 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Taken string incorrect
7/6/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: wasnt the proof wrong
7/6/17, 14:17 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: If you take out middle a
7/6/17, 14:17 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Language still holds
7/6/17, 14:18 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Having wRw
7/6/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Why? The empty string is not the reverse of a^m
7/6/17, 14:18 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Where u is empty
7/6/17, 14:18 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: wR - ab w-ba
7/6/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah
7/6/17, 14:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 14:18 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: u Is empty and thus uR
7/6/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: U is not empty
7/6/17, 14:19 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I don't think something that long will come on exam
7/6/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: U is a^m
7/6/17, 14:19 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Dude
7/6/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 14:20 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's just for you to ease that
7/6/17, 14:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I cant see anything in picture
7/6/17, 14:20 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Abba still belongs to vwRvRwv
7/6/17, 14:20 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Where wR - ab
7/6/17, 14:20 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: And w - ba
7/6/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Oohh I get it
7/6/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Thanks
7/6/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: But does anyone have the correct proof then for this
7/6/17, 14:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You can use ab for w and ab for v or something else
7/6/17, 14:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Then it will work
7/6/17, 14:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: But it will be shit long
7/6/17, 14:22 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: That's why I assume something like that won't come 
Although still good to practice idk
7/6/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah exactly I did it with ab for w and ac for v but it was indeed very long but it's the same idea after that right?
7/6/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: As vink did
7/6/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Only with another longwr string
7/6/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I officially give up
7/6/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I gave up assignment 1, but have some hope left for 2 and 3
7/6/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: think those are pretty doable
7/6/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: at least 3
7/6/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 3 is about parse trees and chapter 5, 2 things I havent even started on
7/6/17, 14:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I understand question 2 and question 1 partially but I;m too done
7/6/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: With 2 and 3 we can get 6.0 and with the basecase for 1 a 6.5
7/6/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: More than enough for the 5.0
7/6/17, 14:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 14:28 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: What you can do is learning finishing moves of theorems with claims
7/6/17, 14:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 14:28 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: They are not that long 
And still give you 15 points
7/6/17, 14:29 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Haha also did this
7/6/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: wait i thought 3 was about lts :/
7/6/17, 14:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah but is it th way its supposed to be
7/6/17, 14:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Because i need 2pages just for b alone
7/6/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i dont even know what you mean with finishing moves of theorems
7/6/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Explain?
7/6/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: That's actually right indeed dimitar 😂 but that's why probably the ones on the test will be smaller
7/6/17, 14:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Papa bless
7/6/17, 14:31 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Like some theorems have claims 
In that case they provide with first part of the proof 
Then the claim ( one direction or two)
Then they finish proof assuming claim holds
Proof Claim -25 
Finish proof assuming claim holds - 15
7/6/17, 14:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also by any change question 2 b is mostly applying the pumping lemma to prove its not context free right? Is there a good chance we will have to provide grammar generating L
7/6/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but finishing the proof is pretty difficult as well
7/6/17, 14:32 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: However, it's easier then memorizing two directions of claims and still give you something
7/6/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yeah fair point
7/6/17, 14:32 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: In 3.29 for example it's really tiny
7/6/17, 14:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Although the in 3.32 it has important statement which explained like "it's for reader to reason why is it so"  
That's why I guess this one least probably will come
7/6/17, 14:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I wish tho I can sneak into Vink's head and tell you what's is goin on there but no
7/6/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I appreciate you trying to help me, but even if I were lucky to actually get a question I know how to do the finishing move I'm not able to get a 5.3

7/6/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: nice
7/6/17, 14:37 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Hahahahha
7/6/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: oops

7/6/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: wrong one XD
7/6/17, 14:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ok i need some help on the long ass question after getting all the forms how do we come to the conclusion that its not context free. W needs to start with a and end in b and wr is the other way around? i am stuck now :{
7/6/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: isnt that from an exam already
7/6/17, 14:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yes its exam :D
7/6/17, 14:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i hope stupid vink doesn't give us long shit like  this
7/6/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: it was given on a past test :D
7/6/17, 14:39 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Nope
7/6/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: no?
7/6/17, 14:39 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: On past test it was WW
7/6/17, 14:39 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: This is examplary not actual one
7/6/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oh okay
7/6/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i thought its from past exam
7/6/17, 14:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ok so andrei
7/6/17, 14:40 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Which is from examples 
Full proof given
7/6/17, 14:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can you explain how do you conclude the long crap is nt context free
7/6/17, 14:40 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: As it was in intermediate test btw
7/6/17, 14:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i get that w is starting with a and ends in b and wr is the other way around but why is it not possible?
7/6/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I thought ww^R was context free
7/6/17, 14:42 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Because in all this cases changes number of a's/a's and b's/b's unbalance the string
7/6/17, 14:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: it is
7/6/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: cant we just say the strings dont have the same lenght so its not in language
7/6/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: WW^R is context free
7/6/17, 14:42 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: ww^R is context free
7/6/17, 14:42 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: WW is not
7/6/17, 14:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but is WWrWrW context free?!
7/6/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: The question is about ww then?
7/6/17, 14:42 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Nope
7/6/17, 14:43 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Because there are W on edges
7/6/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: how do i argument it
7/6/17, 14:43 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: And Double w^R in middle
7/6/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: WWrWWr would be though
7/6/17, 14:43 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Same way you reason ww
7/6/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ahhh ok i get it
7/6/17, 14:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so if its was as Daniel said it would be context free
7/6/17, 14:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: WWrWWr
7/6/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Yes
7/6/17, 14:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ok thanks
7/6/17, 14:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :}
7/6/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: 👌🏻
7/6/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: the answers for exercises about communication functions and stuff are complicating
7/6/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: got any tips on how to solve pumping lemma exercizes?
7/6/17, 14:47 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Be sure you know how to prove ones from examples and exercises
7/6/17, 14:47 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Answers are in the end
7/6/17, 14:47 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: For exercises
7/6/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I would learn which w they pick for every excersise in the reader
7/6/17, 14:48 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yeap
7/6/17, 14:48 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: And more precisely the one with having a^n where n is prime
7/6/17, 14:48 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: As long as this one is a bit different from others
7/6/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: sorry?
7/6/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: n is prime?
7/6/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: which exercise is that
7/6/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I one with a^n^2 is easy but I find the proof logic slightly different
7/6/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: So I would also focus on that one
7/6/17, 14:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Example 3.56
7/6/17, 14:50 - Bas Gieling: this isnt context free either
7/6/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Why?
7/6/17, 14:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i think it shold be
7/6/17, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Isn't the concatenation of two context free languages context free?
7/6/17, 14:51 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: WWr is context free
7/6/17, 14:52 - Bas Gieling: oh
7/6/17, 14:52 - Bas Gieling: right
7/6/17, 14:52 - Bas Gieling: mb
7/6/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Can someone confirm this
7/6/17, 14:52 - Bas Gieling: oh wait
7/6/17, 14:52 - Bas Gieling: yea no
7/6/17, 14:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well W is context free
WW is not
7/6/17, 14:52 - Bas Gieling: this isnt the concatenation of 2 context free languages
7/6/17, 14:52 - Bas Gieling: if you have WWrVVr with W and V different words
7/6/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Daniel its not context free
7/6/17, 14:53 - Bas Gieling: then it would be context free
7/6/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Try w=ab^ma
7/6/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Then you can use pumping lemma to proof its not context free
7/6/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: W=a(b^m)a
7/6/17, 14:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Remember that a^m has length m
And vxy is Lower or equal to m
7/6/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I'll try out in a bit Thorn thanks
7/6/17, 14:54 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: But string used for this proof is incorrect as well as solution
7/6/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: But now I'm a bit confused haha
7/6/17, 14:55 - Bas Gieling: daniel the concatenation of two context-free languages is indeed context free
7/6/17, 14:56 - Bas Gieling: but w wr w wr is not the full concatenation of two context free languages
7/6/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Okok
7/6/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I got your example with the different variables
7/6/17, 14:56 - Bas Gieling: w wr v vr is, where w and v are free to be any two words
7/6/17, 14:56 - Bas Gieling: yea, alright
7/6/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Thanks dude
7/6/17, 14:56 - Bas Gieling: np :p
7/6/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: then where can I find the proper solution/

7/6/17, 15:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: might aswell call it a bit excessive
7/6/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but that is how you should word it right?
7/6/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: it's the proper way to do it
7/6/17, 15:02 - Bas Gieling: i agree :p its a bit unclear like this though
7/6/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: any tips on how to draw the LTSs with communication functions and stuff
7/6/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: What are communication functions
7/6/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ohh wait that's the a?,a! Stuff

7/6/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah with a!?_!!?!?! stuf
7/6/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: idk how to approach them and connect states
7/6/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Just see which transitions are taken when you take d? And d! At the same time and write those transitions as a d
7/6/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: but they are not taken at the same time
7/6/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: foe example
7/6/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: So in this case from the states with B0 and C1 to the states with B1 and C0 where A stays the same

7/6/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: They have to be taken at the same time
7/6/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: That's what the communication function states
7/6/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: (c?,c!) = c

7/6/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I mean c*

7/6/17, 15:14 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: guys, where do we have the automata exam tomorrow ? can't recall receiving any emails about it !
7/6/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Read this one again that was pretty clear I think
7/6/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: This was for d
7/6/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oh instead of taking c! And then c? To go to a1b0c1 we take one c

7/6/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I get it

7/6/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That's how we did it and it works just fine
7/6/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's not even that much work too
7/6/17, 15:17 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: +1
Have we already received info about where the exam is going to be held?

7/6/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
7/6/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: can we change the title of this group chat to it for just a day? I'm not in the spam caht
7/6/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: chat*
7/6/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: You know you can also just write it down 🤷‍♂
7/6/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: shit youre right
7/6/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Or make it your lock screen background

7/6/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Words written on your hand during a test might not be a good idea...
7/6/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: InB4 you get removed from the exam room because they think you wrote a cheat sheet on your hand
7/6/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: dumbass
7/6/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I don't think they're going to think you're cheating just because you have some room numbers on your hand, right?
7/6/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: they're all 50+ they got no clue what the subject is about and whether it is related to the subject
7/6/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and in "their time" this was the go-to method for cheating
7/6/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But, there is always an expert on the matter present at the exam, who in turn can say "This isn't cheating"
7/6/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Not having to deal with the bullshit that ensues is still the better option though
7/6/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That would make sense but often enough there are only fossils present
7/6/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (Sometimes the expert is a fossil as well)
7/6/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But yeah, I'm with Storm :P
7/6/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: jan friso
7/6/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
7/6/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: in this case it is gerard zwaan: also a fossil
7/6/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He isn't present in all rooms at once

7/6/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: as in can you just treat them as also being in a communication function together?
7/6/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope, they don't have the !  and ?
7/6/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, there isn't a communication function defined for them
7/6/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: so you just treat them as if they were two different variables but name them the same?
7/6/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You underestimate the power of the Gerard
7/6/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, say p is in p1 and q in q0, then p will transfer to p2 and q to q2
7/6/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: so then they do move at the same time?
7/6/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: oh but they can move both at the same time and seperate or?
7/6/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, if p is in p0 and q in q2, then only p will move
7/6/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (And vice versa ofc\
7/6/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: )

7/6/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The 10-12 transition is incorrect iirc
7/6/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, wait
7/6/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nvm
7/6/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is correct
7/6/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: You scared me for a second there haha
7/6/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Thanks man :)
7/6/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But the 10-20 transition is incorrect
7/6/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Oh yeah I see
7/6/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: No wait
7/6/17, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: If p is in 1 and q in 0 then b moves both of them right?
7/6/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, so it moves to 22
7/6/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And not to 20]
7/6/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i dont think its correct
7/6/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Oh wait I read it wrong, right
7/6/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Thanks
7/6/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Oh damn, more confusion let's go
7/6/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay, the 10-12 transition is incorrect
7/6/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because the only transition possible from 10 is 22
7/6/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Yeah you right
7/6/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: are you sure the lts's can both change when they do a b? Cause there  is no communication function defined
7/6/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: My heads done for today
7/6/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: That was  stupid mistake
7/6/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, but both HAVE to take the transition
7/6/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Well if they're both in a state with a outgoing transition b and b comes up it seems logical
7/6/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬ joined using this group's invite link
7/6/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, this
7/6/17, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: ok, if youre certain about that, then youre right :P

7/6/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: Dont you guys mean 3a? And 3b?
7/6/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Lol oops
7/6/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i guess
7/6/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: lol yeah...
7/6/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: use answers are on canvas
7/6/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: not grades, just answers
7/6/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then the grades will land soon, I guess?
7/6/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: 6 questions taken out
7/6/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: Nice
7/6/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: Yeah lol
7/6/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: depends on how long it takes those incapable cucks to push a piece of paper through a marking machine
7/6/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They should
7/6/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Let's hope so, I can't be bothered to check the answers against what I think I selected for every question
7/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So guys, lets realize
7/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 10% of the exam was too bad to grade...
7/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Well those fuckers
7/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: haha, everyone got question 24 correct
7/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Lol serious?
7/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Releasing the answers without the questions
7/6/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: At least 1 correct 💪🏼
7/6/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: So you think those 6 questions will be good if u had it right and nothing if u had then wrong? That would be awesome
7/6/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: http://www.man-man-man.nl/
7/6/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It were 60 questions, and iirc 6/60 = 10%
7/6/17, 16:24 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Is there anyone who's paper with questions was not taken away?
7/6/17, 16:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok thats fine that they fucked up 6 questions  but yeah does someone actualy have the questions
7/6/17, 16:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Otherwise there is no point in this really
7/6/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Nope had to hand it in
7/6/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: No idea why
7/6/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope, they are kept pretty secure because they are re-used
7/6/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: .
7/6/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Well thats a bugger... defeats 50% of the usefulness of this answer sheet
7/6/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: They'll probably release the grades very soon since the only work for them is determining which questions are bad (which is done) and submitting the results
7/6/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, you can still complain about question 60, since that one was unanswerable as well
7/6/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or, you can argue at least
7/6/17, 16:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What was 60?
7/6/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The one with the non-matching last names
7/6/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If i have a 5 then im sattisfied
7/6/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: Uhhm how from 02 to 00?
7/6/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Same, but it is a tip for if you just miss one point
7/6/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: it misses one from 21 to 00, a c transition
7/6/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 60 was Value Sensitive Design apparently, about the method described in the article
7/6/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: and this one because if p is in 0 and q in 2 and there is a c step p can't move, but q can to 0
7/6/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: @31641585979
7/6/17, 16:28 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: This actually reaaaally retarded just taking away the questions without giving free points for them 
BECAUSE we spent time doing this questions, and since they were wrong probably too much time
7/6/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: They lowered the norm tho, now a 5 is only 31 points vs 39 before
7/6/17, 16:29 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: That's fucking dumb
7/6/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: however 3 hours for 60 multiple choice questions is a shitload of time, so they already let us make a test without time pressure
7/6/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Can we move Use discussion to spamchat, Such that people here can focus on automaton
7/6/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: Yeah but c! And c? Have to be syncded so 02 to niet 00 is not possible right?
7/6/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: so that time factor hasn't too much of an impact
7/6/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: c! and c?  have to be linked, c doesnt
7/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: this is what vink did
7/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can someone tell me why we need 2 cases for the proof of 3.44? I was looking through it, but couldn't see why we need 2 cases to show it
7/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: But c means the link between c! And c? According to the exercise?
7/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: I have this for 2a
7/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: it is the link but it's also on its own
7/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: Rlly? Im confused then lol
7/6/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah this shit confuses the shit out of me too, but my way leads you to Vink's answer so i guess i'm going with that
7/6/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: Hmm
7/6/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: just fuck automata in general haha
7/6/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: Maas I didnt know you were robosexual
7/6/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I already like both guys and girls I might as well add robots to that list
7/6/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Can someone repost the examplary exam as worked out by Vink?
7/6/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I thought someone posted them but I can't seem to find them anymore
7/6/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: like all the pictures
7/6/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: ↑
7/6/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Tyty 😄
7/6/17, 16:44 - Kevin Jilissen: In this picture, state '10' has 2 outgoing 'b' transitions (to '20' and '12'). Is that allowed or should they be merged into one transition to '22'
7/6/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys
7/6/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Hakan

7/6/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Can we also find the exam ?
7/6/17, 16:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Nope
7/6/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: No that's what we're all mad about

7/6/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: We can switch to automata
7/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Does anyone have a good explanation and example of using the pumping lemma for CFL ?
7/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: What do you mean
7/6/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: you can use example 3.56 from the reader
7/6/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: More explaination than the theorem itself?

7/6/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 350+ messages
7/6/17, 17:08 - Kevin Jilissen: anyone knows what this should be?
7/6/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It has to be 22, since the transition to 20 and 12 happens simultaneously
7/6/17, 17:10 - Kevin Jilissen: okay, thanks
7/6/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: You have to attend an exam in order to be allowed to go to the resit right?
7/6/17, 17:14 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I wouldn't advice doing resit
7/6/17, 17:14 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's way harder
7/6/17, 17:14 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: He makes it so on purpose
7/6/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Andrei I don't think you can really choose to do it
7/6/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Its more 'I managed to do it first time or not'
7/6/17, 17:15 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Like if you still can do something go and do and don't give up
7/6/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: Well it's a bit to late to start studying now
7/6/17, 17:15 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's possible to learn third exercise and memorize examples and exercises answers for pumping lemma
7/6/17, 17:15 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: There are 6 of them
7/6/17, 17:16 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: But anyway yea you need to attend it in order to go for resit
7/6/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: Ah oke thank you

7/6/17, 17:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yep
7/6/17, 17:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Correct
7/6/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ah, thanks :D that's at least 10 points
7/6/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Why the x'es
7/6/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Did anyone do exemplary exam 2016 assignment 3?
7/6/17, 17:36 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Show how it looks
7/6/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Which one is that again?

7/6/17, 17:38 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Second one has one deadlock state right?
7/6/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hmm i can take a look at it after dinner if you like
7/6/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i need this one solution becuz i cant do it
7/6/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: would be nice if someone does
7/6/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Havent made that one yet

7/6/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah
7/6/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Oh wait i did i think
7/6/17, 17:39 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: In last coloring scheme
7/6/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Bit that was on a blackboard lel
7/6/17, 17:40 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: In the bottom reverse c/4 with -
7/6/17, 17:40 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Missed X with W for this one
7/6/17, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Technically can also do tau to u, a to v then tau to u again
7/6/17, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: wouldn't that be a move too much? I thought you could only do a/b/c/etc step, or a tau+a/b/c/etc step
7/6/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: arent d's and b's taus
7/6/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Oh, that might be Joost, I haven't heard that
7/6/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: In that case, you're right
7/6/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: there are still taus in the end tho on the drawing
7/6/17, 17:47 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Check next page
7/6/17, 17:47 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: First one is still first task
7/6/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oh oka
7/6/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: y sorry
7/6/17, 17:48 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: No problemo
7/6/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Has anyone seen any exam questions about chomsky normal form?
7/6/17, 17:48 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Nope
7/6/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: do we abstract taus
7/6/17, 17:48 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Last year they gave one of the books example
7/6/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: do you have to go to a specific room tomorrow for the exam? or is any of the ones mentioned on the mytue calendar fine?
7/6/17, 17:48 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Abstract?
7/6/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: like just dont write the states with taus
7/6/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: nvm i guess thats not possible
7/6/17, 17:49 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You have to
7/6/17, 17:49 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You only replace transitions which are stated in I like I (b,d) by taus
7/6/17, 17:49 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Because taus are important
7/6/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: but i dont get
7/6/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: how we go from top drawing to bottom one
7/6/17, 17:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: There are states which are not reachable
7/6/17, 17:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You just go from initial state
7/6/17, 17:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: And find to which states you can actually arrive
7/6/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 17:50 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: For this example you can't arrive to all of them
7/6/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Like eliminating 10 and 20?
7/6/17, 17:51 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yea
7/6/17, 17:51 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: But, it's better to show both versions
7/6/17, 17:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: On paper
7/6/17, 17:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: With all states
7/6/17, 17:52 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: And non reachable states eliminated
7/6/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Why didnt you write the tau from 11
7/6/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: In the second drawing
7/6/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: To 01 and 21
7/6/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: @79853412264 can you show me your coloring of the states for assignment 3b of exam-july? I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly
7/6/17, 17:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Which one?
7/6/17, 17:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: 2016?
7/6/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I think so
7/6/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 17:57 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: <Media omitted>

7/6/17, 17:58 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's a lot of bad handwriting and crosses but I hope you will be able to read it
7/6/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, I can read it
7/6/17, 17:59 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yay
7/6/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but I was wondering why you only use 1 tau step every time, because some of the states have multiple tau transitions that lead to different states
7/6/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: like state 11
7/6/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: also, I see you also did some double tau steps into an a step, which I didn't think you were allowed to do
7/6/17, 18:04 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: If you have two taus going to one color there is no reason to indicate it twice
7/6/17, 18:04 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's the same thing
7/6/17, 18:05 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You can use follow as many taus as possible until you reach a letter
7/6/17, 18:05 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: After it you can't go any step further following this route
7/6/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but what if the tau going to the same color at first, goes to a different color later?
7/6/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: you'd have to write that down right?
7/6/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and wasn't there something about having a tau transition to a color that is not the color of the state it is leaving from?
7/6/17, 18:11 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: If it is going to the same color it is leaving from you use brackets
7/6/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: FYI  if you signed up to be a next year mentor I just got a mail that I was selected. And 35 other people as well
7/6/17, 18:11 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: If not it's a part then without and it counts for creating choosing color
7/6/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ah, so that's how it works
7/6/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thanks!
7/6/17, 18:11 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: If it's in brackets it doesn't matter but you better indicate it's existence
7/6/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: @31624553225
7/6/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: For assignment 3b, how do you finish proving that the LTS's are branching bisimilar after you make the colour code table?
7/6/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Do you just say 'the colours are the same so they are branching bisimilar' or something?
7/6/17, 19:10 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Say why it terminated
Say it bisimillar because of initial states
Then indicate the relation (just to be safe)
7/6/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: What do you mean by terminated? The others I understand
7/6/17, 19:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Like why you stopped doing more colors
7/6/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ohhhh
7/6/17, 19:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Like c2 and c3 have the same colors, thus procedure has finished or so
7/6/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: So just explain that you had the same amount of colours twice in a row so its k
7/6/17, 19:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I am not sure that it's a requirement tho
7/6/17, 19:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Just makes sense to me
7/6/17, 19:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yep
7/6/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Better safe than sorry when you will need all points
7/6/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Thanks man
7/6/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Write: the coloring has stabelized and the intial states have the same color bla bla bla
7/6/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Aight
7/6/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: it's just that it stops when the initial states have the same color, and the amount of colors doesn't change anymore. What I usually write down is why it stops(the amount of colors in the last 2 columns are the same, hence it terminates), and follow it up by saying that the initial states have the same color, so they are branching bisimilar
7/6/17, 19:15 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's not so
7/6/17, 19:16 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It stops if the amount of colors is the same twice in a row
7/6/17, 19:16 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Initial states have same color of its branching bisimillar
7/6/17, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: when doing CFG proofs with the pumping lemma, is it sufficient to only have 2 cases (for the strings containing (a, b)*) :
-vy contains only a's
_vy contains both a's and b's
or am i missing a side case now (only b's)?
7/6/17, 19:16 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: If it's not then they have different colors
7/6/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: make it 1)only a's 2)at least one b
7/6/17, 19:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: since it can be that there are only b's in the last case
7/6/17, 19:20 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i agree, its just that in the answers of the excercises they do it like i wrote it down which is causing my confusion
7/6/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Told ya😜
7/6/17, 19:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Just do at least one b to be safe
7/6/17, 19:37 - Bas Gieling: they do it like this in the exercises too right?
7/6/17, 19:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Idk Florian says not
7/6/17, 19:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But vink did
7/6/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 19:46 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: It's explained better in the reader
7/6/17, 19:46 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I would say
7/6/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: i understand why the cases are: contains only a's and the other contains at least one b
7/6/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: but why in this answer they just dont do that
7/6/17, 19:47 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: :S
7/6/17, 19:47 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: This one was made by students right?
7/6/17, 19:51 - Bas Gieling: yea this is incorrect
7/6/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: is only the case distinction wrong? or is the whole proof wrong?
7/6/17, 19:52 - Bas Gieling: the case distinction
7/6/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: The case distinction is not complete
7/6/17, 19:52 - Bas Gieling: but if you say #a(vy) >= 0 then i think its correct
7/6/17, 19:52 - Bas Gieling: in the second case
7/6/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: yeah, i thought the same
7/6/17, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah. You could also add a third case for 'only b's', but that's more work
7/6/17, 19:53 - Bas Gieling: yea

7/6/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: they shouldnt be there, but technically theyre bisimilar
7/6/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: But they shouldnt be there?
7/6/17, 20:23 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: so i can just remove them from this R and its fine?
7/6/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: When you remove the actions from the set H some states might become unreachable, I would personally remove them if thats the case
7/6/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: to simplify the LTS
7/6/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: n'ice
7/6/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: but this bisimulation relation is technically correct
7/6/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: but its also correct if you remove them
7/6/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: thank you daddy
7/6/17, 20:25 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: good

7/6/17, 20:26 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: He added them

7/6/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: so i would include them

7/6/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: from 03 to 00
7/6/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: gast wat denkt vink wel niet
7/6/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hij kan de vinketering krijgen
7/6/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: hoe wil je dat weten tbh
7/6/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: omdat die ook nergens naartoe leiden net als W?
7/6/17, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Okay thank you @31640634783
7/6/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: ey rubain niet je commanding officer beledigen he
7/6/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ohja sorry
7/6/17, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: @31640634783
7/6/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: nou 20 en 10 hebben allebei geen outgoing transitions
7/6/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: als je de tau van 10 niet meetelt want die gaat naar zelfde kleur
7/6/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: en w ook niet
7/6/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: dus als je colouring tegelijk doet op allebei de LTSs
7/6/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: dan krijgen die dezelfde kleur
7/6/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: en kan je ze dus bisimilar noemen
7/6/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: maar zelf had ik ze weggehaald

7/6/17, 20:32 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: It's the language that the epda accepts
7/6/17, 20:32 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: N(P) is the set of strings accepted by the push down automaton

7/6/17, 20:33 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: They just use a different symbol because they PDAs and ePDAs are so similar
7/6/17, 20:33 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: so it just means the language accepted by P'?
7/6/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: yes

7/6/17, 21:29 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I guess it either won't come on the exam or they'll tell to assume that this is common truth
7/6/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Isn't that just by definition of Reach?
7/6/17, 21:30 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: S can produce a string that contains A, therefore A is reachable
7/6/17, 21:32 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I think so
7/6/17, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: But how can you just assume that S =>* alpha A beta for all A element of V''
7/6/17, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah, I was thinking that maybe that's what you're actually supposed to verify
7/6/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i didnt get how you wrote the R, 00 and X dont have the same color

7/6/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: did you pick v and w yet?
7/6/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: set w = bmambmambm
7/6/17, 22:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: with the m's being ^m
7/6/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and do the usual
7/6/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: as seen in example 3.56
7/6/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if you have a moment I'll send you pictures

7/6/17, 22:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31621372984 what do you mean by putting w to be b^m  a^m  b^m  a^m  b^m
7/6/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: You always have to pick a w in L
7/6/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: just use the pumping lemma
7/6/17, 22:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Teah but dont we pick a v too?
7/6/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Shouldnt you make v and w something like:
v = a^m b^m
w = a^m c^m
7/6/17, 22:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes
7/6/17, 22:31 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Your solution doesn't work

7/6/17, 22:31 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: If l = 0
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Baab
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah w as in the entire string
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Still in language
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You can pump it, then it will work
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so v = b^m and w = a^m
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: well i mean, this is literally the proof erik vink gave
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so yeah
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: suck a huge one
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: But there is one in wich l isnt 0
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yeah? He said its wrong
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I still think that does not work Max, as the reverse of a^m is still a^m
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Only 1 is enough to show that it doesnt hold
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 22:32 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Eric said his solution is wrong so lol
7/6/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yeah dimitar I had the same string
7/6/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: whats wrong with mine
7/6/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: 10 symbols with ^m
7/6/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: please tell me
7/6/17, 22:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Okey see
7/6/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because I do not see how my one is wrong
7/6/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Reversing a^m gives a^m
7/6/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Max look back even Andrei explained to me
7/6/17, 22:33 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: if you delete a's in the middle
7/6/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: To*
7/6/17, 22:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Fuck I mean b's
7/6/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: While reversing a^mb^m gives b^ma^m
7/6/17, 22:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Then you have ban
7/6/17, 22:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Baab*
7/6/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: PLEASE ONE AT A TIME
7/6/17, 22:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Which still in language
7/6/17, 22:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🙏🏿🦑
7/6/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: all messaging at the same time doesnt help
7/6/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31621606619 could you reply to the messages in which he explained
7/6/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because i dont get it
7/6/17, 22:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31631177227 what did you do after that ? Can i see your solution ?
7/6/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I didn't finish it on paper lol, sorry
7/6/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I can explain it though
7/6/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: There will be 6 cases:
7/6/17, 22:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok so what are my forms ? The usual first with l then eith k and l ?
7/6/17, 22:36 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Okey see 
You have string babab
If you delete b in the middle and result in baab, which you state is not ok, actually is in the language 
If w=ab and u=empty string
7/6/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Somewhere around here max a little bit higher
7/6/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: As vxy will be of length m or smaller, vxy can cover at most 2 symbols.
1. Only a
2. Only b
3. Only c
4. A and B
5. A and C
6. B and C
7/6/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: imma read the explanation you sent niels
7/6/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks anyway though
7/6/17, 22:37 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: As I said you can do this using this string, but instead of deleting strings you have to pump it
7/6/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: It's literally this explanation also from andrei tho
7/6/17, 22:38 - Bas Gieling: it would still not work
7/6/17, 22:38 - Bas Gieling: you can pump up the left and right ends of the v^R in the middle
7/6/17, 22:38 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: And?
7/6/17, 22:38 - Bas Gieling: and then those pumped up parts belong to w and w^R on the left and right of that middle v^R
7/6/17, 22:38 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Then it would be unbalanced
7/6/17, 22:38 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Oh okey
7/6/17, 22:38 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Now I see
7/6/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeh
7/6/17, 22:39 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: True, you're right
7/6/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so
7/6/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Because of this, if you have i=2, so you get uv^2xy^2z, you will have too much characters of one or two sorts, making it unbalanced
7/6/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the correct string
7/6/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is v = ambm and w=amcm?
7/6/17, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Ya
7/6/17, 22:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Tes
7/6/17, 22:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes
7/6/17, 22:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thanks so much
7/6/17, 22:39 - Bas Gieling: thatll work yeah
7/6/17, 22:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: By the way @31631177227 is listing the cases enough ?do i have to write doin each form ?
7/6/17, 22:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I mean to formulate my argument
7/6/17, 22:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Do i have to do this shit again like before
7/6/17, 22:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: imma go to bed, well see tomorrow. good night guys 😀🔫

7/6/17, 22:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🙏🏿
7/6/17, 22:40 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Loooool dimitar
7/6/17, 22:40 - Bas Gieling: sweet dreams
7/6/17, 22:41 - Bas Gieling: about beautiful automata
7/6/17, 22:41 - Bas Gieling: or useful use
7/6/17, 22:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I guess i dont 😬
7/6/17, 22:41 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: <Media omitted>
7/6/17, 22:41 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Do explain it shortly that each case makes it unbalanced
7/6/17, 22:41 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: But don't work them all out
7/6/17, 22:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Are we sure about this ? That its not nessesary?
7/6/17, 22:43 - Bas Gieling: my answer would be "explain enough for it to be proven"
7/6/17, 22:43 - Bas Gieling: but thats a useless answer
7/6/17, 22:43 - Bas Gieling: i dont really have a concrete amount explanation i always give
7/6/17, 22:43 - Bas Gieling: i sometimes work them out if i feel like its needed
7/6/17, 22:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also is it just me or are 99% of questions not context free and the reason is because of the same reason with unbalance
7/6/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: If you have the time on your test to work it out because you skip question 1, then maybe use that time to write it all out
7/6/17, 22:43 - Bas Gieling: sometimes i dont when i think explanation suffices
7/6/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: But it feels like a waste
7/6/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: They will almost definitely ask for a language that is not context free indeed
7/6/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I'm skipping 1 so using all the time on 2&3 haha
7/6/17, 22:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And like all of them prove with unbalance or the prime number
7/6/17, 22:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I didnt see any other options for being not context free
7/6/17, 22:45 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Unbalance is not always true, with a^n^2 for example you have to prove that you end up with something that is not a square
7/6/17, 22:45 - Bas Gieling: yea, in that case you do need to work the entire thing out
7/6/17, 22:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😢
7/6/17, 22:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Fuckherrightinthepussy
7/6/17, 22:46 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And there was another one regarding primes where it was also different
7/6/17, 22:46 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Most are unbalance though yeah
7/6/17, 22:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Are those exceptions in pdf or what ?
7/6/17, 22:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I only remeber the prime being different because its no longer prime after that
7/6/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yeah that is the one
7/6/17, 22:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Well where is a^n^2
7/6/17, 22:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Is it in pdf
7/6/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 3.6.3
7/6/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 125

7/6/17, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Its like this;
7/6/17, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You can have that vy is a substring of a 0^(m/2m/3m) doesnt matter which one
7/6/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Pumping that would mean that its no longer in the form of m, 2m, 3m
7/6/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Cuz one of the m's is different now
7/6/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Should that really matter Stef
7/6/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ths other case is that a 1 is included and then it still doesnt work
7/6/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: We should treat everyone equallt
7/6/17, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: LOL
7/6/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Because it is different we gonna reject

7/6/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i got it tho thanks

7/6/17, 23:47 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: cool
7/7/17, 01:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Guys if we pump
7/7/17, 01:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: And we get a^m+l
7/7/17, 01:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Is that l<m?
7/7/17, 01:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: And if we have due to pumping a^m+l and b^m+k is it 0<k+l<m??
7/7/17, 01:32 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: yes, you will have that since |vxy| <= m
7/7/17, 01:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But you can pump vy multiple times right?
7/7/17, 01:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So if you have multiples of vy
7/7/17, 01:32 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: yes
7/7/17, 01:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: They can be bigger than m?
7/7/17, 01:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Or is that wrong thinking?
7/7/17, 01:33 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: no, you can have that ^. I think you are refering to the exercise with a^(m^2) right ?
7/7/17, 01:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Not exactly
7/7/17, 01:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But is it enough to mention that 0<l
7/7/17, 01:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Or should you also say that it's smaller than m?
7/7/17, 01:34 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: you also need to say it's less than m
7/7/17, 01:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But if you pump vy 4 times
7/7/17, 01:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It will def not be
7/7/17, 01:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If vy would be a^l
7/7/17, 01:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Oh wait
7/7/17, 01:35 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: yes, it depends on the exercise
7/7/17, 01:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Then it would also be a^4l?
7/7/17, 01:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: In the string
7/7/17, 01:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Or a^3/
7/7/17, 01:37 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: if you have that |vy| = l and you pump it 4 times, your string will have 4 × l + |uxz|
7/7/17, 01:38 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: hope it helps
7/7/17, 01:40 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Lol yeh should be fine
7/7/17, 01:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: One of those last moment stress things

7/7/17, 08:07 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Also the needs to be space between students

7/7/17, 08:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yes you are
7/7/17, 08:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright thanks max
7/7/17, 08:44 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: No youre not
7/7/17, 08:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 😢
7/7/17, 08:44 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Imma see you at the resit
7/7/17, 08:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i cri
7/7/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Question 3 was exactly the same as on one of the practice exams
7/7/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: 🎉
7/7/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Question 1 as well
7/7/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: The implication was the other way this time right?
7/7/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: They asked left to right this time instead right to left
7/7/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Not that I actually did 1 except for the base case haha
7/7/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Oh fuck yeah then i got it right
7/7/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: What was the proof of 2b
7/7/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: The same as always right?
7/7/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: You always disturbed one of the v1 or v2 and not the other so they would become imbalanced
7/7/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: And would fall out of L
7/7/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: So yeah, same as always
7/7/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I did something random
7/7/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Might be correct
7/7/17, 10:09 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Have a nice summer break boys
7/7/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Gl boys
7/7/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I mean
7/7/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Have fun
7/7/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Yess enjoy yourselves and forget about this abomination called automata
7/7/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: b^m a^m b^m a^m was fine for 2b right?
7/7/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: That might work
7/7/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Yup
7/7/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Atleast i made it work
7/7/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I had b^m a^2m c^m b^m a^2m c^m , dunno why but would it work?
7/7/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: worked fine for me at least
7/7/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Worked for me too, i had 4 cases in which they would all encounter unbalancing of b's and a's
7/7/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 4 cases?
7/7/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i had 7
7/7/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 7?
7/7/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yah
7/7/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I had two
7/7/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: This is strange
7/7/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Rip
7/7/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You had, only contains b's or contains at least one a?
7/7/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I was just improvising
7/7/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i had vxy is all in the first bm, in the second bm, in the first am or in the second am, or alternatively in the first bmam, in the first ambm or in the second bmam
7/7/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that makes 7
7/7/17, 11:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 7 cases on 3
7/7/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what?
7/7/17, 11:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Nevermind
7/7/17, 11:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😄
7/7/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: yeah ok i had similar then, i described it as only b's, only a's, BmAm or AmBm. Which there would be multiple versions of
7/7/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I had 8 letters with exponent m (made both v1 and v2 combination of their two letters) and just explained the cases as being either in one single letter or spanning between two letters, which would always imbalance v1 or v2 and thus not meet the requirements of L
7/7/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: seems fair too
7/7/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Think it should be fine when explained, don't need to say the same about every single letter option
7/7/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: How could you prove the inductive step of 1a btw?
7/7/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: i dont think i did it right
7/7/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
7/7/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Should be something like this
7/7/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: hm mine isnt like this but i might get some points for the base case and the other random shit i wrote down
7/7/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
7/7/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: You could also just do b^m c^m b^m c^m right?
7/7/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Yes
7/7/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Its for the proof the same yes
7/7/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Pumping Lemma says for ALL w in L, so yes
7/7/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: (where |w| ≥ m)
7/7/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: 1 case is enough
7/7/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Right ?
7/7/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: To prove its NOT context free
7/7/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Depends on what you mean by that case
7/7/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 38558225‬: You can also do ab^mac^mab^mac^m right
7/7/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 38558225‬: With 2 cases. With a or without a in vy
7/7/17, 12:17 - Luke Houben: If you mean with one case one string w, yeah. But a string needs multiple cases that shiw that you can't pump in any way possible
7/7/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Alright
7/7/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Then mine might be good

7/7/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: We actually got the answer key
7/7/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Fuckers
7/7/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: How hard is it
7/7/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: To check a multiple choice test
7/7/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but Hakan we cannot do anything with the answer key at all
7/7/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not allowed to take the questions home and not given the answers per student
7/7/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But they can
7/7/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: They can do something with it
7/7/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yep
7/7/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They can
7/7/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: But they don't
7/7/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But they can and they will are different things sadly
7/7/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: :(

7/8/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: Oh nvm i got it :D thanks anyways
7/8/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nailed it
7/9/17, 01:46 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
7/9/17, 01:52 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: I think it was August (it was mentioned in the last kick-off meeting i think)
7/9/17, 01:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah but there are no options as far as I can see
7/9/17, 01:54 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: I just did it in toelichting, idk what they wanted
7/9/17, 01:55 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: and my request has been pending for 1 month now
7/9/17, 01:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Uhh
7/9/17, 10:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: When I filled that in the bold piece of text for the date wasn't there..?
7/9/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Same
7/9/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The English and Dutch version of that page have different texts at the bottom of the page
7/9/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Sooo
7/9/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What to do?
7/9/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Have you already submitted?
7/9/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Noo
7/9/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Idk what to fill in in that box
7/9/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If not, look in the examenzittingen list for a date, the one in August or September could do probably. In the kick off slides you can find the date for the diploma presentation. (October 9th probably). Write these dates in the box in such a way it is clear what date is for what event. That should be enough
7/9/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Wait there are 2 dates and 2 events?
7/9/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They could really have made this more clear
7/9/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This
7/9/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: One date for the examenzitting, one for the diploma presentation
7/9/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Like in the bold text here
7/9/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: What is the p-exam even about?
7/9/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Finishing propaedeutics in one year
7/9/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: But its not actually an exam right?
7/9/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nope
7/9/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Then why is there an examenzitting
7/9/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I don't know, probably because they have to check whether you got all your ECTS and maybe sign some papers.
7/9/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Uni pls y u so retarded
7/9/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: so what do you have to fill in the box now? September for the P-exam and October for the diplomauitreiking?
7/9/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: is it worth to go to a diplomauitreiking btw? or is it some dude patting you on the back with some border public?
7/9/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: August for P-exam is also possible
7/9/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: My student mentor said it was worth it, and that it is a unique opportunity. You have to decide for yourself whether you want to participate or not
7/9/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: and an examenzitting is both for the exam and the uitreiking
7/9/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: ?
7/9/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: or are there different dates for the uitreikingen
7/9/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: This
7/9/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: where can i find those? 😅
7/9/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Examenzitting is one of the dates in the list that is linked on osiris, uitreiking is in October

7/10/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I'm pretty sure it's the latter
7/10/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: alright and when are you applicable for merit or distinction on your diploma?
7/10/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys what was the maximum

7/11/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: We don't know the calculation right
7/11/17, 10:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Well we do
7/11/17, 10:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 54 qyestiobs are left
7/11/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah
7/11/17, 10:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: You need 31 for 5
7/11/17, 10:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And the first few correct dot count
7/11/17, 10:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So you can find the exact amount
7/11/17, 10:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: From the info in study guide
7/11/17, 10:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Then substract that amount of questions from 54
7/11/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ohh okay nice because I have 4.8 as well
7/11/17, 10:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: You get the amount of questions that do give you actual points for the grade
7/11/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: WE HAVE TO FIGHT NIELS
7/11/17, 10:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Then its easy to find how much 1 question gives
7/11/17, 10:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes
7/11/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: also guys do u know why they cancelled those questions? Was it because many ppl did it wrong?
7/11/17, 10:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I belive there is a good chance you can get 1 point
7/11/17, 10:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: No
7/11/17, 10:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its because they were controversial or incorrectly asked
7/11/17, 10:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Left too much room for interpretation and stuff like that
7/11/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Okay
7/11/17, 10:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: There is a good chance if you guys have 4.8 ( i belive you need 1 point but someone should calculate it just to be sure) that you can get it. And idk but i find it very kind and uplifting if they are just good people and maybe give it to you for free. I mean come one how much is 1 question its not like oh i am sorry you are dumb. Have hope guys
7/11/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: How do you want to do that?
7/11/17, 10:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Checking questions trying to sliver 1 point from somewhere.... being cute kawai handsome persuasive
7/11/17, 10:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Idk
7/11/17, 10:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: For 1 point i would buy roel some fine laminated fontys fkiers
7/11/17, 10:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Fliers
7/11/17, 11:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: No but in a serious note
7/11/17, 11:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Getting 1 question to be give should be possible
7/11/17, 11:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: While it is true that the machine probably didny grade you incorrect it is possible that they didnt remove a controversial question or something like that
7/11/17, 11:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Last year 10 questions were removed
7/11/17, 11:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: This year 6
7/11/17, 11:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So maybe they missed one and if enough people complain
7/11/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: We need a group chat for people with a 4.8 💪🏻
7/11/17, 11:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: There is atleast 3 people
7/11/17, 11:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31644497802 @31614549685  @31643411381  and maybe if ir remeber @31621606619
7/11/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yes me too
7/11/17, 11:07 - Renate Lemmens: Same here
7/11/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Question 60, guyys
7/11/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That one contained a mistake, but wasn't removed
7/11/17, 11:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes but most people got it right i think
7/11/17, 11:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Val sensitive
7/11/17, 11:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also what was the mistake in it ?
7/11/17, 11:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31642623926
7/11/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The last name didn't match the last name in the text
7/11/17, 11:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh
7/11/17, 11:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah but taking that one out probably wont help much since people mostly answered val sensitve which was correct
7/11/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: If i made it already correct that wont do anything to my grade for example 😀
7/11/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I hope so, but im pretty sure they won't just give it to you. It's stated pretty seriously that 4.9=fail :/
7/11/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: They gotta draw a line somewhere
7/11/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Studyguide stated most things pretty clearly that they also changed afterwards
7/11/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Studyguide also stated they could come up with 60 questions that actually made sense
7/11/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But they decided 10% of their own brewings were retarded AFTER hundreds of students worked on them
7/11/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah true lol
7/11/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: The point is to find a question that didnt make sense and give a good argument about i
7/11/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: It*
7/11/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Not just begging for a free point
7/11/17, 11:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes
7/11/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, but we can try the latter If we fail 😂
7/11/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Bribe em
7/11/17, 11:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Buy them bier
7/11/17, 11:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Beer
7/11/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys quick question
7/11/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: does student OV sill work?
7/11/17, 11:46 - Luke Houben: Yea
7/11/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: Until the 16th
7/11/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I have a 5.4 overall and I passed the test 
Is it possible that they check the my group assignments again if I ask them
7/11/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: The history and the ethics
7/11/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Maybe...
7/11/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Probably should've done that before the final test
7/11/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, IDK if your BSA is in danger because of USE, but there is this rule that if you don't get your BSA because of a intermediate test, you can get extension
7/11/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: What is an extension ??
7/11/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, that you only have to get your BSA later
7/11/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I have 40 ects so far
7/11/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: So if i fail all them
7/11/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, say you fail automata and USE
7/11/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Then i i'd pass to y2 😁 ?
7/11/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then you still can get a BSA, because you failed USE on an intermediate test
7/11/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sec, I'll look up the relevant OER article
7/11/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
7/11/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ohhh i have an exact 5 for the final :(
7/11/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Then it does not work, sorry
7/11/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: But thank u !
7/11/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You gotta work your arse off for the resit, then :P
7/11/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Nahh 
If pass automata then I'll do it next year :D
7/11/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I*
7/11/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Week abbo geeft tussen 16 juli en 16 augustus altijd 40% korting, de andere weken werkt het gewoon als normaal en weekend abbo verandert helemaal niks
7/11/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Afaik
7/11/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: That is indeed correct
7/11/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Wacht, we hebben nog wel korting?
7/11/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Dat is echt ontzettend dikke prima
7/11/17, 12:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Yup
7/11/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Tis gwn kut dat weekend wel doorgaat en je niet meer mag switchen na mei of iets dergelijks
7/11/17, 12:21 - Luke Houben: You can switch twice a year, never heard something about switching after may
7/11/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Its not allowed
7/11/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Because in the holidays the weekendOV is still free
7/11/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: They want to prevent everyone switchen to weekend for the summer
7/11/17, 12:22 - Luke Houben: Ah nice to know, although it's too late now already😥
7/11/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: u can switch it after may
7/11/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: just not during the summer
7/11/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: so september is probs fine
7/11/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: https://duo.nl/particulier/student-hbo-of-universiteit/ov-en-reizen/van-abonnement-wisselen.jsp
7/11/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: u cant switch between 1 May and 25 Aug
7/11/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: but after 25 Aug u can switch back to week OV
7/11/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: <Media omitted>
7/11/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Yup
7/11/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: fucking cunts
7/11/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 5.2
7/11/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Best grade ever
7/11/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: @31634642931 you have done too much of work clearly tho
7/11/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Hahaha if reading the summary and doing every example exam once is too much work then yes
7/11/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: sorry for the perhaps stupid question, but say if I were to get 60 EC, where should I sign up to get my P? I'm still a bit confused why you have to sign up at all but I saw you guys talking about it
7/11/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Have a look in the slides op 2ic00
7/11/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: You have to mail someone
7/11/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: but you don't
7/11/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Voortgang -> diploma aanvragen op osiris
7/13/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
7/13/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31648187618
7/13/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: The is a mail with more text in it but this is the PDF attached with the mail
7/13/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: So you can't do assistantship if you didn't pass every course? It says "propadeuse obtained with good overall grades" 😥
7/13/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeaah
7/13/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I got it as well 😊
7/13/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Correct Dennis, although a personal mail will maybe fix this
7/13/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Works more than often
7/13/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: I will try, thanks Daan 😊
7/13/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Np! Most of the times rules are more guidelines to make sure they don't get 100 special requests
7/13/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Like if you have 45 ects then you are not suited
7/13/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But with a calculus fail I don't see why you couldn't help out with programming
7/13/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I reckon there will be few enough people applying that they will allow those with lower grades as well
7/13/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: I will hopefully have 45 ects after Friday 😅
7/13/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: And I passed programming with a 9, would like to do that yeah
7/13/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This yeah
7/13/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They have major shortages
7/13/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Fingers crossed
7/13/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Easy money 😜
7/13/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Uni pays incredibly well no?
7/13/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exactly
7/13/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pays 10 an hour
7/13/17, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or maybe even a bit more
7/13/17, 15:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 250 euro (  heard it from a guy tutori g comp systems)
7/13/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: From what I understand you can either get hourly or just a fixed amount, with the fixed amount it's just a matter of putting the least amount of hours in to get the biggest hourly rate
7/13/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: Anyone know when we ll know the automata gradrs for final test?
7/13/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Yes, before Saturday
7/13/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: Alright thanks
7/13/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: So, tomorrow
7/13/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Btw
7/13/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: For next year
7/13/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Before when do we need to submit for our subjects?
7/13/17, 16:59 - Luke Houben: 1 week before the start of Q1
7/13/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Nice how they give additional options for people who failed a course this year. For calculus there are 3 additional options :)
7/13/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Plebeians😤
7/13/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Still no ds?
7/13/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Im completely stressed out for ds but no
7/13/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Sander how many ects you need?
7/13/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: 5 more im at 40
7/13/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: 40 was enough for you right?
7/13/17, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Not yet officially so I prefer getting 5 more lol
7/13/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: still no automata?
7/13/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Nope
7/13/17, 19:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is Soviet Russia; no grades, no potato, only gulag and sadness
7/13/17, 19:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hahahaha
7/14/17, 08:21 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
7/14/17, 08:21 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Automata results are out
7/14/17, 08:28 - Luke Houben: Where can i find them? For some reason my phone can't open the fike
7/14/17, 08:28 - Luke Houben: file*
7/14/17, 08:30 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: On canvas then go to automata and then announcements
7/14/17, 08:35 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: 5.7 which was exactly what I needed😅😎
7/14/17, 08:39 - Luke Houben: Alright thanks
7/14/17, 08:39 - Luke Houben: 5.4, close enough
7/14/17, 08:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Fuys my automata is no longer in canvas ?
7/14/17, 08:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Is that normal
7/14/17, 08:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hello?
7/14/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Just click on courses and then on all courses
7/14/17, 08:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Like lol?
7/14/17, 08:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
7/14/17, 08:43 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Or open the canvas app on your phone
7/14/17, 08:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok resit it is
7/14/17, 08:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐸
7/14/17, 08:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What about ds ?

7/14/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That's harsh...
7/14/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: i passed with a 5.5, but i thought i'd have a 7
7/14/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: what is this grading
7/14/17, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: It seems like they werr really rough with grading
7/14/17, 12:18 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yep
7/14/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I knew I had at least part of questions 2b and 3b correct, but I only have a 2,9
7/14/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 2,7*
7/14/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That is also only 30 points right

7/14/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Well that's why you can look at your exam
7/14/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thats why you dont bank on having "part of a question correct"
7/14/17, 12:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I got 2 a correct 2 b most probably correct 3 a correct and 3 b wrong but with some right things..
7/14/17, 12:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Like 2 b is actualy correct for sure
7/14/17, 12:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Which makes belive that they were very harsh on the grading of the descriptive questions
7/14/17, 12:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Since i cant make 2a and 3 a wring since they are rules and shit

7/14/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Less
7/14/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Leander is the laziest cunt I have had the pleasure of encountering at TU/e, dude hasn't even returend the assignment grade after nearly a month
7/14/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ikr
7/14/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No clue what the guy does all day
7/14/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But enough complaining
7/14/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Dude didn't give a single lecture, gave tests that didn't need to be graded, used a multiple-choice test yet he's still slow
7/14/17, 22:41 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Does anyone have the apt test ??
7/14/17, 22:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Apt?
7/14/17, 22:46 - Luke Houben: Automata
7/14/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ah
7/14/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You could take it home right?
7/14/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I searched my bags again and found it 😅
I will send it here right now 4 those who need it
7/14/17, 22:49 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
7/14/17, 22:49 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
7/14/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Half an hour left 😄
7/14/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Did they postpone the deadline then or?
7/14/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well our deadline is 12 too
7/14/17, 23:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So they might be stretching it too lol
7/14/17, 23:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If I would still be getting a sufficient grade after the deadline I wouldn't even rush
7/14/17, 23:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And these people are getting paid either way
7/14/17, 23:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's a bit weird though that DS was so quick last time
7/14/17, 23:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And this time takes so long
7/14/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Might the same osiris troubles again though
7/14/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And this time they might not want to upload it to canvas
7/14/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Or Bettina took an early urlaub
7/14/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Wow @31643222030 u so smart

7/14/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: What if they do not upload the grades on time ?
7/14/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We can go and complain
7/14/17, 23:46 - Bas Gieling: probably nothing
7/14/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Too real
7/14/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But they prolly won't do anything with your complaints
7/14/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: They actually do
7/14/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: we should then all give a 0 for the evaluation
7/14/17, 23:47 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: But you won't hear about it
7/14/17, 23:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: That'll show em!!!!
7/14/17, 23:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hmm you're right Dante

7/15/17, 09:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I dont think they work in weekend
7/15/17, 09:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Expect them monday
7/15/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Also still no mmgo rip
7/15/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Does anyone know if you have to be available in time slot C AND D or only one of them for student assistant logic?
7/15/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes
7/15/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: pretty sure someone knwos
7/15/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: knows*
7/15/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And you have to be available in C or D
7/15/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Thanks!
7/15/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (That was a joke answer)
7/15/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: No thanks then!
7/15/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: It depends, if you opt for the homework grading assistantship you don't have to, otherwise you do. But I think if you are only available in one time slot you can tell them and maybe you'll still get the tutoring assistantship in your free slot
7/15/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Ah I thought every assistant had to do tutoring and homework checking
7/15/17, 22:01 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Ah maybe I'm not sure, because looking at it again it does entail 80 hours so you may be right, in that case I think you can still email them with the slots thing and maybe you can get a tutoring hour in only that slot which you are free in
7/15/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Yup did that already 👍🏻
thanks for the help

7/17/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: Yes, my final exam grade was the assignment grade instead of exam grade
7/17/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Would be nice
7/17/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Only the assignment and the final course grade

7/17/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Something went wrong
7/17/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: um i dont think the eindtoets grade is your actual final exam
7/17/17, 10:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: since if that was the case id have an 8,4

7/17/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Same
7/17/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: I think it's average and it automatically says 5 when you don't pass
7/17/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: On osiris?
7/17/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Yes

7/17/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: yep
7/17/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Good
7/17/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hakan
7/17/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You cannot be send away now anymore
7/17/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You're in for at least the comming few years now
7/17/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: there are people who are doing their fourth or fifth year and still not finished because of a first year subject
7/17/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: so you are good
7/17/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Damn
7/17/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How can you fail it that many times
7/17/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In TU Delft you are obligated to pass the P courses in the second year
7/17/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait does that mean thwe difficulty doesn't increase a lot?
7/17/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: or just plain stupid
7/17/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But they passed all other years
7/17/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Difficulty isn't gonna increase Daan?
7/17/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It's not high school
7/17/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Awesome
7/17/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You could have done HTI in your 3rd year
7/17/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That should explain enough
7/17/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
7/17/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Solid point
7/17/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Depends on the electives you choose
7/17/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I'm also pretty sure we have more level 2 and level 3 subjects in year 2 and 3 than in year 1
7/17/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: yes, but ultimately you could choose to arrange your subject in such a way that most of your level 1 subjects are in year 3. then it gets easier lol
7/17/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Don't most higher level courses have lower level prerequisites that will make placing most level 1 courses in year 3 impossible unless you add more years?
7/17/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is there an inzage for DS?
7/17/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: They first should give us the grades
7/17/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Those are online
7/17/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: On osiris
7/17/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I got an 4.8
7/17/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: 😔
7/17/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Awh that sucks man
7/17/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Yaaay still didnt pass
7/17/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is there an inzage where I can maybe get 1 extra point?
7/17/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They didn't give a date yet, but you can mail to try to make an appointment
7/17/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Anybody know what the test for p-colluqium is?
7/17/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Can u get the p next year
7/17/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
7/17/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Oki cool
7/17/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I had a 2,7 on the sheet, and a 7,4 on osiris. Does that mean I actually passed the course?
7/17/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Since they are so radically different
7/17/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: For automata they probably mixed up exam and assignment grades
7/17/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 👆🏻
7/17/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: The final mark is indeed the same as the one for the written onr
7/17/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Damn... almost got my hopes up
7/17/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I also got an email saying I am signed up for my propedeuse, even though I wouldn't have passed with the 2,7 that was on the online pdf, but which I would have with the 7,4 from issues
7/17/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Issues = osiris
7/17/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That email about p-colloquim test is just weird
7/17/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: When exactly is the resit of apt and what time ?
7/17/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: what time is test review for automata tomorrow?
7/17/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its a wednesday i heard
7/17/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but i havent received an email of enrollment yet?
7/17/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: should be automatic right?
7/17/17, 15:35 - ‪+30 697 453 5573‬: If you didn't pass one of the exams shouldn't you get an email for the resit?
7/17/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah thats what i thought
7/17/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but i never received one
7/17/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: anyone else with the same problem?
7/17/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ehh yeah me
7/17/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ah jij ook niet?
7/17/17, 15:40 - Bas Gieling: yea i didnt receive one either, but i wasnt at the test so i didnt get an insufficient grade, so that might be different
7/17/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
7/17/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah i have NVD...
7/17/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Even weirder
7/17/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jeah
7/17/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They probably add the final grades for the subject manually
7/17/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lel
7/17/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And the emails?
7/17/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: who do we have to mail in case this doesnt get fixed?
7/17/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Blowblowblow
7/17/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think
7/17/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i was thinking student administration
7/17/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Doesn't really matter haha. Usually they forward you if you mail the wrong person
7/17/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but not sure?
7/17/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ?
7/17/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ah okay
7/17/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I have no idea to be honest
7/17/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: anyone?
7/17/17, 15:44 - Bas Gieling: can you guys enroll for the resit tho? because i cant, even though i got permission from the study counselor
7/17/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or anyone who knows where i can find this
7/17/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not sure about this
7/17/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: couldnt find resit on osiris
7/17/17, 15:45 - Bas Gieling: same

7/17/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Its so annoying how they make resits in the middle of summer
7/17/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: true
7/17/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its also annoying that i still have received no grades at all for the intermediate assignment or the final examination of mmgo
7/17/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and i cant even find the guys email to complain
7/17/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: anyone else whose grade for automata on osiris is not correct?
7/17/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: everyone
7/17/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its the grade from ur assignment
7/17/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: no not even that
7/17/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: its just bullshit grades that do not correspond to the grades in the pdf
7/17/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Its the combination grade of the assigment and the mid term afaik
7/17/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: <Media omitted>
7/17/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not sure, so i sent him an email
7/17/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
7/17/17, 18:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Can someone translate it please
7/17/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: "dunno lel xP"
7/17/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Isn't the resit listed in De-register -> Tests on Osiris?
7/17/17, 18:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Seriously i will buy someone a beer if he translates
7/17/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: No that's the translation
7/17/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: ↑
7/17/17, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: He doesn't know
7/17/17, 18:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What ?
7/17/17, 18:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I dont kow dutch yet
7/17/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: The large part was Stef's stuff
7/17/17, 18:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah but i dont get that too
7/17/17, 18:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😬🙈
7/17/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: The part on the top is him saying "I don't know Stef"
7/17/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: It comes down to "dunno lel xP"
7/17/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: No more information is provided
7/17/17, 18:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah but what is stef asking ?
7/17/17, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: "What is happening with regards to the automata resit, I haven't been autamically registered"
7/17/17, 18:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh shit 😵
7/17/17, 18:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How do i check if i am ?
7/17/17, 18:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Wtf tue ....
7/17/17, 18:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: No one is apparently
7/17/17, 18:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: It'll happen in time and otherwise people here will complain
7/17/17, 18:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Free pass ? 🤷🏻‍♂
7/17/17, 18:49 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If you are registered something with automata and 2nd attempt should be in Overview registrations -> Tests
7/17/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: In registrations there is a link named resits
7/17/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: It should be there
7/17/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Thats how I did it
7/17/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Till when can we register for resits?
7/17/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Show screen plis
7/17/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Register -> Test -> Re-examinations or Search a test
7/17/17, 20:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So we have to register on our own ?
7/17/17, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Guess it will be takwn carw of, but just tk be sure yeah
7/17/17, 20:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: how do I do it then ? what anne said doesn't show anything
7/17/17, 20:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i mean it doesn't give me any option to register
7/17/17, 20:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
7/17/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Search a test should give more options
7/17/17, 20:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: do i search just automata?
7/17/17, 20:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can someone help ?
7/17/17, 20:31 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
7/17/17, 20:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ok when i go to search a test what do i do
7/17/17, 20:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i searched automata like this
7/17/17, 20:32 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Select Q4 version
7/17/17, 20:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
7/17/17, 20:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what now ? isn't that the normal exam?
7/17/17, 20:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: where do i even click
7/17/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
7/17/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Click on the name of the course
7/17/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Or the number
7/17/17, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Whatever works
7/17/17, 20:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
7/17/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Press register
7/17/17, 20:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: are you sure about it ?
7/17/17, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That's how I registered for resits up until now
7/17/17, 20:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: weren't you auto registered ?
7/17/17, 20:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: lol also you had resits ?
7/17/17, 20:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :\
7/17/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Voluntary ones yes
7/17/17, 20:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanks but i am paranoid i will make some mistake
7/17/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: >voluntary resits
7/17/17, 20:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: did anyone else register themselves?
7/17/17, 20:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @ANYONE :<
7/17/17, 20:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: guys?
7/17/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: @31624797029 probably
7/17/17, 20:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31643470096  did you do it ?
7/17/17, 20:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31630404358
7/17/17, 20:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31624553225
7/17/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 30404358‬: hey, no I didnt
7/17/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: You think you're funny, do you
7/17/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Then it will remain a mystery how you ended up at DS
7/17/17, 20:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So?
7/17/17, 20:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: anyone who did it
7/17/17, 20:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: anne did you do it ?
7/17/17, 20:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: probably not
7/17/17, 20:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31610720282
7/17/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Not for automata
7/17/17, 20:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i guess nothing bad will happen if i try right ?
7/17/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: But it can't be much different from DS for example
7/17/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nope
7/17/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: There's also a deregister page
7/17/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I didn't mean for automata
7/17/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: You didn't? I can't find what else you could have meant
7/17/17, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Do we have to register ?
7/17/17, 23:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ye
7/17/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Till when
7/17/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Can we rejister
7/18/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: for what
7/18/17, 09:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Automata resit
7/18/17, 09:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Idl but do it now just to be sure
7/18/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Just to double check , the USE resit takes place on the 14th of August yes ?
7/18/17, 15:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ye
7/18/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Do u know at what time exactly does it take place then , idk where to find it ?
7/18/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Resits are always 18:00 to 21:00, right?
7/18/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬: Nope, now they are at 13:30
7/18/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Okay 13.30 it is , thank you !
7/18/17, 15:40 - ‪+30 697 453 5573‬: Cause it's summer
7/18/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Waaaaay better time
7/18/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Seems fair, there are no other tests in this resit period so no reason to do them in the evening
7/18/17, 19:20 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Yh in the evening is really annoying
7/18/17, 20:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
7/18/17, 20:21 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I believe people who didn't get a good enough grade still weren't enrolled
7/18/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hmm not sure about that, but it would explain it for me
7/18/17, 20:22 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Yup
7/18/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: I didn't get enrolled for a resit for another course where I definitely didn't get a good enough grade either
7/18/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: So that's not the reason
7/18/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ah okay
7/18/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I.just enrolled anyway
7/18/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Yep that's the best bet

7/18/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Why do we have to enroll ourselves this time?
7/18/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: TU/error

7/18/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Accidentally selected the Dutch keyboard with autocorrect instead of one without, which is useful after having a drink too much but not when trying to type English
7/18/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Did*
7/18/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i did
7/18/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: conclusion: he doesnt know shit about all of this
7/18/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: spoke to him today
7/18/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: he really is slower than a turtle
7/18/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so either contact osiris helpdesk or just enroll manually and hope for the best i guess
7/18/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, you guys want some great news then?
7/18/17, 22:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Do you know who is probably gonna be the successor of Marloes van Lierop, the current program director?
7/18/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Well the way you are saying it doesn't make it sound like it will be Luttik
7/18/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You didn't mention that the grades online are wrong, right? That's something he could help to change
7/18/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no i kinda forgot to do that
7/18/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: which now feels really stupid
7/19/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Does anyone have an email to contact automata/vink
7/19/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
7/19/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Thanks!
7/19/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Before when do you need to manually register for automata resit?
7/19/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: U just go to people search and type whatever name u want
7/19/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I am not sure tbh but I'd do it as early as possible
7/19/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hmm will try to do it via mobile then
7/19/17, 22:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This
7/19/17, 23:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Just do it asap to be safe i guess
7/21/17, 07:01 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: In the email sent by STU , they mention that I should use my existing Studielink account. Where can I get its details ??
7/21/17, 07:45 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Login with you Tue on MyTU/e -> click studielink-> login with digid
7/21/17, 07:45 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Thank you so much ! :)
7/21/17, 07:49 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: But i dont have the details of the Digid ? 😅
7/21/17, 07:50 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Then you're fucked
7/21/17, 07:51 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: No if there is no other login option just call the tue at 040 247 47 47 and explain and if any one can help you it's them (it's the number of STU)
7/21/17, 07:52 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Yes ok 
But when did they send the details of the Digid thing ?
7/21/17, 07:52 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Maybe it is an email I missed or sth
7/21/17, 07:53 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Are you Dutch ?
7/21/17, 07:53 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: No 😅
7/21/17, 07:53 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Then you don't have it
7/21/17, 07:54 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: It's a Dutch way of an ID/passport for online stuff like your study
7/21/17, 07:55 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Phew 😅
What are my options as an international student ?
7/21/17, 07:55 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Idk but STU does
7/21/17, 07:55 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I would say call them on the number above
7/21/17, 07:55 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ok gr8
7/21/17, 09:33 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: You could get one my mail like i did as an international
7/21/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: By*
7/21/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Did u request that or did they send it , Isil ?
7/21/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I didnt get one :( 
And it is not attached in the email they sent to inform me of the enrollment
7/21/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I had needed to use studielink when applying to another dutch uni
7/21/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: But im sure there is another way forninternationals
7/21/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Let me see my digid account again
7/21/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Since i used it before i got digid im sure there is a way to have a studielink account apart from digid login
7/21/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
7/21/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I'll see what I can do 
Thx isil ! :)
7/21/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Can u resit exams for which you got >5.5?
7/21/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Osiris just shows everything <5.5
7/21/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah you'll have to ask Anne😂
7/21/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I believe you can always do the resit
7/21/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Anne did (or wanted to do) a resit for an exam for with her final grade was just short of a 10
7/21/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys, can we still apply for the resit for automata 16th of august ?
7/21/17, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Or am i too late
7/21/17, 22:45 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Indeed, I did the resit for Data Structures
7/21/17, 22:45 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
7/21/17, 22:45 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Register -> Tests -> Re-examinations -> Search a test on Osiris may work
7/21/17, 22:45 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Question is, did you get that 10?
7/21/17, 22:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: <Media omitted>
7/21/17, 22:46 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: As final grade for ds, yes
7/21/17, 22:46 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Damn👏🏻👏🏻
7/21/17, 22:46 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Seems like it, you can also check registrations at Overview registrations in Osiris
7/21/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Ah thank u
7/24/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Is anyone else going to switch from web science to software science?
7/24/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: What's the point?
7/24/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I have some problems with the re-enrollment in studielink
7/24/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Because i can only re-enroll for webscience
7/24/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Or i can sign up for a new program but I can only select the new bachelor computer science and engineering from there 😕
7/24/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I tried this to register for the resit of automata, but I can't find it in there, anyone knows how I can register for the resit?
7/24/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I also tried courses > 2it70 > 4th quartile > register for test > final examination opportunity 2(and then register at the bottom of the page), but that gives me the following line: You have reached the maximum number of enrollments that is allowed for test Final examination. Enrollment is not possible.
7/24/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I got automatically registered
7/24/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I just saw I got an email about being registered too
7/24/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: like, 45 mins ago I received it
7/24/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: nvm then, it seems like I'm already registered for the resit
7/25/17, 22:14 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, need help
Does anyone know how much non-eu ppl should pay for academic year 2017-2018? 
It was not stated in the email they've sent
7/25/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 10k
7/25/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: https://www.tue.nl/studeren/studeren-aan-de-tue/studiekosten/collegegeld-2017-2018/

7/25/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Is it that much of a difference
7/25/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, that's the cost of your education as well
7/25/17, 22:19 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yea 2016-2017 was the same
7/25/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But for EU students, the Dutch government sponsors 7.5k/student/year
7/25/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (This is for technical universities, regular ones are about 6k/student/year)
7/25/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Damn did not know that
7/25/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
7/25/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah cause they want us

7/26/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: does everyone still have this message on osiris?
7/26/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
7/26/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah you need to re-enroll in studielink
7/26/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Every year
7/26/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah i already did everything on studielink
7/26/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They assume you quit if you don't
7/26/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I did nothing
7/26/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: finished it like two weeks ago
7/26/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's osiris administration
7/26/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: loool tru
7/26/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They have a couple of weeks delay with the rest of the world
7/26/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: was just curious
7/26/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
7/26/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks for the headsu
7/26/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Forgot I had to re enroll
7/26/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: lol
7/26/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Before when do you need to do that?
7/26/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not sure
7/26/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i think in special cases it can be done almost until the end
7/26/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so, after enrolling through studielink, it should be fixed automatically, right?
7/26/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but it definately needs to be done before sept. 4th
7/26/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: after that its not possible anymore
7/26/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I mean, after the money is actually deducted from your account that is
7/26/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: should be, but so far it hasnt been fixed so idk
7/26/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: maybe it has to do with them not having received the payment for the next year yet?
7/26/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: or something like that
7/26/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: maybe like daan said
7/26/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: they live 4 weeks in the past
7/26/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: September 1 is deadline
7/26/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: where do i check this?
7/26/17, 22:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Osiris homepage
7/26/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
7/26/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Idk for me it shows that when i go to osiris.tue.nl
7/26/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I reenrolled but am not sure the payment has happened yet, it's still red for me. Not really worrying about it though, last time they also fucked up with the planapp and took the blame themselves.
7/26/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: If you re enrolled you have proof
7/26/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: So they can't do anything I suppose
7/26/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Date for payment is in conformation message on studielink, right? Somewhere next academic year
7/26/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No idea
7/26/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I got sent an accept email by tue
7/26/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: like 2-3 days after entering info on studielink
7/26/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Thats cuz they like you more ❤
7/26/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: aw :3
7/26/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or they know how he will freak out and try to avoid that
7/26/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: nah, they just wanted my 2 grand so they could continue building atlas
7/26/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You only have to re enroll right? Not change your study from propedeusebachelor to normal bachelor
7/26/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: If that is even possible
7/26/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Atlas? The main building ?
7/26/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Because on planapp propedeusebachelor was only the first year and the others were just called bachelor
7/26/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yeh
7/26/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I did not get that option I beleive
7/26/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: No me neither. But maybe you have to change your study or smthing
7/26/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I logged in, said I wanted to continue my program and suck up more tax payer's money for another year and then give the uni sme of my sucked up money
7/26/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yeah me too, I guess its alright then
7/26/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: The re enrollment part, not the part where we give money
7/26/17, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
7/27/17, 13:45 - Luke Houben: How can freshmen become a member of GEWIS already? Or is that not possible yet?
7/27/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Dunno

8/5/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 41585979‬: Does anyone know where i can find info about when you can review the test from automata? Or did it already happen?

8/5/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Yeah
8/6/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: Hey guys! Do you know when and where we need to register for the subjects in the first quartile?
8/6/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Where do you think??
8/6/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Osiris ofc

8/6/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Deadline is august 20?
8/6/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Oh deadline I have no idea.. this info is surely on last kick-off meeting slides
8/6/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys for the first courses of the next quartile can you just enroll? Even though the planapp hasn't done shit?
8/6/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: 💩
8/6/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Planapp does nothing
8/6/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You can select different stuff at any times
8/6/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's just for a general idea
8/6/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: planapp in a nutshell
8/6/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So how do you know which subjects you have?
8/6/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: S P A M
8/6/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well you chose them right?
8/6/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yes
8/6/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But if they are not confirmed that I can take them?
8/6/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: And I can switch them around any time I please?
8/6/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well it should have been approved afaik but since the planapp is the biggest disaster since chernobyl we're kinda just hoping for the best I guess
8/6/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Do you have to do anything when you got your P? I got the one from Web Science but not yet for Software Science. I get that if I pass Automata
8/6/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Register for p exam
8/6/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Aah okay
8/6/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Thanks
8/6/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
8/6/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Especially the first red line
8/6/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, they created a new USE line for 2017-2018
8/6/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And that course is a part of that
8/6/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So I can just pick it?
8/6/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And everything will be fine?
8/6/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, there is a waiting list
8/6/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But yes, you can
8/6/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well fuck
8/6/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I wanna do it in first quartile ;/
8/6/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: There are 2 people on the waiting list iirc
8/6/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Do we hve to register for all courses or only for Q1 atm?
8/6/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Only Q1
8/6/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: But you can always registered for the whole year just to get it over with
8/6/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Ye
8/6/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Exactly this
8/6/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I gave up on the new USE line and just chose Robots Everywhere, same quartiles as the new one...
8/6/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Apparently only Physics students received a mail in June about signing up early for the new USE line
8/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Because there are only 100 slots available
8/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That discrimination
8/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Only 100 students can follow it*
8/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Yup.
8/6/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In the current society this is a big no-go
8/6/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nice
8/6/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: The whole TUe communication is a no go
8/6/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
8/6/17, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Im getting really tired of this bullshit already
8/6/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Is there anyone in the tue where i can complain about this?
8/6/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And actually be heard
8/6/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The new USE line you mean?
8/6/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Throughout the year I noticed they have set up a really strong chain of "just keep blaming others"
8/6/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Got circled multiple times
8/6/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What the actual fuck
8/6/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm gonna email bloo about it
8/6/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I specifically chose this track because it fits with my bachelor
8/6/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They can go fuck themselves
8/6/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Instead of us
8/6/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No about TUe communication in general
8/6/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you need backup names just add mine
8/6/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Makes the point stronger 😂
8/6/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You mean the absolute absence of communication? :P
8/6/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll just send a normal email first and if that doesn't do the trick I'll ask for some backup ;)
8/6/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What is communication?
8/6/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yes
8/6/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: I was on time with signing up for the new USE line but apparantly you had to sign up for the individual subjects too...
8/6/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: A Physics student had send me the emails about it..
8/6/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Could you show me the email please?
8/6/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll wipe out any names etc
8/6/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just to make our case a bit stronger
8/6/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: I am searching for it. Just a sec
8/6/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ty!
8/6/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: You can also add my name under any complaint mail without asking me
8/6/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: U have my permission
8/6/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: LOL
8/6/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: <Media omitted>
8/6/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: This is one, but they probably got more.
8/6/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: Their faculty is responsible for the new USE line, so that's why their students got all the information needed. They don't care about us...
8/6/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, we have an e-mail address for this stuff
8/6/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Co@gewis.nl
8/6/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (Please don't say "dear Patricia" anymore tho, she isn't co anymore)
8/6/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I have asked bloo about this earlier, he didn't know anything about a smaller capacity or email and told me I could just sign up for the course. This was in early july
8/6/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I only signed up for my courses today, however
8/6/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I'm still gonna complain about it lol
8/6/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So I guess the gewis CO is a better idea
8/6/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm just gonna mail both
8/6/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lol same
8/6/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: S P A M
8/7/17, 01:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Shit
8/7/17, 01:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What time is automata tomorrow
8/7/17, 01:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The inzage
8/7/17, 01:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 13:30
8/7/17, 01:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and it's today
8/7/17, 01:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You da man
8/7/17, 01:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh cool
8/7/17, 01:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Correct
8/7/17, 01:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sweet dreams 😘
8/7/17, 01:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: cu there
8/7/17, 06:29 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: @31648187618 Entire day: busses between tilburg and ehv
8/7/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: More like busses between ehv and the rest of human civilization
8/7/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Your kidding man
8/7/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fuck that 😂
8/7/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And we still have to pay?
8/7/17, 09:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then the car is cheaper and way quicker 👍🏻
8/7/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: No clue
8/7/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: There were already quite some people waiting for the bus at 6am
8/7/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You still have to pay, yes
8/7/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, train is still cheaper
8/7/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do we get the discount or not?
8/7/17, 09:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You get the discount, yeah
8/7/17, 09:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But then a return trip is still €8.60, and car is 10 euros
8/7/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You sure? It's 39 km from my house which is mostly highway
8/7/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Current Hyundai i10 does 1:20 easily
8/7/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So 4 liters
8/7/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay, then nvm
8/7/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is less than 8,60
8/7/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I was using 13 km/l
8/7/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Haha oops, I know the feel
8/7/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (Which is the figure I have to use)
8/7/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I am doubting now what to do
8/7/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It belongs to gf's mother but it is cheaper and way way quicker
8/7/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Anyone from Tilburg who wants to join me to automata? Even cheaper to carpool
8/7/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I passed the test so idk of I wanna even look at it
8/7/17, 09:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I wouldn't
8/7/17, 09:36 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeh I never looked into any test tbh so was kinda curious😂
8/7/17, 09:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I only did when I failed them :p
8/7/17, 09:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Car
8/7/17, 09:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah I've decided haha
8/7/17, 09:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Was an easy call
8/7/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: Does anyone know where the 'inzage' is for automata?
8/7/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: MF 6.075
8/7/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 13:30-14:30
8/7/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: Thx
8/7/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Are the exact dates for the resits known yet?
8/7/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You can find them on mytimetable.tue.nl
8/7/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We asked Vink whether the resit will look the same as the original
8/7/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He gave a complicated reply which basically meant I am not gonna tell you but yes
8/7/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: this is what he told me: 
"The resit is in the same line. It has new assignments, of course, but one on proving one on the listed theorems, one on an application of the Pumping Lemma, and one on LTS and deciding branching bisimulation. "
8/7/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: My automata resit is not in mytimetable
8/7/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: But I am registered for it in osiris
8/7/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yup, me as well
8/7/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: mine is also not there
but as long as we're registered it should be fine
8/7/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Okay good 😊
8/7/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: It should be aug16 anyway
8/7/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: yup 13:30 if I recall correctly
8/7/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is good, means we get 10 free points for pumping lemma again 😋
8/7/17, 15:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Where is it
8/7/17, 15:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What room?
8/7/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Vink's office
8/7/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 6.75 iirc
8/7/17, 15:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Nooo 😅 i mean the resit
8/7/17, 15:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Is it again audi or ?
8/7/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ooh 😂
8/7/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No idea
8/7/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Around 30 people making a resit in his small office space
8/7/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Cosy and fraudproof
8/7/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: More i think
8/7/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: About 40% iirc
8/7/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: hmm thats not an awfull lot
8/7/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: 130 resits out of 303 according to Vink
8/7/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: You forgot the 1 in front
8/7/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ah nice
8/8/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 43952455‬ left
8/8/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: what is the subject code for the p exam?
8/9/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no clue
8/9/17, 19:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: does it have one?
8/9/17, 20:27 - ‪+31 6 14599419‬: Garnicht

8/9/17, 22:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Too late for what?
8/9/17, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: apologize
8/9/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: its too late now to say sorry
8/9/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Cause im missing more than just your body
8/9/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Register for p exam
8/9/17, 23:03 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Not gonna lie when I registered for my p exam I didn't get any form of confirmation
8/9/17, 23:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: And I didn't bother mailing them so now I'm just waiting until I hear something
8/9/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I did not get a confirmation, so I mailed then yesterday
8/9/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: They said it was okay
8/9/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: So no confimation is okay
8/9/17, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ty

8/10/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: AKA: We nemen het mee, krijg de vinkentering want het collegejaar begint al over een halve maand -.-
8/10/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Wel that is just great
8/10/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Our planning have not been accepted yet as well is suppose?
8/10/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Doesn't have to be accepted
8/10/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That would imply a TU/e system working as intended
8/10/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: You can just register for any course you want in osiris
8/10/17, 13:00 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: And when is the deadline for registering for courses for the first quartile?
8/10/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 20th august
8/10/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: So what do you guys think? Switch to another use package without waiting time like robotics? Or wait for follow up from Bloo?
8/10/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: before when do we have to apply for the subjects, and does anyone have pdf's or something of the books?
8/10/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: if we need any
8/10/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: .
8/10/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I hope you're joking, right?
8/10/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Hahahahaha
8/10/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Anyone know where i can find the answers of first automata test? I thought they were online somewhere
8/10/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Also, do you guys think the resit is gonna be on the same topics but diff questions? So pumping lemma at question 2 and LTS at question 3 and a random theory question 1? Or might it be different this time
8/10/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: .
8/10/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: same type of questions but he said he'd want to fuck over people who had to take a resit so expect harder examples
8/10/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: gotta love the man
8/10/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Ok.. :(
8/10/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Xd
8/10/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: And the answers of the firs test, can you find em online?
8/10/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: I think he is just saying this so people will learn harder and pass the test 🤔
8/10/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: I hope so
8/10/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: no the smile on his face told me otherwise
8/10/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: rip xd
8/10/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sounds like Vink anyway?
8/10/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: I like to give myself a little hope🙌🏻😂
8/10/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: But are there answers of the first test online? Still dont know lol
8/10/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: I dont know
Would be nice though🤔
8/10/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Thought there was, cant find it though
8/11/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: im on the waiting list atm, has there been any news/response from bloo about this?
8/11/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm on the waiting list as well
8/11/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He's diggin into it
8/11/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: hmm alright
8/11/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yeah I decided to wait a little longer
8/11/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: So also still on the waiting list
8/11/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Does it say a position for you guys?
8/11/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
8/11/17, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: nop for me neither
8/11/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Me too thanks
8/11/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Same
8/11/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys
8/11/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: What is the exact date, time and location for automata resit ?
8/11/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Can't see it in my timetable
8/11/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope, everyone has that
8/11/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or, at least, I don't have it as well
8/11/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So someone send Vink an email
8/11/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Date 16.08 at least
8/11/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Same
8/11/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Time 13.30
8/12/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
8/12/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but its not in MyTimetable...?
8/12/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Same for me
8/12/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: RIP us
8/12/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: I'm kind of used to these things now tbh. I assume that everything they say doesn't work in some way. Makes you never be disappointed anymore, at least in uni
8/12/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Very philosofical Luuk
8/12/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: No spam pls

8/12/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Spam Turtle plz kick
8/12/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Luuk is being all philosophical n shit
8/12/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I mean, we're studying computer science
8/12/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Not applied philosophy
8/12/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Anyone know where i can find the use test, ik the answers are online but wheres the actual test questions?
8/12/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Why would they send the answer key but not the actual test?
8/12/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so that people who took their answers with them could check em at home
8/12/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: they are not going to release the questions i suppose
8/12/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: will probably be new weekly material for next year
8/12/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: You weren't allowed to take anything home at all
8/12/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: So that answer key was just pure fuckery
8/12/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: So how do i practice for my resit? There is 1 exam they offer from last year but i already did it before doing the first exam
8/12/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Basis test questions in cs students
8/12/17, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: oh lol in that case i didnt say anything
8/12/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Basis test questions? Ok i can try i guess, btw in some questions they talk about specific things mentioned in the book, how am k supposed to even remember them?
8/12/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: have you ever looked in this chat before lol
8/12/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i think theres something for that onc s student
8/12/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Saw a file with all the cases
8/12/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: But this for example
8/12/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: This question is about the urban planning of paris by Haussman..
8/12/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Like..
8/12/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ur not
8/12/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: they do ask some questions that are too specific yes
8/12/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but in the final they took out all but one of them afterwards
8/12/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: since everyone complained about it basically
8/12/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so be sure to write down that its a stupid question
8/12/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: How did i still get a 4.3 then lol anyways i guess its just gonna be annoying, yeah i will complain for sure
8/12/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz they will check and see which questions were most struggled with, so that they can eleminate these kind of quesitons (dunno why they do it afterwards, cuz every idiot can see that but mkay...)
8/12/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Yrp
8/12/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Yep
8/12/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its gonna be annoying anyway, you just need to get lucky i guess
8/12/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It wasn't :p
8/12/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ah, nvm
8/12/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Vink told me that technically you are always allowed to take a picture of your work when the exam ends
8/12/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because it is your own material
8/12/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh okay but when there are some senile old fucks watching you I'd rather not take a picture of something 😂
8/12/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: After the timer ends and you put down your pen you can grab your phone
8/12/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Those senile old fucks will of course start complaining but they cannot do shit
8/12/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Well if anyone made photos of the questions of the use test, they are welcome, i kinda wanna redo it to see if i would pass this time
8/12/17, 19:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No not the questions, your own work
8/13/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so does anyone know where the automata resit will be?
8/13/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz its nice of them to say that it might have changed, but not so nice that i dont know where we are supposed to be...

8/13/17, 10:50 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 💩
8/13/17, 10:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yes sir
8/13/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 0^m means that there are m 0's, making the length m
8/13/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: same goes for 0^2m, this is 2m  0's making the total length m+2m = 3m
8/13/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: then 0^3m which makes the length 3m + 3m = 6m
8/13/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and two times a 1
8/13/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: makes a length of 6m + 2
8/13/17, 10:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: holy shit I am legit autistic thanks
8/13/17, 10:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ❤
8/13/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hahaha
8/13/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: np, in a way arent we all?
8/13/17, 10:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i guess :D
8/13/17, 11:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
8/13/17, 12:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: anyone ?
8/13/17, 12:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ">
8/13/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: I did not see a mistake but I think it's better to state in front of the case distinction that you're going to pump "vy" because the case distinction is a bit random now. Also after the case distinction you should conclude "there is no such m as used in the pumping lemma. Therefore we conclude... not a cfl".

But yeah I dont know if they really care about it but still writing it down can't harm;)
8/13/17, 13:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thank you :3
8/13/17, 13:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
8/13/17, 13:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and is there a shorter way to prove it other than case distinction and listing the possibilities?
8/13/17, 13:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: context free language*
8/13/17, 14:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: its sooo cold here
8/13/17, 14:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :< library is colder than its supposed to have you guys noticed
8/13/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: nope
8/13/17, 14:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31623837581  it has 6 cases right? 
Only a's
Only b's
Only c's
a's and b's
a's and c's
b's and c's
8/13/17, 14:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Or do i have another case with a's , b's and c's?
8/13/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: in the most simple form of the example it would indeed only cover those cases

8/13/17, 14:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31623837581 🤓

8/13/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Thanks!
8/13/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Should I be worried that I didn't get that email though 🤔
8/13/17, 19:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Idk they probably made a mistake
8/13/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is really the most common line when talking about TUe administration 😂
8/13/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Oh I thought we were talking about their parents
8/13/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: They also made a mistake yes
8/13/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: The whole generation is a mistake
8/13/17, 20:02 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Does anyone have a file of all cases we need to know for use resit? Theres a file on csstudents, but it doesnt seem to have nearly all of em
8/13/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: U kinda need to know all the cases mentioned in the chapters we are responsible of
8/13/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: But i dont see any other file than the cs-students one
8/13/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Oh then csstudents might have all of em forgot we dont need to know all chapters
8/13/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: It are all the cases 
Just the numbers are different
Because of other versions or something
8/13/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: There's the reading guide on canvas
8/13/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: <Media omitted>
8/13/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: All the cases in the book?
8/13/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: Ow wait srry use cases
Saw cases as the proof stuff from automata😅
8/13/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: 😄😬😬
8/13/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: 🙈
8/13/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Btw do u know what problem of paralysis is? Couldnt find it in book
8/13/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Probably when you don't do anything
8/13/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: But why should we know that when it's not in the book?
8/13/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: It was in the 2015 exam
8/13/17, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Did they change the book
8/13/17, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: i think so
8/13/17, 20:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Isnt problem of paralysis when no action can be taken from any memebr of the party/group in order to fix something without causing another problem for yourself or other party members ? I am making a wild guess of what i vaguely remeber. But i might as well be wrong 💩
8/13/17, 20:16 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I thought that it was like nobody wants to do anything because they don't want to deal with the risk
8/13/17, 20:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh yeah you hot it more right

8/14/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Anytime ;)
8/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: is assignment 2 of the automata resit supposed to have the same format?
8/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
8/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes it is
8/14/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Name the pumping lemma is 10 points again
8/14/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: because 2016 exam, 2016 exemplary have it, but 2016 retake doesnt
8/14/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just a different application example of course
8/14/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Vink more or less said it would be the same
8/14/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: aight
8/14/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He said we can expect a proof, an application for the pumping lemma for CFL and drawing an LTS and color scheme
8/14/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So that means the same structure
8/14/17, 14:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what if he trolled us ant its not going to be the same?
8/14/17, 14:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what if he bait us ?
8/14/17, 14:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can we complain then or would we be fucked?
8/14/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: if he said that I dont think he would mislead us
8/14/17, 14:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I don't think so either but I still get mikko kartunen flashbacks
8/14/17, 14:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and in case it happens what do we do then?
8/14/17, 14:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: nothing ?
8/14/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I suspect that he could include a context free one and then it would be the same format but we would need to provide the grammar
8/14/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: nothing
8/14/17, 14:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what do you mean Daniel?
8/14/17, 14:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can you give example of such exercise ?
8/14/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You would then also need to prove it aside from just giving the grammar Daniel
8/14/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And that proof would be a pain in the ass from what I know
8/14/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: <Media omitted>
8/14/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: If L is context-free it asks to provide a grammar
8/14/17, 14:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: how is that context free :D
8/14/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: in not
8/14/17, 14:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yeah but its never context free :D
8/14/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: but on the exam it could be i guess
8/14/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
8/14/17, 14:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: that would suck duck
8/14/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: theyre not gonna do that
8/14/17, 14:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: it would be so long to do
8/14/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: never before but he changed the 2016 resit so I expect something to be different
8/14/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz they know no one can
8/14/17, 14:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: stef that's optimistic but maybe that's exactly why he can do it
8/14/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: in the one I sent it says argue not proove
8/14/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: true, but he said that this one will be the same
8/14/17, 14:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and then we ded
8/14/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: to multiple people
8/14/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: probz he got loads of complaints about the difference between normal and resit
8/14/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: it would technically be the same type of question
8/14/17, 14:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: gods be with us and papa bless my nice pen that makes me write more than I usualy do
8/14/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: providing generating grammar is easy anyways
8/14/17, 14:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :|
8/14/17, 14:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: excuse me ?
8/14/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no clue how lol
8/14/17, 14:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: grammar idk but proof is deffinately impossibru
8/14/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: there are some excersises in the reader
8/14/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: yeah the proof is hard
8/14/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: but in the test said argue not prove
8/14/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: When I asked him about how this year's resit is gonna be and he said that it's gonna be the same as the first exam, I also specifically mentioned that last year's resit was different, so he probably would've said something about it if it was dfferent this year too
8/14/17, 14:30 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: you mean the 2 exercises that are context free and their explaination spreads across 4 pages ?
8/14/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: good to know
8/14/17, 14:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I really hope he doesn't make us prove shit and give grammer because its long and hard as hell and also exercise 1 is timeconsuming enough already
8/14/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: He said exercise 2 is about the pumping lemma so no worries again
I'm pretty sure it's gonna be the same
8/14/17, 14:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: papa bless :>
8/14/17, 14:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: give me some tips about exercise 1
8/14/17, 14:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: do I just memorize the shit out of the 12 variants
8/14/17, 14:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: imo 1 is the hardest exercise and I have no idea wtf to do apart from memorizing it
8/14/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: 3.2.3 is the one a) is easy b) is hard
8/14/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I mean providing grammar not the proofs
8/14/17, 14:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what about exercise 1
8/14/17, 14:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :(
8/14/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: you could learn the base cases at least
8/14/17, 14:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: that's not very promising
8/14/17, 14:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :D
8/14/17, 14:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: whats that like 5 points :D
8/14/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That could be the difference between a 4,5 and a 5
8/14/17, 14:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yeah I guess
8/14/17, 14:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: still any tips about ex 1?
8/14/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Specifically learn the proofs where you can prove it in a way that it can come on the test. Every excercise 1 has an a-part and a b-part so that leaves some proofs more suitable to put in the test than others
8/14/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: At least thats how i looked at learning the proofs
8/14/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Got me a 9.2 🤓
8/14/17, 14:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: GIVE ME YOUR EXTENDED TIPS NOW AND I WILL BUY YOU A KEG OF BEER IF IT HELPS
8/14/17, 14:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: NAW !
8/14/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: I mean excercise 3 is just doing those lts excercises a bit and then you can do it flawlessly every time, same goes for excercise 2 imo :s
8/14/17, 14:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yes i agree about 2 and 3
8/14/17, 14:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but what about 1
8/14/17, 14:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: give me your deep  knowledge
8/14/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: 1 for me at least was understanding how every proof was built up, like first do a base then in IH you first say what you wanna proof (like splitting the derivation up in n steps and then 1 or the other way around). Then you proof the n part by first declaring variables etc.
8/14/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Hope it helps a bit at least 😓
8/14/17, 14:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanks
8/14/17, 14:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i hope so
8/14/17, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: florian, how did you do the b part of exercise 1 then?
8/14/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: How do you mean? I knew how to proof it, like at some point all those proofs just clicked with me
8/14/17, 16:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: smart

8/14/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Idk i think im gonna start with learning every base case as they are quite easy to remember
8/14/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: If its 5 points like u said its worth it
8/14/17, 16:52 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: base case gives you 0.1 from your grade :>
8/14/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: 5 points is 0.1 of grade?
8/14/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Thougt 0.5
8/14/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: It is 0.5
8/14/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I just didnt do mine completely correct
8/14/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: I ll take a free 0.5
8/14/17, 16:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oh in that case good

8/14/17, 18:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Let me send pic

8/14/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Wait do you have to include the steps from the state you can go to with T?
8/14/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Cuz that would explain why i failed previous exam
8/14/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I am not 100% sure but once Tao goes to a different color, the next transitions become unavailable
8/14/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: but I believe that doesnt happen in the test we took
8/14/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: But when the toa goes to the same then you have to include the next transitions?
8/14/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Same color*
8/14/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: yes
8/14/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Okay ty
8/14/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: but only if tao is first
8/14/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: if it is after lets say transition a you dont count does ones
8/14/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Thnx
8/14/17, 18:13 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: If someone could compare my answer with their own for A3 from the last exam it would be great

8/14/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: another mistake I made on the test is that in part a) they ask for the LTS before hiding b and d
8/14/17, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: They always do that
8/14/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I think they gave me 0 points for this, but I couldnt see my exam
8/14/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: this one is fully correct indeed
8/14/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: what's the best code editor for web design?

8/14/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: is that a code editor?
8/14/17, 22:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Brackets is specifically aimed at web dev yeah
8/14/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I really like it
8/14/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: atom.io is pretty good as well
8/14/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: If u use the right pacxkages
8/14/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: atom is more of an editor instead of an IDE
8/14/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: At least the way I use it
8/14/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: then u're using it wrong 😜
8/14/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I don't like Atom
8/14/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I used it quite a lot
8/14/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, I use atom for small edits in config files n stuff, an IDE for the rest
8/14/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But when dealing with larger files it gets quite slow
8/14/17, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I don't like u
8/14/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Suck Nick

8/14/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Suck a nick
8/15/17, 00:35 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: i'm in love with brackets
8/15/17, 00:35 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: thank you
8/15/17, 00:35 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: it's a lot like my previous editor, sublime text 2
8/15/17, 00:35 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: just more powerful
8/15/17, 00:36 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: and the extensions are awesome :D
8/15/17, 00:36 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: i just want to move that right sidebar to the left
8/15/17, 00:37 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: as i use the scroll bar a lot, because it's quicker than the scroll wheel
8/15/17, 00:37 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Get a mouse with free scrolling
8/15/17, 00:41 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: g602 is the only mouse i'll take
8/15/17, 00:41 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: can't miss the buttons

8/15/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
8/15/17, 14:54 - Bas Gieling: yea that seems to be wrong
8/15/17, 14:55 - Bas Gieling: it should be "contains at least one b" id say
8/15/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: which one should be contains at least one b? the first or the second case? or do you mean the new case?
8/15/17, 14:57 - Bas Gieling: the second case
8/15/17, 14:58 - Bas Gieling: if you change k>0 to k>=0 its basically correct
8/15/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can you explain why?
8/15/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I don't really understand it
8/15/17, 14:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: no
8/15/17, 14:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: you get it wrong
8/15/17, 15:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: you don't need to show if its only a's and then a separate case for only b's because they are basicly the same case just different letter
8/15/17, 15:01 - Bas Gieling: well that just covers any possibility for vxy

either it entirely consists of a's

or it doesnt entirely consist of a's and henct contains at least one b
8/15/17, 15:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: you can have case 1 vand y contain only a's or only b's and then it would be the same
8/15/17, 15:01 - Bas Gieling: you would at least have to argue that those cases are the same dimitar
8/15/17, 15:01 - Bas Gieling: not just ignore it entirely
8/15/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so writing it down for only a's and a case for only b's, and a case for both a's and b's is not needed, but it won't be seen as wrong?
8/15/17, 15:02 - Bas Gieling: nope thats correct too joost
8/15/17, 15:02 - Bas Gieling: just more elaborate
8/15/17, 15:02 - Bas Gieling: but maybe easier to argue
8/15/17, 15:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yes you can say that case of only a's and case of only b's is are identical with the amount of a's and b's being mismatching in the end
8/15/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: thats what im going to do then
8/15/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Guys, how would you write the conclusion for the Context-free language proof, that a language is not context-free
8/15/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Because in this example, the picture above, is not enough right?
8/15/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: At least I had more than that, and I got points reducted :/
8/15/17, 15:04 - Bas Gieling: i think thats enough, maybe add that you can conclude that the pumping lemma does not hold for L and thus it is not context free
8/15/17, 15:04 - Bas Gieling: what did you have?
8/15/17, 15:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Since the language provided does not follow the pumping lemma L is not CFL
8/15/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but you should write down that you have covered all the cases with this
8/15/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, I did that, but I think you have to state there 'exists no such m' etc.
8/15/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I had 'by the pumping lemma of context-free languages, it is now proven that L is not context free'
8/15/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And this was not correct
8/15/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: At least, not entirely
8/15/17, 15:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think the best way to end is that    " Since there exists i>=0 where uv^2xy^2z is not from L then by the pumping lemma the language L is not context free
8/15/17, 15:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i mean uv^ixy^iz is not from L *
8/15/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You should just prove that there is no case in which it can be pumped and still be part of L
8/15/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Then you can conclude by the PL for CFLs thay its not context free
8/15/17, 15:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: not really in order to be context free all cases need to follow the pumping lemma so giving an example where it doesn't and argumenting it is enough
8/15/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No not all cases need to follow
8/15/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
8/15/17, 15:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: there can be a case where it is following pumping lemma but as long as there is atleast 1 where its not following pumping memma THEN its not CFL
8/15/17, 15:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i think me and stef are saying the same thing :D
8/15/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If by case you mean string, then yes
8/15/17, 15:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: yes string
8/15/17, 15:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: sawrey :<
8/15/17, 15:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :}
8/15/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No
8/15/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You say this covers  cases
8/15/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But you dont give a reason for that conclusion
8/15/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: then what should I have put down?
8/15/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: What you can say then, is something like: due to the restriction of |vxy| <=m, there are no other possible cases
8/15/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I've writting down that these are the only cases due to |vxy| <=m, right above where my cases start
8/15/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: isn't that the same thing?
8/15/17, 15:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: in that case its fine
8/15/17, 15:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but i would suggest putting it after all your cases not before them :D
8/15/17, 15:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: it makes the finishing argument seem more full instead of being split in the middle by cases
8/15/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I see
8/15/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but for the rest it would be a decent proof right?
8/15/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: at least, good enough to score full points
8/15/17, 15:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i hope so
8/15/17, 15:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i do some of them like you others i don't only list all cases but i explain why it wont work( for example only a's making a difference in the number of a's and b's in the string )
8/15/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I'm just gonna write them all out like this, just to be sure and safe
8/15/17, 15:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: makes it more believable since all this subject is about is proving shit that is wrong in the first place or proving shit that is already right and known by everyone or branching bisimulation which is basicly "how to waste 10 min of your life in a fun sudoky thingy "
8/15/17, 15:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so anyone who get exercise 1 ?

8/15/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Using aa for both ends the same
8/15/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: If you do it for WW^R you get a^m b^m b^m a^m. Then for at least one of the possiblities, e.g. a^m b^l b^m a^m, it dóes hold that it can resolve ww for some w in {a,b}^*. You can rewrite it to a^m b^(l+m) a^m. As long as l is even, that makes for a valid ww
8/15/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: *As long as l+m is even, [..
8/15/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: but
8/15/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: they picked their word
8/15/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: True, but if you take the string a^m b^m b^m a^m then WW^R becomes a^m b^m a^m b^m, and for that you can prove its not context free? I feel like i dont understand the whole WW^R thing
8/15/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: but you can also pick WW^R as a^m a^m
8/15/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: considering W can be any combination of a's and b's
8/15/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: you don't need a b
8/15/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31643470096  take a look at this please
8/15/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: W^R means the inverse of W
8/15/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But those strings don't match, ^R means reverse, so if you pick w to be a^m b^m then w^R is b^m a^m
8/15/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: a^m a^m can be written such that pumping it up will be in the language im pretty sure
8/15/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Ok ty ruben
8/15/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: But it needs to hold for any w, if you can just find one for which it doesn't work, then it's not a CFL
8/15/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Think i get the reverse thing better now
8/15/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Okay guys
8/15/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Its like this
8/15/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You need to find at least one string for which pumping is totally impossible
8/15/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So where not even one combination for vy can be pumped
8/15/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And thats just impossible for ww^R
8/15/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Cuz whatever your word, you can always make thr combination where vy partly covers w and w^R in such a way that you can pump it

8/15/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Howevrr, you need to.formally prove this  and i have no clue how
8/15/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Yeah if you need to prove it is context free, gg
8/15/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Yeah that's not what the pumping lemma is for though
8/15/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: You could try making a context-free grammar that accepts the language
8/15/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: <Media omitted>
8/15/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Why does it say m-k and m-l for the case that vy consists of a's and b's at k=0? Why not m+k m+l, its being pumped right?
8/15/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Also, do you have to pick a k? Since you can just explain it will be wrong if you pump? No matter how much you pump ?
8/15/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No its not pumped up
8/15/17, 19:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Normal case is k = 1
8/15/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So you pump it down by saying k = 0
8/15/17, 19:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sorry guys phone is being slow AF
8/15/17, 20:46 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: oh ofc.. thx
8/15/17, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: but is there any reason they take k=0? k=2 works too right? and do you even have to pick a k?
8/15/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: btw in exemplerary exam vink only did the cases in which theres only a's or only b's even though theres also the case that vy consists of a's and b's
8/15/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, he forgot to write down the case for both a's and b's, that is a needed case
8/15/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: you can pick any k you want, as long as it fits with k>=0 without 1
8/15/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: because pumping it 0 times can be done, but pumping it once is not allowed
8/15/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: they give you the same answer, so it doesn't matter which you pick, as long as you write it down correctly
8/15/17, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: E
the context free language L_1 {a^mb^m|m>=0} and L_2 regular consisting of an even amount of a's and an even amount of b's
8/15/17, 21:53 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: in the exercise 3.20 i just send, why did they change from i=2 to i=0 and not just use i=2 for both cases to prove its not in the language?
8/15/17, 21:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: since i=0 gives easier notation in the case vxy has multiple symbols
8/15/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you can use i=0 or i=2 or whatever i you want
8/15/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but 0 and 2 are easiest to write down
8/15/17, 22:00 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: but cant use k=2 for both cases?
8/15/17, 22:00 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: in thought that was easiest
8/15/17, 22:00 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: *I
8/15/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: ive been taught that i=0 is easier because you can write it simpler
8/15/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: kinda tricky to explain
8/15/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but please just use k=2 if you egt to the correct solution
8/15/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: or i
8/15/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: idgaf
8/15/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: about the 3rd assignments, when you have an LTS with states that have multiple τ transitions following each other, how many can you take in one go?
8/15/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Until one reaches a different color
8/15/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so I can take as many τ states as I want?
8/15/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ☝🏻
8/15/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes

8/15/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That someone else would be me lol
8/15/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I made that
8/15/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: xD

8/16/17, 07:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is color 4 and goes (T/4) and then T/3 (different color!)
8/16/17, 07:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should stop there
8/16/17, 07:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31643470096 is that correct?
8/16/17, 08:13 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Yes, it is correct
8/16/17, 08:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ik niet snappen wa  jij bedoelen
8/16/17, 08:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jort was er al 😋
8/16/17, 08:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nee van die tau transities wat jij me uitlegde
8/16/17, 08:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Dat zodra hij naar een andere kleur gaat je geen nieuwe transities meer moet pakken
8/16/17, 08:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ja klopt, maar je moet nog wel het verschil tussen links en rechts pakken
8/16/17, 08:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Die afbeelding klopte
8/16/17, 08:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ooh ja dat klopt
8/16/17, 08:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maar deze zin klopte dus niet
8/16/17, 08:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Want hij laat ze zelf al (correct) naar een andere kleur gaan
8/16/17, 08:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ja i guesd
8/16/17, 08:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Die afbeelding klopt iig

8/16/17, 10:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: oh yeah that is better

8/16/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Correct, it says so in the third line.

8/16/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: I'm not sure that's the IH, but it is an assumption we're making.
8/16/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and what does it mean exactly?
8/16/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: X is an element of Gen_i+1, but not of Gen_i?
8/16/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: I think it's just the left-hand side of the implication.
8/16/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Correct.
8/16/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so it's basically saying it is Gen_1?
8/16/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: No, it's saying that X is basically added in this iteration of Gen.
8/16/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Like, it wasn't there when we had "i" iterations, but it was added when we got to "i+1" iterations.

8/16/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: with the 1tb onedrive storage
8/16/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The TU/e is starting a pilot with it
8/16/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It will be implemented pretty soon
8/16/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The first testing session takes place on the 28th of august
8/16/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For the people interested in the USE line Information Science Technology and Society I just got an answer from Roel Bloo. I send a complaint and he went on a mission to find some answers for me. And he has returned from the battle grounds that we like to call TU Administration.

8/16/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For the non-dutch readers, it comes down to this. There is a queue. And like no chance that we can follow the USE-line anymore. We can send an official complaint about it because an employee fucked up one of the fields where it should've said that there is a max of 100 people that can follow this course. But that probably won't do anything and those who still would've liked to do this USE-line are just fucked and you can go suck a dick.

8/16/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah that was a big bummer last year while a lot of other schools have this for years now
8/16/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For Office 365 with 5 license codes (so 5x 1TB onedrive as well, and 5 PC/s and tablets per license), you pay 60 euros/year
8/16/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So for 12 euro/year/p.p. you get it all
8/16/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: before when do we have to register for our courses?
8/16/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 44420671‬: this saturday
8/16/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight

8/16/17, 18:42 - ‪+30 697 453 5573‬: For the studielink enrollment, it should be done before the 1st of September

8/16/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This exactly
8/16/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Does the helpdesk of the tu has a mail adress where i can send my problems with enrollments of mine courses?
8/16/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Depends I think
8/16/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Studycouncelor might be a better idea
8/16/17, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What problems do you have?
8/16/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 2 of the 3 courses i planned arent in osiris for me
8/16/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Emailed bloo about this and he says that they should be there so that if i cant find them i have to come to him or the helpdesk but im going to a festival tomorrow
8/16/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Emailing never does harm anyway. If ur not knocking at the right door they will point you in the right direction
8/16/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Thnx for the reaction but rubain already helped me and now ive found mine courses🙃
8/16/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait what. That wasn't on my resit? :P
8/16/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I did this
8/16/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But im not sure
8/16/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I was very much in doubt
8/16/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maybe there was a regular combination reaching that same point as well?
8/16/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fuck I hope that is not the case
8/16/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How many bisimilar couples did you end up with Stef!
8/16/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ?*
8/16/17, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I had 2 couples
8/16/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah i had 3
8/16/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But that depends whether what i and mart did was right or not
8/16/17, 22:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Cuz i was in doubt
8/16/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: I didn't do that but still got 3😂
8/16/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: An when not doing that, 2 pairs is the right answee
8/16/17, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Can confirm what stef says
8/16/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nice kas
8/16/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not sure how u did that
8/16/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: 🤷🏻‍♂
8/16/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: Well rip me than😂
8/16/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I also got 3 I think
8/16/17, 22:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And didn't do that
8/16/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which
8/16/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do you rememver
8/16/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Remember*
8/16/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: No
8/16/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I have it on my klad sheet
8/16/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But that's in Eindhoven atm
8/16/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And I'm not
8/16/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: I only know that I had 2 dead states wich was a pair
8/16/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: I think I had 
00&01
10&13
03&11
Not sure though
8/16/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: No nm idk anymore 😂
8/16/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: These 3 make sense right🙌🏻
12&10
04&00
03&11
8/16/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahah whoops
8/16/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The dead state pair I had as well
8/16/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And one more
8/16/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Something like this yes
8/16/17, 22:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Those had two matching transitions and one of them had a not counting tau transition
8/16/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: Both the c transactions became not counting tau transactions everything else counted 
Is what is had🤷🏻‍♂
8/16/17, 23:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
8/16/17, 23:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 03 and 11 because they are deadstates and never change color
8/16/17, 23:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 10 and 12 because they can both reach 11 and 13
8/16/17, 23:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And 00 and 04 because the table showed it i forgot the idea behond that pair
8/16/17, 23:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 02 and 14 are not included in the consideration of ex 3b because it asks for reachable states and 14 and 02 are not reachable
8/16/17, 23:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: The termination occured at 5 colors
8/16/17, 23:03 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: True
8/16/17, 23:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also doing a! Tao a? Is not correct btw
8/16/17, 23:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: There is actualy a super easy waiy to make 3a
8/16/17, 23:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its very short and fault proof to do
8/16/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Why not
8/16/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I mean i wasnt sure
8/16/17, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But wonderinf why
8/16/17, 23:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Looking at the two lts we see the a? in P and a! in Q

 Look at which state a? and a! start---a? starts in p0 and a! starts at q1 

Look at where they end.
a? ends at p1 and a! ends at q2

Then the new lts will have a transition from 01 to 12. ( i hope you get it its hard to explain when i am retarded) .
You do the same for b and thats all the transitions you can make for a and b
8/16/17, 23:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: The reason you cant do a? Tao a! Is that it is not a direct chain. ( a! , a? ) =a  means a! followed directly after by a? Can be shortened and replaced with a. Taos break the chain because its no longer ( a! ,a? ) instead it is ( a! , tao , a? ) and thats not a by the relation
8/16/17, 23:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I am pretty sure i am right  because thats how i do evrry single one and i send a few to group and they were correct. They also match with the solutions in book so i guess i am right. I wrote 80 pages of exercises in 2 weeks and i am pretty sure i am not ok in the head now. I hope i helped atleast
8/16/17, 23:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31643470096  did you get me about the tao thing ?
8/16/17, 23:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: If not i can write the whole exercise its not a problem
8/16/17, 23:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok i will just give me 5- 10 min
8/16/17, 23:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I realized i talk to myself 😐
8/16/17, 23:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🦆
8/16/17, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lol
8/16/17, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah i get it but its never really explicitly mentioned afaik
8/16/17, 23:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
8/16/17, 23:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Dont take me for 100% but pretty sure its right
8/16/17, 23:42 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I got the "kill me pls" part right
8/16/17, 23:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Can someone confirm or was this resit a clown fiesta ?
8/16/17, 23:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: With random answers for everyone
8/16/17, 23:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😬
8/16/17, 23:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also curious if i am the only one who uses this methond of finding the combined LTS
8/16/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Dude so messy lol
8/16/17, 23:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hey its not pretty 😐
8/16/17, 23:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But its readable
8/16/17, 23:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And on exam i wrote as if i am writing to the queen of england a royal letter
8/16/17, 23:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😄
8/17/17, 00:09 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: when will we receive the letter with confirmation that we have passed our "propedeutic exam"?
8/17/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Never
8/17/17, 00:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It's like your Hogwarts letter
8/17/17, 00:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hagrid will come by
8/17/17, 00:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And bring it personally
8/17/17, 00:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Your evil uncle will intercept it
8/17/17, 00:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And in the end JFG will deliver it by hand
8/17/17, 00:16 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Hail jan friso
8/17/17, 00:16 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: John F Gennedy?
8/17/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Maybe
8/17/17, 01:19 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: does anybody know how to install the tue's adobe cc package?
8/17/17, 01:19 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: i've got ps cracked but i'd of course like it legit
8/17/17, 07:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You have to be physically at tue to be able to download and install it
8/17/17, 07:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: After that you can use it anywhere
8/17/17, 07:49 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Would the VPN not work?
8/17/17, 08:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nop
8/17/17, 08:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: What ruben said
8/17/17, 08:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Only works when on the tue
8/17/17, 08:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: They probz did that bc otherwise its too easy to also install it on every other pc, while its meabt for ur tue workplace (ur laptop) only
8/17/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: I had the same, but not sure if it is right
8/17/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyone?
8/17/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm starting to worry
8/17/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: @31621372984 i guess its just tue
8/17/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: If u registered in studielink i guess it should be fine

8/17/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: My best guess is that it will change when the first payment is made for coming year
8/17/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: However, still weird that not everyone has it
8/17/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: I have it because I don't have 45 ects yet I thought😄
8/17/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Ooh I can answer this one! Just had contact with STU about this since I messed something up with my payment and I thought that caused it
8/17/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: It's because the faculty administration has not yet passed BSA results to STU, it'll update soon as they do
8/17/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but i already had my BSA previous quartile?
8/17/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or are they gonna do that all at once you think?
8/17/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: I think they're just waiting for all the results to be in and then they will confirm all bsa's to stu
8/17/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: pfff duurt lang
8/17/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice thanks thomas

8/19/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I mailed Bloo about it, but he hasn't responded yet
8/19/17, 15:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: If that means the course is full, then the tue can go duck themselves
8/19/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yep
8/19/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We need to make a statement in person then
8/19/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Until they fix it
8/19/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: According to bloo?
8/19/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: According to me, when they say they are not fixing it

8/19/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Seems that I got lucky and it is full now?
8/19/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Although lucky is relative, because I wanted to do the communications and computing one
8/19/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31624553225  please let me know what Bloo replies
8/19/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Yeah, I'll post it in the chat once he responds

8/19/17, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: This would be real fucked up since I had to wait for a resit result to be able to know for sure I could continue next year so there was no way I could have enrolled earlier
8/19/17, 21:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: could you mention me once you do?

8/20/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: But I assume we will get some sort of message about it all
8/20/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I would hope so, but seeing as how it is still the TU I would not be surprised if they didn't send us any information
8/20/17, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: True
8/20/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: same
8/20/17, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: im already so fkin done with how they just assume we can read their minds

8/26/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I will ask what we are supposed to do
8/26/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: Check the individual course pages on OSIRIS. There are sections called Required/Recommended materials where books will be listed, if applicable.
8/26/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Thanks!

8/26/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There is not a single book that was better for learning the course than actual practice and internet
8/26/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Aside from psychology/technology and maybe USE because the questions were from the actual boom
8/26/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Book*
8/26/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: But still, ebooks

8/28/17, 00:06 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I enrolled for year 2 by submitting the enrollment form to STU, do they send some kind of notification to confirm the enrollment ? 
I asked them but I did not  receive any response yet.

8/28/17, 06:25 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: When you don't have to follow a course because you already have had it, or something that is the same on a different university, but still get the study points for it
8/28/17, 06:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ahh okay thanks

8/28/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: At the pdf store
8/28/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: What kind of PDF do you mean?
8/28/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
8/28/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I am still registered for a subject I deregistered for months ago... should I be worried?
8/28/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes.
8/28/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: hmm
8/28/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Just kidding, it does not matter at all
8/28/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Just send an e-mail "Hey koekwauzen, jullie hebben het grondig verneukt" and then see what happens
8/28/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: good because I wasn't worried
8/28/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I will hahaha
8/28/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But I don't think there are consequences if you just don't show up
8/28/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: why do they fuck up so often...
8/28/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I don't know!
8/28/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But on friday I am getting to complain about it!
8/28/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: nice
8/28/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is our new schedule online yet?

8/28/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is it true that we have nothing next monday?
8/28/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Depends on your subjects :P
8/28/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If you either have the weird USE or social robots: No
8/28/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: rip
8/28/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: how did we connect to the tue vpn again?
8/28/17, 20:52 - Kevin Jilissen: <Media omitted>
8/28/17, 21:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: By.googling this

8/28/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: not so thanks
8/29/17, 01:23 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: does anybody on their TUe laptop have this directory? \Campusmp2\software\adobe\CC\FULL_2017_x64\setup.exe
8/29/17, 01:23 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: i don't have the tue laptop, and i want adobe cc
8/29/17, 01:24 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: The website downloads a shortcut to that directory, but I don't know if it's local, or if it's on a TUe server.
8/29/17, 01:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Kek you think the tue just puts tue install files on every laptop without actually installing them? How would that make sense
8/29/17, 01:30 - Luke Houben: You have to make sure that you are on the tue campus for that unfortunately
8/29/17, 01:30 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: idk, maybe an easy backup for when students decide to uninstall programs and they mess up their laptop?
8/29/17, 01:30 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: rip
8/29/17, 01:30 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Also not true
8/29/17, 01:30 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: can't carry my desktop in my backpack
8/29/17, 01:30 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You have to connect via the vpn
8/29/17, 01:30 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: what
8/29/17, 01:30 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: how then

8/29/17, 01:31 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Make it a .lnk file
8/29/17, 01:31 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: alrighty
8/29/17, 01:31 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: should have thought about that lol
8/29/17, 01:32 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Thats an L not an i btw, i was confused about this myself at first
8/29/17, 01:32 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: unavailable rn

8/29/17, 01:32 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: i guess i'll just keep trying
8/29/17, 01:32 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Restart a few times
8/29/17, 01:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: And if that doesn't work fiddle with the network settings
8/29/17, 01:33 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: pc or shortcut?
8/29/17, 01:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Pc
8/29/17, 01:33 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: aight
8/29/17, 01:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I had to try a few times too before it worked
8/29/17, 01:33 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: hmm
8/29/17, 01:34 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: Weird stuff
8/29/17, 01:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yeah well its mostly wondows fucking up
8/29/17, 01:34 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: With their infinite networking "solutions" which dont work
8/29/17, 01:35 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: Yeah well, the tue could have gotten the extension right as well
8/29/17, 01:35 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: I'm using the windows vpn service btw
8/29/17, 01:35 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: That ok?
8/29/17, 01:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You mean just stabdard wibdows settings
8/29/17, 01:36 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: I mean the windows 10 vpn button in the bottom right corner
8/29/17, 01:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yeah
8/29/17, 01:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: That works
8/29/17, 01:40 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: What a fucking janky ass system
8/29/17, 07:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: For me it only ever worked while on TUe
8/29/17, 09:41 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: If you have to do a course again, do you have to enroll for the course module and test seperate? Since I enrolled for calculus, but the test is not yet in there.
8/29/17, 09:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nop
8/29/17, 09:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You should get a verification email
8/29/17, 09:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Thst you enrolled for the subject
8/29/17, 09:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And in the email they say that ur automatically registered for the tests
8/29/17, 09:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If im not mistaken
8/29/17, 09:49 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Its not in there, I see what you mean for other courses
8/29/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 36162959‬ left
8/29/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah afaik it should be the same when enrolling for calculus again
8/29/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But.maybe someone who  experience can help u out
8/29/17, 09:59 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Thanks anyways
8/29/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: For calculus you must enroll for 2WBB0000
8/29/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is it however correct that 2wbb0000 does not appear in mytimetable yet?
8/29/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You wanna buy my calculus book?
8/29/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't know where to sell it best
8/29/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You can go to the boekenborrel on thursday and sell it to a sjaars
8/29/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is that coming thursday?
8/29/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
8/29/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yep
8/29/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Mine is so un-opened that the front doesn't even have the fold it gets after opening it once or twice
8/29/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks btw
8/29/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, you can also even sell it to studystore
8/29/17, 10:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What's that?
8/29/17, 10:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The place you bought it from 😂
8/29/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lel
8/29/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I picked it up at GEWIS
8/29/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That was all I knew
8/29/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, but GEWIS gets money for doing that, and you get a discount
8/29/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But the order is fulfilled through study store
8/29/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ahh right
8/29/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Same
8/29/17, 11:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: at what time does this start?
8/29/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Books
8/29/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Is there a kickoff meeting for this year?
8/29/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: you need to register for the  subject *2IC02* if you wanna receive updates about second year kickoff meetings
8/29/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
8/29/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Can we still register for that?
8/29/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: I just did
8/29/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Why aren't we automatically registered for that? Since that was the case for the kick off thing of last year
8/29/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: in osiris?
8/29/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: the first quartile of the first year they cant show how fuckup up the administration is so they do everything for you
8/29/17, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: yes in osiris
8/29/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guys I didn't know but appearently you also need to register for a minor with USE
8/29/17, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: At least if you're doing Information Science Technology and Society
8/29/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What do you mean
8/29/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well I emailed the guys from USE and they said this:
8/29/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
8/29/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
8/29/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So when registering in osiris you can also chose a minor
8/29/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You can also register for your coherent packages..
8/29/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Didn't even know we had to do that
8/29/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But.. I enrolled for all three USE courses of the USE line in the planapp
8/29/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So that is not enough?
8/29/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I have no clue lol
8/29/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
8/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I didn't even know we had to register for the minor shit
8/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: As long as I am registered for the courses I expect I'm safe?
8/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: idk why you would have to register for a minor if youre already registered for all the subjects
8/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They can give me the other information whenever they feel like it
8/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: because just the registering doesnt change anything about your education
8/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: unless ofcourse registering for the minor is just a smarter way to register for all courses in a package at once
8/29/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll just do it for USE since the woman asked for it
8/29/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Thing is I want to follow the first two this year and the last one next year
8/29/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So I'm not really planning on registering for the full course yet
8/29/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll email bloo about it tonight
8/29/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He can probably provide some answers
8/29/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: hopefully
8/29/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: kinda vague that we just hear about this now and not even from a source that we shouldve heard it from
8/29/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ruben is more reliable than sources on the TU/e payroll to be honest
8/29/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Have the lecture times changed? Because they all last 15 min longer now
8/29/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And what are the canvas things on my timetable?
8/29/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait what 😂
8/29/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The 45-15-45-15 was perfect for me
8/29/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: It still is
8/29/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But the lecture ends at 30 and then 15 min break
8/29/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But now it ends at 45?
8/29/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Weird..
8/29/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is gonna fuck up my train times
8/29/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just go by motor
8/29/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: your train times will just be the same
8/29/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: maybe the timing will be fucked up
8/29/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The fuel costs money sadly Ruben
8/29/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: On mytimetable it says I have an introductory presentation for engineering design. But the time says all day. And on canvas it says 00:00
8/29/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Everything is fucked again
8/29/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: It never stoped being fuckup up
8/29/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I found it
8/29/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Was the same last year, they take the coffee brakes into account
8/29/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: lol
8/29/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I can remember that the end of the day last year was just untill 30 on my timetable but if the times havent changed then its okay
8/29/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
8/29/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: 16.30
8/29/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: where can I find my new schedule? the calender on canvas is empty
8/29/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: are u on the right date

8/30/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: \\campusmp2\software\adobe\CC\2017\Full\x64\Build\setup.exe  The link refers to a PC on campus in the tue network if you van gain acces to the teu network and mount a network drive youre golden
8/30/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: any ideas?
8/30/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah
8/30/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its cuz ur not on campus

8/30/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but i think i saw the same problem for someone else and he actually managed to fix it without going to tue
8/30/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: in this group
8/30/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not sure who though, also dont remember how he did it cuz i already have it lel
8/30/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: i know but if you use a proper vpn that simulates that you are there you cam mount the drive
8/30/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: ive done this with my home network but i used a difrent vpn
8/30/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ah no clue how that works
8/30/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: just downloaded it on campus, ez way

8/30/17, 11:49 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: it seems you can get on the tue ftp with a regular ftp program, while not being on campus
8/30/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lel
8/30/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Upload porn from an anonymous location
8/30/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: unfortunately, the photoshop files that you download are not .exe but .ink
8/30/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: and the program refuses to do anything with them whatsoever
8/30/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yes the ftp is public and it gives you a shortcut to a file server on campus (Tue network)
8/30/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You can get to the ftp using chrome even
8/30/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lnk*
8/30/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: i always thought that was a capital i
8/30/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nop haha
8/30/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its LNK

8/30/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: bc its short for link
8/30/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: dunno why they didnt just use .link as the diff is only one letter but mkay
8/30/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: one learns something new every day
8/30/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jeah i didnt know all that ftp shit

8/30/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: None until it appears we actually use one
8/30/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I only used the psychology&technology book and used the laptop for all others
8/30/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Saves a lot of money
8/30/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Only used the LST book last year, because I couldn't find it online, but someone could've just gone to the library, taken pictures of the pages and they should've been fine. I agree with Daan. Just wait until you actually really need them instead of ordering them now.
8/30/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LST as well, you're right
8/30/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's the same as pre-ordering games you're not gonna play
8/30/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah
8/30/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: ok
8/30/17, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: If you cannot wait to get to the campus you can also try GIMP, that is freely available
8/30/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: again you don't have to be at the campus to download
8/30/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Explain how it works then lol
8/30/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31629323398  explain please
8/30/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: connect to the vpn
8/30/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and do it that way
8/30/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yes I have tried it
8/30/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: and yes it worked
8/30/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: connect to the vpn and then what?
8/30/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: just do what you would do on the campus
8/30/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ?
8/30/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I've downloaded photoshop at home
8/30/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: With the tue VPN lol
8/30/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: if john can do it...

8/30/17, 18:06 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I've connected to the vpn that came preinstalled but nothing
8/30/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: i can't really do anything about "but nothing"
8/30/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: It gave me a .download file
8/30/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: if you have .download files change them into .lnk files (tha'ts an L not an i)
8/30/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And when I changed it to .Lnk
8/30/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: To says path not available
8/30/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Dude that didnt work for ages
8/30/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Check if the disk is there

8/30/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No clue how john pulled it off

8/30/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Try to understand what the lnk file isbtrying to do
8/30/17, 18:10 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Otherwise you cant fix shit
8/30/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yes but as I said earlier I can't connect to it
8/30/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Tweak some stuff in windows
8/30/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Like network exploration settings
8/30/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: That's the most generic advice but I'll try
8/30/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I kbow but i had the same trouble and without much work got it to work
8/30/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Pre-connecting etc

8/31/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: they have this hip and cool elevator system that hardly ever works
8/31/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: basically you wait 5 minutes for an elevator to show up and then when it does its full
8/31/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: then you start at the wrong floor
8/31/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: if you start at 1 this is a problem, at 0 it is not
8/31/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: the alternative is hypertight stairs
8/31/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: ya its especially a problem going down from 3 or smth
8/31/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: the stairs never prove to be a problem because most lazy shits wait for the elevators :p

9/1/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: My guess is that since the first week wednesday there will be no lecture, they accidently removed all wednesday lectures. The site of Discrete Structures still sais there are contact hours on wednesday.

9/5/17, 13:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Wait... so if i took automata but now i am taking operating systems instead of discrete does that mean i cant do discrete anymore and therefore i have to do the new automata bullshit?
9/5/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Eh i guess
9/5/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Either the two new courses or the two old courses
9/5/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: If you've taken an old course, but cannot take the second old course, you'll have to take both new courses
9/5/17, 13:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thats major bullshit
9/5/17, 13:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So basicly everyone who took operating sys. I stead of discrete is buttfucked now ?

9/5/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: hm? how so?

9/5/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 42456734‬: I would send a mail or go have a talk with Bloo if I were you, I'm sure there's some arrangement that can be made so you don't have to take both new ones

9/6/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, he is asking me to look into my glass sphere, so I just sent what it said

9/6/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: they should be under 2IC00 still
9/6/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz not everyone has access to 2IC02 yet
9/6/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I can't find them in the 2IC00 one
9/6/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not sure if roel already uploaded them tho
9/6/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz u know
9/6/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: in files, they only uploaded the one about the coaching model
9/6/17, 12:57 - Luke Houben: https://canvas.tue.nl/courses/5108/files it's in the 2IC02 course for sure
9/6/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its roel
9/6/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I'll just register for 2IC02 then, since I forgot to do that

9/6/17, 12:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Where can i find the study guide for engineering design ?
9/6/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: guess it should be under files or something?
9/6/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: idk
9/6/17, 13:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah

9/6/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: data structures assignments are not in pairs this time
9/6/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: if I am not mistaken
9/6/17, 13:18 - Luke Houben: Rip
9/6/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Rip indeed
9/6/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: youre not
9/6/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If you look at the rubrics, there is an option that you have to re-do the first assignment. I guess that your revised work has to be handed in saturday
9/6/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good point Johan
9/6/17, 15:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hey guys. In the part where we have to say the nessesary functions of the ROD  how exactly do we do it ?

9/6/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Also the box of the RPC is way too small plus how should we alone decide all of these?
9/6/17, 15:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its about your opinion and also most of it is from the course manual if you read everything up until section 3.2.2
9/6/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: all aboard the bullshit express to banterbury
9/6/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: *plagiarism intensifies 😬*

9/6/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Is there a digital version of the LST book?

9/6/17, 19:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Guys with social robots, is there a "werkcollege" tomorrow?
9/6/17, 19:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yea
9/6/17, 19:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ofcourse why would there not be

9/6/17, 19:27 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: This Spam chat is corrupt. We are oppressed by the Turtle dictator. It is time for a revolutionair! 🇨🇺
9/6/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i agree
9/6/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Only Jort and Luke have that power

9/6/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Does someone know if the job application for the tutor for the Data Analytics for Engineers has to be done in English?
9/6/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Think so
9/6/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Probably noet
9/6/17, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: *not
9/6/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I always use: Does the last name of the person you have to send it to sound Dutch? Dutch
9/6/17, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Otherwise English
9/6/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Hahaha! "Maggy de Wert"
9/6/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Sounds Dutch to me. I'll try in Dutch first then. Because it takes a lot of time to translate it all.
9/6/17, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'd still recommend English, if the recipient prefers dutch he/she will answer in dutch immediately
9/6/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: True... Well I'll just try it.
9/7/17, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Where is the 2WF90 lecture?
9/7/17, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Mytimetable said audi 7
9/7/17, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: But there is a programming lecture there 😂😭
9/7/17, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Shoyld be mf7

9/7/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Did anyone try to apply the Konami code? (a = 1x f, b=2x f)
9/7/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: select and start are missing
9/7/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: left and right too lol
9/7/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 46506857‬: Is there a timelimit for the quizzes for operating systems? Or could you just start now and finish on sunday for example?
9/7/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Start now and finish before the deadline. W/o timelimit
9/7/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Are there more people with the subject "empathy with the user" ?
9/7/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: for the engineering design assignment: how many requirements /preferences/constraints should i come up with?
9/7/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I have about 5 each
9/7/17, 13:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I have 5 for both preferences and constrains and 3 for requirements (but with detailed explanation of each point)
9/7/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: does anyone know what we will be doing at instruction dis tomorrow?
9/7/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: probz go over the recommended exercises like we used to do for LST
9/7/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: since there are no answers available
9/7/17, 16:08 - Luke Houben: How do you know in which group from discrete str. you are? Site says on canvas but the course is not available yet
9/7/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 25301525‬: I think it showed up for me
9/7/17, 16:11 - Luke Houben: I can't see it, in osiris it says group 1 tho but i don't think that has to do anything with the instruction group
9/7/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 25301525‬: Maybe it does, I'm in 4
9/7/17, 16:13 - Luke Houben: Hmmm
9/7/17, 16:13 - Luke Houben: Can anyone else confirm this as well?
9/7/17, 16:15 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: all the groups for discrete structures are on canvas, just go to the course page, click on people and then groups
9/7/17, 16:15 - Luke Houben: But i can't find the course page
9/7/17, 16:16 - Luke Houben: <Media omitted>
9/7/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 25301525‬: Hmm
9/7/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 25301525‬: Strange
9/7/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Try clicking courses and then all courses
9/7/17, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 25301525‬: Maybe give them a mail
9/7/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Press groups on the navigation on the left
9/7/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
9/7/17, 16:17 - Luke Houben: Oh nvm i'm blind, i see it in all courss
9/7/17, 16:17 - Luke Houben: Thnx everyone
9/7/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: what was the website for discrete structures again? I forgot to write it down
9/7/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 25301525‬: Just write 2it50 on google
9/7/17, 16:38 - Luke Houben: http://www.win.tue.nl/~hzantema/ds.html
9/7/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: thanks
9/7/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Is there a way to extend the internal diskspace when you have a TU/e laptop? Did someone do this already?
9/7/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Only by replacing ur current ssd by a bigger hdd/ssd
9/7/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But id call replacing it with a hdd stupid
9/7/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lel
9/7/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I know @31623837581 replaced his ram
9/7/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Extended*
9/7/17, 21:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: U only have one slot in use
9/7/17, 21:22 - Bas Gieling: thats not what he meant
9/7/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And as far as I know there is a m.2 ssd in so you could just pickup a new one and put it in I think
9/7/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: And is this allowed without losing your warranty? Can imagine that the TU can be a bitch about this?
9/7/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You'll lose your warrantly if you open it op I think
9/7/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: See the old reddit for a link to Ifixit
9/7/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Ask if the icy bar will do it for you
9/7/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Jort made an instructable with pictures of the inside that should show some stuff
9/7/17, 21:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If they can notice it afterwards of course, I wouldn't think too highly of those people
9/7/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: You can add a second m.2 ssd
9/7/17, 21:24 - Bas Gieling: theres probably a sticker you need to break in order to open it
9/7/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's what my laptop seller told me but I have not broken anything while opening it
9/7/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well if there a stickers and something breaks inside that is instant no warranty for you ;
9/7/17, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: ;/*
9/7/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So check that.. If there's not breaking sticker then you're fine
9/7/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You can just take your new SSD out and swap it back to the old one if anything happens later in your studies
9/7/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I can always try this... Otherwise I will see if I can open it up (i.e. if there is no sticker) ^^
9/7/17, 21:42 - Luke Houben: I remember there is a second M.2 port to put a second ssd
9/7/17, 21:42 - Luke Houben: And no there is no warranty sticker iirc
9/7/17, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: The TUe ICT people Will do it for you if you want
9/7/17, 21:58 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: have opened it twice, once to extend ram, once to add a second m.2 card. never seen any kind of warranty sticker
9/7/17, 22:05 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: The TUE ict people probably wont notice a thing but if you are unsure about tour ict pc repair skills you can ask them to do it for free without breaking warranties
9/7/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Lol just added new thermal paste to my laptop today, by myself
9/7/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Fuck warrenty
9/7/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: new thermal paste? did they put on too little or what
9/7/17, 22:21 - Luke Houben: Own thermal paste is always better than the default factory patches they put on
9/7/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Why lel
9/7/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Yup they didn't put on much and it drastically lowered my gpu temp by doing it so I'm happy
9/7/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31643470096
9/7/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: It's the Lenovo laptop btw, not the hp
9/7/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sounds fair, not gonna do it tho
9/7/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Im not shy of opening up my pc
9/7/17, 22:25 - Bas Gieling: thats strange tbh, manufacturers usually do anything to lower their laptop temperatures
9/7/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But thats a bit beyond my comfort zone 🙃
9/7/17, 22:26 - Bas Gieling: especially something as easy as thermal paste
9/7/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It can dry out over the years right?
9/7/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Well it's been two years with my laptop
9/7/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or is that only when overheating?
9/7/17, 22:26 - Bas Gieling: yea thats true
9/7/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Not sure
9/7/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Anyway if you're careful then it's perfectly doable, but it's all at your own risk
9/7/17, 22:28 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: I did just go from 97°C to around 60
9/7/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3gDzIGoKubFR2xwZWpya2Vzd0E?usp=sharing
9/7/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: for solutions
9/7/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Please just upload them to cs students...
9/7/17, 22:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: This will create more and more sources again
9/7/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: there's a lot of older students in the DS group
9/7/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: on whatsapp
9/7/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They are not on CS students
9/7/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They can easily register
9/7/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: problem is more whether they want to go through the hassle
9/7/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I would like them to , yes
9/7/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I also want their support with these exercises
9/7/17, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well I think tbh this is way more hassle
9/7/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: for them with only this course it isn't
9/7/17, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I can ask
9/7/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Heb 't ze aangeboden, zie het morgen wel ;)
9/7/17, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: goed dat je me eraan herinnerde
9/7/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Kump vast goed ;D
9/8/17, 07:06 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Did anyone hear anything back from their p-exam?
9/8/17, 07:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not me
9/8/17, 07:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nope
9/8/17, 07:28 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: hmmm another story of tue planning
9/8/17, 07:30 - Luke Houben: For engineering design do we need to be there the whole 4 hours or just the time you are planned in according to the planning?
9/8/17, 07:31 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: i think just the time slot your group has and if you wanna work outside those this also fine
9/8/17, 07:34 - Luke Houben: Ah alright
9/8/17, 07:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I suggest to pick the whole afternoon to make sure your group doesn't lable you as a lazy shit
9/8/17, 07:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I know I would 😏
9/8/17, 07:45 - Luke Houben: But isn't that impossible atm since the room you are booked in is only available to one group at the time?
9/8/17, 07:46 - Luke Houben: And you can't set up a meeting yet becuz you can't reach them?
9/8/17, 07:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: you can book a room and not go
9/8/17, 07:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wait
9/8/17, 07:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good point Luke
9/8/17, 07:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I take it back
9/8/17, 07:48 - Luke Houben: I guess we'll see how it goes then today
9/8/17, 08:18 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Bloo said during the kickoff we would get an invitation around the end of september
9/8/17, 08:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: "Bloo said" is where it becomes dubious
9/8/17, 08:19 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: where can i find "luna 1.056"? i have discrete structures there and I think they dont mean the living tower
9/8/17, 08:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They do
9/8/17, 08:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lower floor has lecture rooms
9/8/17, 08:19 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: ah thanks
9/8/17, 08:19 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: The living tower is multi purpose, also all the culture associations are gonna be in the basements
9/8/17, 08:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Protip: you can't reach the spar from inside Luna, although you can see it
9/8/17, 08:20 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: you walk up the staris and then just follow the signs ill open the door for you
9/8/17, 08:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Other protip: the spar already has pepernoten
9/8/17, 08:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Kruidnoten as well? I prefer those
9/8/17, 08:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hell yes bought a kilogram from jan linders yesterday
9/8/17, 08:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i mean kruidnoten whoops

9/8/17, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: S2e1? Never had the course tho
9/8/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: "be right back" season 2 ep 1
9/8/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: if i recall correctly
9/8/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol how do you know
9/8/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks
9/8/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: googling black mirror robots also gives this result hehe
9/8/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice
9/8/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: I've watched that episode, it has a robot with an ai trained by the messages of a dead guy and so it sorta tries to be social I guess
9/8/17, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Couldn't miss
9/8/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: aren't we watching it
9/8/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: at the uni
9/8/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Are there answers avaible of exercises data structures? From the book
9/8/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I found some online last year, but don't remember where
9/8/17, 19:35 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Just Google the book + the exercise number
9/9/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Hey, does any of you have the answers to the exercises in the logic and set theory book?
9/9/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There's a gdrive
9/9/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Lemme look it up
9/9/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Made by the students from gen 15/16 I believe
9/9/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Nvm, got it
9/9/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Thx though
9/9/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5PqyDzNNBYsc1RiS1dzTk9nT2s
9/9/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh
9/9/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh well
9/9/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Oh nice! Thx!
9/9/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But those are student made though so be carefull it's not certain they are correct
9/9/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: Does anybody know if there are online lectures available for Discrete Structures??
9/9/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: There aren't
9/9/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: No video college?
9/9/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: No, they are big meanies that enjoy our suffering
9/9/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: Has anyone managed to figure out how to make the video stream from your Arduino in engineering design not shit yet?
9/9/17, 18:25 - Kevin Jilissen: What did you expect of a 16MHz microprocessor with 2kb RAM
9/9/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: What do you define as shit?
9/9/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: well by default it is streaming at 160*120 at 6fps, i'd expect something at least slightly better if we're supposed to make a robot with it
9/9/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: and its not even normal uncompressed 160*120 it's a heavily compressed  mjpeg stream
9/9/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Alright yeah that's shit
9/9/17, 18:30 - Kevin Jilissen: Can you see what the BAUD rate of the serial communication is?
9/9/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: What is the native res of the camara?
9/9/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: the camera is a piece of shit as well but according to specs I found it should be able to do 640*480
9/9/17, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: and when you plug it straight into your pc the quality is much better
9/9/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: also this has nothing to do with the baud rate I think, the arduino we get has 2 processors, one is just the normal arduino one and the other runs some version of linux for doing all the network related things
9/9/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: the linux one is where the mjpeg program runs
9/9/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: <Media omitted>
9/9/17, 18:37 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpg-streamer/

it's using this to stream the video
9/9/17, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Are you sure that the camera is not broken? I heard from a friend last year that his was broken and he had to pay for it eventually because he did not mention it in time to hia supervisor
9/9/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: I am sure the camera is fine, i can connect it to my pc and it'll have acceptable quality
9/9/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Ah alright
9/9/17, 22:10 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: we needed to watch an episode of black mirror for USE social robots, i recall it was the 4th episode, but since season 1 only has 3 episodes (as far as i can see), does that mean s02e01?
9/9/17, 22:12 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: isn't that for next week?
9/9/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: its for the final but its a good show ive heard so i dont mind watching it
9/9/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: its a very good show, and the episode is s2e1
9/9/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: i recommend watching it from the beginning though
9/9/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: jij krijgt van mij een coupon voor 1 gratis ijsje uit de vriesla
9/9/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: the episodes are not related right?
9/9/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: I dont think so, no
9/9/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Every episode is different story
9/9/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I encourage every one to watch them all
9/9/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Its a really good show
9/9/17, 23:43 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: It does
9/9/17, 23:43 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Same
9/10/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fucking hell watched s1e1 and s1e2 and idk if I'm gonna watch any more than s2e1 tbh
9/10/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Why
9/10/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk I gotta sit and stare into nothingness for 10 minutes each time I finish an episode
9/10/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Theyre messed up yh
9/10/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Love it

9/11/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah
9/11/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: its in the course manual
9/11/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: 5 per solution
9/11/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Per function
9/11/17, 10:41 - Luke Houben: Oh yeah like that
9/11/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: but what is this about text?
9/11/17, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: It's utter nonsens
9/11/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: 4.2.5 Task until next meeting - Deadline: September 11
Create a "Solution-Encyclopedia": For all the functions defined in 4.2.3 the team members have
to generate typically 10 solution ideas regardless the RPCs or the course task. Forget all limits:
here, you just gather options for the function. The aim here is to be creative and find all kinds of
ideas: the more the better!
Example
Function = Go from point A to point B.
Solution ideas can be : crawl, run, fly, jump, bounce, hover etc.
Attach at least 5 images per function (any kind: sketched, from literature or from the internet)
to show examples and share inspiration to these solutions.
9/11/17, 11:00 - Luke Houben: "These prototypes do not need over-detailing: 3DCAD-models are too much. We challenge you to come up with at least 5 fundamentally different,original function solutions!"

9/12/17, 00:42 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Pick 2, you can switch to 1 whenever you feel like it + most activities are optional
9/12/17, 00:44 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yeah that seems fair, I don't want to really neglect 'spotting my career' altogether, but if it seems useless I can always switch to 1 later

9/12/17, 01:33 - ‪+31 6 21844269‬: Did we have to explicitly ask for re-enrollment for this year? I simply submitted the money and now they are asking me for a  motivation letter as to why I re-enroll so late

9/12/17, 01:37 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: They sent an email saying you had to re enroll in studielink

9/12/17, 01:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: With the other option besides digid
9/12/17, 01:37 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Then they probably have something else for foreign students
9/12/17, 01:38 - ‪+31 6 21844269‬: it appears not :d
9/12/17, 01:39 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Dimitar how did you re enroll for this year?

9/13/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Will installing a 2nd OS on the tue laptop void the warranty?
9/13/17, 13:57 - Bas Gieling: no
9/13/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Thanks
9/13/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: why would that be the case?
9/13/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: the warranty is on ur hardware anyways, so doesnt really matter which software u run as long as u dont overclock anything i suppose
9/13/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Yes, but if you decide to uninstall windows (which you don't need for this study program) and you have any issues the first solution they try will be reinstalling windows and wiping your other os
9/13/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Even if it's windows but not the tue version
9/13/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: even if the problem is not software related
9/13/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: even if u just ask for a new password
9/13/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: btw thats total BS boys, i went there with my own windows and they will try to fix stuff just as well without immediately putting back the TUe windows
9/13/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Would be weird if they will reinstall windows as first try, mostly that option is only used when nothing else seems to work
9/13/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: indeed
9/13/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: why is the line at subway so long

9/13/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: the supply is there
9/13/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: so there is less supply ^^
9/13/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: depends on how supply is being defined in this matter
9/13/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: in terms of materials, supply is at least as high as the demand
9/13/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: tru

9/13/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: dont u hate it when your group members dont respond to your texts about any progress on the arduino
9/13/17, 18:41 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ah shit wrong chat mb
9/13/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sounds like the right chat actually

9/13/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Do we also get student accounts for visiual studios?
9/13/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Visual studio is free...
9/13/17, 19:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or well, the community edition is
9/13/17, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You don't need enterprise or something unless you are really really an enterprise
9/13/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: I know
9/13/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Was just wondering ^^
9/13/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 22540209‬: If you really want to, you can get enterprise with your Gewis account
9/13/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: You can also get the entire jetbrains suit for free if you can't manage to install visual studio correctly like me
9/13/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Jetbrains has a good c++ editor?

9/13/17, 21:59 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Which one do you guys use? I always used vs for c++
9/13/17, 21:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'm using it for C rn
9/13/17, 21:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: works fine I guess
9/13/17, 21:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: don't really have a preference
9/13/17, 22:00 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: as long as it puts a } after I type a { I'm happy
9/13/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jort doesn't set unrealistic standards
9/13/17, 22:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Be like Jort
9/13/17, 22:07 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: one day i'll make my own IDE, all it does is put } after {
9/13/17, 22:07 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it will sel one copy
9/13/17, 22:40 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys hen is the 5th hour?

9/14/17, 10:48 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Yup I got it
9/14/17, 12:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys today we will have only presentations for social rovots right?
9/14/17, 12:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: No lecture?
9/14/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Indeed
9/14/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Last lecture was a slide showing what time each group has to be there
9/14/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I don't remember the details.of it though
9/14/17, 12:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Do we have to be present for all the presentations or only ours?
9/14/17, 12:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Like if i am in 5th hour do i have to stay for 6 and 7?
9/14/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Only yours i think
9/14/17, 12:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thanks guys
9/14/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: 5th hour
9/14/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: According to the course guide
9/14/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Next week its 7th hour
9/14/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Then two times 6th hour
9/14/17, 12:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh shit rly?
9/14/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Yass
9/14/17, 12:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Does that mean different groups present different days ?
9/14/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: No, two different locations
9/14/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: We're in auditorium 15
9/14/17, 12:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I thought ll groups present today split in 5th 6th and 7th hour
9/14/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Nah, each hour like 4 groups present
9/14/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do we stick with the same group?
9/14/17, 12:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: If you mean do you change your group i think no
9/14/17, 12:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Wait 4 groups per hour?
9/14/17, 12:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How long do those presentations have to be to fill 45 min😐
9/14/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Check the course guide
9/14/17, 12:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok
9/14/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: <Media omitted>
9/14/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 7 minutes Dimitar
9/14/17, 12:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oki
9/14/17, 12:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thanks
9/14/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: It seems unlikely to me that you have to present at all 3 hours since thats 15 * 5= 75 people in a audi classroom
9/14/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no it's 45 minutes per 5 groups
9/14/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 5*7 minutes = 35 minutes so that gives them some time to spare
9/14/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There's always a showoff who presents for like 15 minutes making everyone get home late
9/14/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Sorry I meant be present
9/14/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooh no
9/14/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No you don't have to
9/14/17, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering you are always allowed to leave any lecture when you please
9/14/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: So do we have to be present during the entire social robots thing or not?
9/14/17, 13:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: онлъ фор ъоур пресентатион хоур
9/14/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yes I believe so
9/14/17, 13:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: only for your presentation hour
9/14/17, 13:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: sorry wrong language at first didn't even see
9/14/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Лол
9/14/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't think so, since it does not even fit in the room
9/14/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is kinda awkward presenting something with the spectator being in licking distance
9/14/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But you don't know when its your turn right?
9/14/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: there's a whole schedule
9/14/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: you're just there for one of the hours
9/14/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Oh nice
9/14/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Im group 1
9/14/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: So get it over with and homewards
9/14/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nice
9/14/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You're presenting as well?
9/14/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Idk
9/14/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: We decided everyone
9/14/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Does their own part
9/14/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Is that not how it works?
9/14/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wow dude, 5 people gonna do a 7 minute presentation
9/14/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good luck
9/14/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yep
9/14/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: That means only 1 min something for me
9/14/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: 💪
9/14/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not sure that's a win
9/14/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Like introducing yourself to someone and running to the bus immediately after
9/14/17, 13:16 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ahauahuahuaha
9/14/17, 13:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Daan nailed it
9/14/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Hahaha
9/14/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Can someone share the schedule?
9/14/17, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: <Media omitted>
9/14/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Is there a limit to how many people can present?
9/14/17, 13:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think no
9/14/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Does anyone know what the tue does with removed bicycles? They took away the bikes next to the metaforum :s
9/14/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: sell them
9/14/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Use as resources for engineering design parts
9/14/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Rip
9/14/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: They probably take them somewhere (dont ask me where) and if they arent collected in some time then they give or sell them
9/14/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If you ask security they should know where they keep them
9/14/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I saw some guys riding on a golfcart thingy with a bunch of bikes on the back
9/14/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Hm okay
9/14/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Looked like security
9/14/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: jeah they dont like it when u park ur bike on the "laden en lossen" part
9/14/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: it was intellegent security @31631192870
9/14/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: thought so
9/14/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Don't they have enough parking space? 🙊
9/14/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: true
9/14/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: They do... you have to pay a fine to get it back I believe
9/14/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Oh haha not the question
9/14/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: But you can get the bike back
9/14/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Asked security of tue and they said they placed the bikes near la place building in the fietsenstalling
9/14/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But I'm not feeling like searching for it in the rain so I'll tomorrow then
9/14/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: *I'll see
9/15/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Was there automata resit inspection today?
9/15/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: What does that even mean?
9/15/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: Oh nvm i get it
9/15/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Is it today?
9/15/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Yesterdag 14.30
9/15/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: Shit😓
9/15/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: <Media omitted>
9/15/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: I should have checked the announcements studip🤦🏻‍♂
9/15/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Nice
9/15/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: I only remembered that there was a date on the exam but I could not find anything on the website/canvas
9/15/17, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: How many motors can we connect to the arduino ?
9/15/17, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: For engineering design
9/15/17, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: As many as you can power and buy
9/15/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: More then 4?
9/15/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: Yeah
9/15/17, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: But will be expensive to get enough power for 4 decent motors
9/15/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Our tutor actually told us it's limited, but she didn't say how many..
9/15/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Kwint:
Team FAST is looking for a software expert to join our cause! Are you an enthusiastic Software Science student with some time to spare during the next half year? Apart from an extra on your CV Team FAST offers some serious work experience in a pleasant environment and the opportunity to work on a revolutionary technology.
Your task is to write the code on which our system operates. All our sensors, valves, pumps, converters, etc. need to be read and controlled such that we can: set the temperature constant, keep the pressure high and execute the chemistry on the most efficient level. 
The coding language used is ST, designed specifically for PLC’s. As this language is based on C and Pascal we expect you to have experience in either or both. Apart from this we expect a commitment to the team for at least 8h a week.
9/15/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: sounds nice
9/15/17, 18:54 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Pascal lul
9/15/17, 19:24 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Thomas Stroes.vcf (file attached)
9/15/17, 19:24 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Contact him if interested
9/15/17, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lovely communication, bc i always check Messages of subjects that i Dont have this quartile duh
9/15/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That really is Nice, But keep in mind that for us not passing certain subjects (if you put in too much time in team fast or something) can potentially cause trouble for ur schedule
9/15/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: please put this in the other chat next time, as it is considered spam
9/15/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: While Some subjects dissapear earlier than u like
9/15/17, 20:16 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: I am not saying you should do it, I'm just the messenger. And it looks really good on your resumé so it is definitely not spam.
9/15/17, 20:17 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: People are smart enough in here to consider their own options, not my task
9/15/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I know
9/15/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Just telling em
9/15/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Cuz i know someone who knows how involved you can get
9/15/17, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 😅
9/16/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys, for the Interprocess Communication assignment for Operating Systems, how do we have to split the hash for the multiple workers ?
9/16/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: the idea is that 1 worker bruteforces all the sequences startimg with an a, another worker does it for all sequemces starting with b, etc.
9/16/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Then why does it say "The farmer splits *one* MD5 hash value in *several* jobs, such that all workers can do a job". I don't really understand that one
9/16/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: the farmer gets one hash value. the task of farmer is to find out what the unhashed value is for that hash. He does so by using a brute-force technique, where he simply tries all possible values. The brute forcing can be split up in several tasks however for his workers (so one worker brute-forces all letter 'a' hashes, another the 'b' ones, etc.). The splitting up refers to giving each worker a different letter from my understanding

9/16/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: I think the arduino is not getting recognized on either of my computers
9/16/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Did you specify the type of Arduino and the port under tools?
9/16/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: oh wow
9/16/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: it's just that both the usb cables are broken
9/16/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: with my own cable it gets detected at COM3
9/16/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: cool, it uploads :D
9/16/17, 18:20 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: how is the LedOnLedOff example supposed to work?
9/16/17, 18:21 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: is it an input over Ethernet/wifi?
9/16/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: It's an input using the putty program
9/16/17, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: you mean the Arduino software?
9/16/17, 18:25 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: No, there is a program called putty, it's in the manual I believe
9/16/17, 18:26 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: i'll check it out, thanks
9/16/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: it's in the remotecontrolmanual.pdf chapter 2 or 3 I believe

9/18/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Will remember ruben but there is already someone helping me at the ict center
9/18/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Did you try jamming a regular one in it ? Cuz that's what it looks like lol
9/18/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh nice
9/18/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What's wrong with your laptop ;D
9/18/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: this is why we can't have nice things
9/18/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: Is there a place at tue where you can "pomp op" your bands?
9/18/17, 12:19 - ‪+31 6 19979158‬: yes, behind auditorium at the bike racks
9/18/17, 12:19 - Bas Gieling: your bands

9/18/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Last time i tried this one it was broken
9/18/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: That was 2 weeks ago so maybe they fixed it by now
9/18/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Matrix also has one

9/18/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: holy shit
9/18/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: rip
9/18/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Thats a rip
9/18/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Making all travelling for me hardly possible
9/18/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Impossible. They screwed our reroute over Den Bosch as well
9/18/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Or a bus that is crowded and takes more than an hour longer
9/18/17, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well they say the bus takes 30 minutes more, but forget to include that you need to wait in line for hours before there is any space
9/18/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: We can't even go anywhere. If we wanted we could normally go via Breda Utrecht then eindhoven
9/18/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But even that is not possible
9/18/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Over Den Bosch would do  normally
9/18/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Literally all traffic in tilburg is gone
9/18/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jup :p
9/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Wow that's taking train delays to a whole new level
9/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: For 2 weeks
9/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: These don't even count to the delay counter sadly
9/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: One week for Tilburg Adriano
9/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: When are the examsm
9/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: ?*
9/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sunday 15 till Sunday 22
9/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not then
9/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Knowing the NS, they will probably deploy buses
9/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is a regular week
9/18/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Okay great
9/18/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Takes hours standing in line at rushhour
9/18/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Otherwise I would have written letters to the ns and tue
9/18/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Buses cannot take the massive amount of people that take the train
9/18/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: this was known for a very long time already
9/18/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Well either that or get some other means of transportation
9/18/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yep, nothing else to it sadly
9/18/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: It doesnt matter how long it has been known it still sucks
9/18/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: kek
9/18/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: ya but bd pretends NS told us only today
9/18/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I just wonder why they don't do Den Bosch and Tilburg seperately, so people can still take the detour
9/18/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: but guys we live in capitalism, we should build our own railroad to compete!
9/18/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: True true
9/18/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: could be they're gonna work on the part betwixt the station and the wissels
9/18/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: They are going to work on tilburg station itself
9/18/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: So all traffic there is gone
9/18/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
9/18/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just imagine the chaos
9/18/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And one or two NS people with the sign-sticks "bus here" with thousands of zombie-horde rush hour commuters
9/18/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And massive delays
9/18/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which don't count because they didn't ride anyway

9/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: is it just me or does the camera not fit on the gimbal?
9/18/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: for engineering design
9/18/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's not just you
9/18/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And if you cut of the clip to make it fit it will be sideways lol
9/18/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: well then
9/18/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: handy
9/18/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: anyone know where the search rescue wifi network is?
9/18/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: auditorium
9/18/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And Gemini I think, it's in the remote control manual
9/18/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: you can also just change the wifi network of the arduino with a usb cable
9/18/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Use a good phone hotspot 😏
9/18/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: has anyone already tested the camera?
9/18/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: because the resolution is shit
9/18/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: yes and yes
9/18/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: that's right
9/18/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Actually for us the resolution wasn't that bad
9/18/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I saw the one from another group and that sucked
9/18/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: <Media omitted>
9/18/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh ours was way better
9/18/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait
9/18/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That was connected to the laptop directly
9/18/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The streaming bandwidth just sucks
9/18/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: ohhhh
9/18/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: that makes sense
9/18/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Lul nice focus tho
9/18/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maybe you can alter that yourself?
9/18/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: it doesnt thats the point
9/18/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: you can twist the shiny part of the camera
9/18/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah
9/18/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You need to adjust the focus lol
9/18/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: i heard some people had a robot that couldnt even move and passed the course
9/18/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's not that bad considering how big the thing is
9/18/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: kek
9/18/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: just hand in the HWA's and you are fine
9/18/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: some people had a broken robot and got an 8
9/18/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: typical tue
9/18/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: giving out participation trophies
9/18/17, 15:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: "You're a big failure but you tried really hard right? That's very very good of you, here is an 8 for effort."
9/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 90% of your grade is your report
9/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is actually a good thing considering a lot depends on their shitty network and parts
9/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: read the course goals, building a toy is not in there
9/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And we have more to do
9/18/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This
9/18/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They want to improve your teamwork and such and they need to give you some random goal to try and reach
9/18/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: well its sharper now, thanks nol
9/18/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Remember Windows Phone? That was designed by people who get paid a lot but it worked like shit
9/18/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's about the process of designing something regardless of its functionality
9/19/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: What's the cs website again?
9/19/17, 10:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Cs students
9/19/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Yeah that one
9/19/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Cs-students.nl
9/20/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Do any of you know how to use more than 2 motors for engineering design? What kind of components do you need to power them?
9/20/17, 10:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Kinda depends on the motors
9/20/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: What do you need to know about the motors?
9/20/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: We are 6 motors, but this is 2*3 wired in parallel
9/20/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: *we are using
9/20/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well a stepper would require a driver, a brushed motor can just be controlled via PWM, for a brushless motor a ESC would be advised. Powering them I would do with a bit buck converter and a battery power source ;D
9/20/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: How do you know all this
9/20/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: ^^
9/20/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ehh general interest I guess
9/20/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh and if you start driving like a fuckton of servos you should get a driver for them as well
9/20/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: What is an ESC?
9/20/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You don't need this if you aren't powering them from the arduino
9/20/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Just get the power from your battery pack
9/20/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Unless you are doing something flying, you won't need brushless motors, but an ESC is an electronic speed controller
9/20/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Electronic speed controller
9/20/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well you can make a damn fast car with it as well
9/20/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Guy in my group has an rc car with brushless motor that can go 120 mph ;D
9/20/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Image driving something like that around in the disaster area
9/20/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: imagine*
9/20/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Sounds hella fun
9/20/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: How can I láser cut at uni
9/20/17, 11:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Uuuh i think you can do that in the lab behind the flux building but i dont think they would let backeloyrs do that
9/20/17, 11:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Bachelours
9/20/17, 11:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its mostly for phd people
9/20/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Look in the course guide
9/20/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Hee guys, someone (Abdoullah) in the first year chat is asking if someone knows   R.M.J. Van Leeuwen because he’s is his mentor. Can you sent me a text so I can put you guys in touch?
9/20/17, 11:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: *R.M.J van Leeuwen *
9/20/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: @31683323849 I think that's you?
9/20/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yeah he sent me a message already, but thx anyway Maas
9/20/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: yep, I've had contact with him just now
9/20/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: thanks anyways maas and job
9/20/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Alrighty ^^
9/20/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: we wanted to use 4 and our tutor hinted that 4 was kinda too much
9/20/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: dont know if it still coutns if theyre in parallel tho
9/20/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If you only need data it's easy lol that's just 4 pins to the arduino should work more than fine
9/20/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: Wait are you guys saying you can't control 4 motors separately?
9/20/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: I need to be able to control at least 3 motors separately with the Arduino
9/20/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: Two servos and one for driving
9/20/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: That's possible right?
9/20/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yes
9/20/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes
9/20/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You have the red pcb thingy that has 4 outputs that can be used as 2 h-bridges then you can move back and forth
9/20/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And the servos can be connected to the arduino directly
9/20/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You can look at the schematic on the remote manual for connecting multiple motors and servos
9/20/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: you can buy more of the reb pcd's for €3 ish
9/20/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: cool, thanks!
9/20/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: What does it mean that the current of the power amp is limited to 300mA? Does that mean I can run 5V 300mA on each of the 4 OUT pins or 300mA in total?
9/20/17, 17:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I belive on each. Having 300 total seems like shit
9/20/17, 17:47 - Bas Gieling: this is for the "5V out" connection on the amp, which means that single connector can only handle up to 300mA, the amp can handle 2A per motor on the normal outputs, and 25W total dissipation
9/20/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Gotcha, and those normal outputs also run on 5v?
9/20/17, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: this, can someone help? I could find anything about it
9/20/17, 17:51 - Bas Gieling: it doesnt say anywhere, but id suppose it is 5V yea
9/20/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
9/20/17, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: or do they mean something else
9/21/17, 00:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Dude what subject is that even
9/21/17, 06:46 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: ah, algebra for security
9/21/17, 06:46 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: I have the same question as leon
9/21/17, 07:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys today we have os in the morning but we dont have social robots  is that correct ?
9/21/17, 07:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Because my timetabke says we dont have social robots today same with the course guide for the subject
9/21/17, 07:37 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: yes, no social robots for today
9/21/17, 07:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh niice
9/21/17, 07:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Only team meeting
9/21/17, 07:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Bu we stll have os right
9/21/17, 07:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yea dimi take some responsibility jeez
9/21/17, 07:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Well i do thats why i ask
9/21/17, 07:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Otherwise since my timetabke suddenly doesnt show anything today i could easily go to bed
9/21/17, 07:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But i am responsible
9/21/17, 07:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 💩
9/21/17, 07:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: proud
9/21/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
9/21/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Buy a battery
9/21/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: our things did perfectly fine on 6V btw, but it may depend on the hardware :p
9/21/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: ah ok
9/21/17, 14:06 - Bas Gieling: you could buy more amps i suppose
9/21/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: and how should you connect a battery pack to the amplifier?
9/21/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I suck a lot of dick at this stuff
9/21/17, 14:09 - Bas Gieling: i believe there are 9-12V power IN connectors
9/21/17, 14:10 - Bas Gieling: theres an example in the manual, you should just check that :p
9/21/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: but you weren't allowed to power the amplifier from the arduino right?
9/21/17, 14:12 - Bas Gieling: no, you should indeed power it using a battery pack
9/21/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: cause i have no clue how this works
9/21/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
9/21/17, 14:13 - Bas Gieling: whats unclear?
9/21/17, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: what connector to use from the powerbank to the amplifier? cause there is not micro usb connector on the amplifier
9/21/17, 14:14 - Bas Gieling: not the powerbank
9/21/17, 14:14 - Bas Gieling: a battery pack
9/21/17, 14:14 - Bas Gieling: which you have to buy yourself
9/21/17, 14:14 - Luke Houben: Or make*
9/21/17, 14:14 - Bas Gieling: the powerbank is only for the arduino
9/21/17, 14:14 - Bas Gieling: or make yea :p
9/21/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: How many amps would 5 servos and 4 motors require?
9/21/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: why do they expect us to know how to do this...
9/21/17, 14:15 - Bas Gieling: and to connect the batterypack to the amp youll have to use wires
9/21/17, 14:15 - Bas Gieling: you can find out how to do it
9/21/17, 14:15 - Bas Gieling: depends what kind of servos and motors :p
9/21/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: where can you buy the battery packs?
9/21/17, 14:16 - Bas Gieling: somewhere online probably
9/21/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: are they at the lucid shop or/
9/21/17, 14:16 - Bas Gieling: oh yeah maybe
9/21/17, 14:16 - Bas Gieling: idk
9/21/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: The basic ones, SG90 servos
9/21/17, 14:16 - Bas Gieling: theres a lot of electronics shops in the netherlands
9/21/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: alltrons has a pretty damn cheap kit for batteries, they've got a lot of stuff especially for this course
9/21/17, 14:18 - Bas Gieling: look up how many amps they draw, the amp can handle 300mA on the 5V output and 2A per motor on the normal output, with a total maximum dissipation of 25W, so just calculate whether the one amp is enough or what you need extra
9/21/17, 14:18 - Bas Gieling: by amps i meant ampere
9/21/17, 14:20 - Bas Gieling: i spent 2 hours yesterday afternoon finding this stuff out, so im sure you should be able too, reading the manual and using google :p
9/21/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: did you guys just the the battery pack kit from alltrons?
9/21/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: cause that's more than 1/4 of the entire budget
9/21/17, 14:20 - Luke Houben: Just get a battery holder
9/21/17, 14:21 - Luke Houben: A plastic thingy where you can put in AA batteries
9/21/17, 14:21 - Bas Gieling: you still need AA batteries then tho
9/21/17, 14:21 - Luke Houben: But that is less than 1/4 of the budget
9/21/17, 14:21 - Bas Gieling: true
9/21/17, 14:21 - Luke Houben: Way less
9/21/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: do you need the voltage regulator?
9/21/17, 14:24 - Bas Gieling: the what?
9/21/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
9/21/17, 14:26 - Bas Gieling: dunno
9/21/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Don't buy anything from alltrons
9/21/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They're expensive af
9/21/17, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Then where do you suggest we buy?
9/21/17, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just google electronic stores in Eindhoven you can find plenty ;)
9/21/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: ok :)
9/21/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: A good physical one is brigatti electronics
9/21/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Anyone else found that you can't connect your phone to the camera feed of the Arduino?
9/21/17, 15:50 - Luke Houben: Haven't tried it yet
9/21/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Got it
9/21/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You have to turn off your own dataplan
9/21/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: It prioritises it over the wifi
9/21/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: does anyone know if you absolutely have to use the putty program for controlling your arduino or are you allowed to write your own software to communicate with the yun?
9/21/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: you are totaly alowed to use your own program
9/21/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Afaik it doesnt matter
9/21/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: putty is just a tool they offer, and you are free to deviate from this
9/21/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: As long as u use their WiFi
9/21/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: aight thanks then I didnt just waste 2 hours
9/21/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hahah Nice
9/21/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: What did you do/make?
9/21/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: currently I have a simple "game" made in the unity engine that acts as a tcp client to my yun which can turn on and off the led using an xbox controller while also displaying the video feed using some built in function of unity that lets you capture a website to a texture.
9/21/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wauw
9/21/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That sounds like so much work
9/21/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But have to admit its kinda cool
9/21/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: wow, I use keysticks
9/21/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: it also allows me to send more complicated messages than just a single letter. so I can send full analog stick information
9/21/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ah sick
9/21/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 17783579‬: and the amount of work really isn't that bad, unity does most of the work for me
9/21/17, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Wow that would be very useful when like driving
9/21/17, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Kitty>putty
9/22/17, 07:45 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Were is Luna?
9/22/17, 07:45 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Where*
9/22/17, 07:46 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Behind mf
9/22/17, 07:46 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Tall building
9/22/17, 07:46 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh okay thanks
9/22/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: don't the 18650 batteries from alltrons seem a bit scetchy to some of you? as the 18650 battery standard only allow up to 3500mAh and the site states they have 5000mAh
9/22/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: I mean. if you get those type of batteries fake from china they tend to explode. do the uni know what they are advertising?
9/22/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Get these
9/22/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: https://www.banggood.com/2PCS-Sanyo-3_7V-2600MAH-UR18650ZY-18650-Rechargeable-Battery-p-914803.html?rmmds=search
9/22/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Been using them for months now for multiple purposes
9/22/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: but shouldn't we mail them?
9/22/17, 12:28 - Luke Houben: The design fair is outside of meta right?
9/22/17, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: It was last year
9/22/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I thin Leo yeah
9/22/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Think so *
9/22/17, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Yes, the markthal
9/22/17, 13:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guys i have news. Paul de Bra retired today 😢
9/22/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: noooo
9/22/17, 13:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: He officialy retired after 3 years of intending to do it
9/22/17, 13:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: He is currently finishing his projects and is not taking new stuff
9/22/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: That guy isnt that old right?
9/22/17, 13:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: He also retured from being the rector of the graduate program
9/22/17, 13:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: No he is not
9/22/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Nice, good for him he can retire that early
9/22/17, 13:47 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But he was planning to reture for 3 years now and always delayed it because of unfinished bussines
9/22/17, 13:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Retire*
9/22/17, 13:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: He is now going to be full time researcher i think
9/22/17, 13:48 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Fun stuff
9/22/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Do you need a voltage regulator with a battery pack for engineering?
9/22/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: If your power source does not match the voltage of you component then yes
9/22/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: So you can ‘boost’ a 5v power source to 12v for example
9/22/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: it is adviced to get it all right
9/23/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 21844269‬: Regarding the upcoming presentation for Social Robots, do they ask us to hold a presentation about the article, what its about and discuss its various approaches/topics etc. OR do they want us to only briefly touch on the content of the article and focus our attention on the questions the group answered and what type of responses we got and so on?
9/23/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: What we did is like give a summary of our questions so to speak
9/23/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Like discuss that in the presentation
9/23/17, 18:22 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: If you answered all the questions then that should summarize the article well enough
9/24/17, 19:26 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Algebra for security guys
Could you please give me a hint how to we prove that p^3+pq^2+q^3=0 doesn't hold?
9/25/17, 09:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did anyone get a mail for the P-ceremony yet?
They still need to tell which timeslot we're in on Monday 9th of October
9/25/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Do we know for sure that it's 9th of October?
9/25/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That much they told me over email
9/25/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you got it without weird issues (resits are okay) then you should be on 9th of October
9/25/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But there are two groups, early and late afternoon
9/25/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What mail? I got my P without resits but I don't recall getting a mail
9/25/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No I called and mailed them to make sure I got my P in Osiris
9/25/17, 09:06 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I think you could specify what time slot you wanted
9/25/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No you could specify the date I believe
9/25/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: But I also think I read somewhere that will get the mail at the entry of this month
9/25/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: First date is always 9th of October and the phone lady told me they'd send the mail for the hour
9/25/17, 09:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How nicely on time for parents who need to take free hours
9/25/17, 09:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: There is only one date for the p thingy right? 9th of October ?
9/25/17, 09:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not sure haha
9/25/17, 09:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There is also one some months later I believe
9/25/17, 09:09 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: typical tue
9/25/17, 09:09 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: maybe we should just call will alle the students
9/25/17, 09:14 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: they are using "ambtenaren"  hours. we are only reachable by phone from 12:20 till 5 o'clock...
9/25/17, 09:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Tf is that😂😂
9/25/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You didn't actually expect them work on a monday morning right?
9/25/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I mean who still does that
9/25/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: I thought you had to specify a slot when you registered
9/25/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No time slot tho
9/25/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 58856924‬: Oh so just a day then?
9/25/17, 09:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah
9/25/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: The study advisor said we would get an invitation 2 weeks in advance, the timeslots are 12:00, 14:00 and 16:00
9/25/17, 09:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 2 weeks in advance? isnt that about nowv
9/25/17, 09:28 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
9/25/17, 09:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That is exactly now
9/25/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks tue
9/25/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Why in the afternoon tho when a lot of people just have college?
9/25/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Because the same would be true for the morning, so the only real other option would be doing it in the evening
9/25/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: And that would make it harder for parents etc to come
9/25/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No it would help
9/25/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Because then parents don't have work anymore
9/25/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Well, most of them
9/25/17, 09:33 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I guess it depends on how close your parents live
9/25/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: If the ceremony would start at 18.00 for example my parents would still have to take the afternoon (or part of it) off
9/25/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: That is until one minute before tomorrow if i can trust the punctuality of the tue
9/25/17, 09:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yea tru
9/25/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So nice to see we avoid difficult homework because it is stressful but apparently when you have a degree you can just wait with trivial tasks until the deadline
9/25/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: For the algebra for security guys, how do we prove that x^3 + x + 1 is irreducible in Q[x] with stuff from the reader?
9/25/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well the factor is <= 3 so you only have to find that is has no zero's which can either be done by calculating the differential or by calculating the possible rational roots and seeing if any of those yield zero. If it has no zero's you can conclude it is irreducible and with collorary 2.3.4 you can conclude that it thus is a field
9/25/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If you know how to do b, c and d I'd gladly take some help with that ;D
9/25/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: the struggle is real Ruben lol
9/25/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, calculating the possible rational roots was google's answer too ;) but there is nothing about it in the readed
9/25/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Which is wierd imo
9/25/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The reader is weird anyway tbh, not enough examples and the examples that are in there are vague af and are the most obvious cases
9/25/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: or are the most obvious cases*
9/25/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Is there a discrete structures WhatsApp group?
9/25/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes
9/25/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: yes
9/25/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31642007885  could you share the link
9/25/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Thanks
9/25/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: has anyone received their invitation to the propedeuse ceremony yet?
9/25/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA no
9/25/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yeah this
9/25/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Neuwp
9/25/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31620885116
9/26/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: There's supposed to be a bicycle pump at the Auditorium, but I can't find it, does anyone know where it is?
9/26/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: I did find the little bicycle repair stand thing
9/26/17, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Bicycle shed at the north side
9/26/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: That's at the car parking side, right?
9/26/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah
9/26/17, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: I've walked back and forth that side three times, but nothing even closely resembled a bicycle pump
9/26/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: maybe it's broken again and they took it away, there's also one at gemini i believe, not sure where though
9/26/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Matrix has one as well
9/26/17, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or GEWIS at meta has one
9/26/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: I'll check those places, thanks

9/27/17, 00:07 - ‪+31 6 22368996‬ left
9/27/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I am hereby collecting formal complaints for the kringgesprek tomorrow
9/27/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The P ceremony information and crammed up DS interim are my first ideas
9/27/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Incomplete schedules and broken systems
9/27/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: +1 for p ceremony information
9/27/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: absence of information about subjects automata and discrete structures changing completely
9/27/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thus thus fucking everyone over
9/27/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Osiris planapp still?
9/27/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why nit
9/27/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm getting free lunch so got all the time I need
9/27/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This a lot, but I will also be there to complain about it myself :P
9/27/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I will complain about Rick's complaint as well
9/27/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait.. that doesn't work
9/27/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Be sure to start everything you say with "LUUUUUUUUUUUUK, IK HEB EEN KLACHT"
9/27/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: He likes that
9/27/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Who is Luuk
9/27/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In this case
9/27/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The CO
9/27/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Patricia is no more
9/27/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Rick you going to the kringgesprek as well?
9/27/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Patricia :o
9/27/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yep, although I want to watch GEMOLD
9/27/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nice
9/27/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We gaan ze mollen Rick
9/27/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: This
9/27/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I am so sick of them not even being able to fix my schedule
9/27/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And not communicating for that matter
9/27/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: With basically everything
9/27/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: The fact that DS lecture is basically writing down a book on a blackboard is kinda weird too
9/27/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I think his lectures are actually quite good, but I might be alone in this one lol
9/27/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I learned more from Stef screaming random noises while trying to explain me something in 4 hours than I did from the paid teacher
9/27/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Kinda sad
9/27/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Well if you wouldn't read the reader yourself the lectures are useful :p
9/27/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: (this was an actual reason for me to go to them)
9/27/17, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Even if he literally copies the lecture notes onto the blackboard he still makes mistakes
9/27/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is another proof for the fact that having a degree makes you easy money
9/27/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Skills are not valued
9/27/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Same
9/27/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just the degree
9/27/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: The only thing that's not in the reader is blaming the tu for everything like the beamer still being turned on and the connection not working
9/27/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
9/27/17, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He has time to fix that if he would say "read this bit of text that I am going to write on the board criss-cross otherwise
9/27/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: While he can turn of the beamer from the desk IIRC
9/27/17, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: off*
9/27/17, 18:19 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Exactly XD
9/27/17, 18:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The beamer can be turned off from the desk, but is the fossile capable to do so?
9/27/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: This is so fucking annoying
9/27/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Dude They are not slaves, ur teaching at a technical university, fix it urself ffs
9/27/17, 19:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nop
9/27/17, 22:40 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: "guys, the microphone is turned off, so you will just have to be quiet"
9/28/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Logic 2.0
9/28/17, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Can you elaborate this with details in a PM please?
9/28/17, 12:30 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Does anyone know if you can connect 2 motor shields to arduino?
9/28/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Yes you can, there's a library that allows a servo port to act like a motor port
9/28/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: That's what I recall from last year
9/28/17, 12:42 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Thanks
9/28/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: We still haven't gotten an email or something about the p-exam right?
9/28/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: don't know about the rest, but I haven't seen anything of it yet, and osiris says nothing either
9/28/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but the tuiton payment had some issues for some people(including me), so there was probably some technical malfunciton
9/28/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I got two emails about that today yeah
9/28/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: Yes. There was a technical malfunction. The transaction will be done tomorrow.
9/28/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just now at the kringgesprek Roel said he doesn't know when we'll get that
9/28/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: wauw
9/28/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The administration is apparently "working very hard" to figure out at what time we need to be there 9th of October
9/28/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: why the fuck doesnt he know
9/28/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He expects an answer one of these days
9/28/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: when basically all other universities have already handed out the P diplomas
9/28/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Probably in 1 or 2 days he said
9/28/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but it is certainly going to be the 9th of october?
9/28/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Yes
9/28/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: aight
9/28/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: how many people may you invite?
9/28/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I recall a mail saying "bring family and/or friends"
9/28/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It didn't state a limit
9/28/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i dont really recall many mails about this subject
9/28/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: since there havent been many
9/28/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm I did call the administration once, maybe she told me
9/28/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: aight
9/28/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i suppose it will be in the evening tho right?
9/28/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: the slots are 14.00 and 16.00 i think
9/28/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: youve gotta be kiddin me
9/28/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: It was in one of the powerpoints
9/28/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I'll try and find the slides
9/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
9/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: these are like the most useless slides ever
9/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No Roel said there isbone group at 14:00
9/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And one at 16:00
9/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wait sorry ilse
9/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's what you said
9/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: how am i supposed to invite family at that time
9/28/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: like i know roel doesnt do much on a regular day
9/28/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but my mom and dad both have a job that requires them to be there during the day
9/28/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: <Media omitted>
9/28/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: true

9/28/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Stef don’t curse please
9/28/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: gast ik word zo kanker moe van heel die roel

9/28/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: where did you find this slide?
9/28/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: is it in the 2nd year canvas group?
9/28/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: eh

9/28/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: does this work?
9/28/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yea
9/28/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: in there

9/28/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: <Media omitted>
9/28/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: you think one of these servos will be able to take care of steering the ROD's wheels
9/28/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: ?
9/28/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: they're the ones that are in the camera gimbal
9/28/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: it says they provide 1.8kg torque
9/28/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Highly depends on the weight you put on those wheels I'd say?
9/28/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: yeah
9/28/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: i'll just get a big boy servo then
9/28/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: pro tip get a continuous one if you want ti ride further than 5cm
9/28/17, 17:53 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What do youean by that
9/28/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 22540209‬: Some servos can only turn 180°
9/28/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: e.g. the blue one in the pic
9/28/17, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Jeah those are good for steering or something But Rip if you intended to use em for driving
9/28/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Is turning with two wheels by changing the speed easy
9/28/17, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: yes, kinda
9/28/17, 19:38 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: Lol yeah wasn't planning on driving with a servo
9/28/17, 19:38 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: Only turning
9/29/17, 09:50 - ‪+31 6 13345037‬ joined using this group's invite link
9/29/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: anyone received the p - ceremony invitation yet?
9/29/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: not that im aware of
9/29/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lemme check
9/29/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nope
9/29/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You can mod those to turn completely tho, which is what we are planning to do
9/29/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: https://www.fetchmodus.org/projects/servo/
9/29/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: or buy the continuous ones for the same price on conrad...
9/29/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻
9/29/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 30686090‬: Could someone help me maybe? I know some of you have MAC laptops. How did you send commands to YUN using Terminal? I managed to connect to it, but when I send 1 or 0 (led on off example they provide) it says this command doesn't exist. I think I should probably put some other command before it to make it work, but can't figure out which or find anything
9/29/17, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: well, you should not send it to your standard shell
9/29/17, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You should connect to your serial port first, this can be done using the serial monitor(magnifying glass with dots) in the arduino IDE
9/29/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 30686090‬: So you should send these commands not through terminal but using serial monitor in IDE?
9/29/17, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yep
9/29/17, 12:41 - Luke Houben: You can use terminal tho
9/29/17, 12:41 - Luke Houben: Make sure your bridge and console are active in your sketch
9/29/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, but not the standard mac terminal
9/29/17, 12:42 - Luke Houben: Then ssh into your arduino
9/29/17, 12:42 - Luke Houben: Well yeah true, but putty works
9/29/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 30686090‬: Thanks
9/29/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: just got the p exam mail
9/29/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: me too
9/29/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Same
9/29/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
9/29/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: but there is a visitor maximum of 2 pers
9/29/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: BS
9/29/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: How nice of them to create a live stream... They'll probably have an operator that is a bit too late with the camera movement every time...
9/29/17, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
9/29/17, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: yeah and osiris is down today so we cant check the "bring as many people as you'd like" statement
9/29/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31648187618  you feel like making a complaint mail so we can spamm those fuckers with it?
9/29/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Does anyone know whether the ceremonies for mathematics and software science are combined?
9/29/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nvm
9/29/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guys Osiris and the kickoff slides said "invite family and friends"
9/29/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not sure how they feel about the size of families
9/29/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Also including friends to the maximum of 2 total
9/29/17, 15:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So who's responsible for this? I got 30 minutes right now
9/29/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Moving to Jessica bergers right now
9/29/17, 15:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hope she is delayed in her office
9/29/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Go Daan!!
9/29/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
9/29/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I just had a very detailed talk with the directeur bachelor college of our faculty and her colleague
9/29/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: and?
9/29/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well, a few important remarks (typing while walking so have patience)
9/29/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: These two ladies have just recently received the conclusive list of nominal graduates, which is why they were delayed a lot by third parties to create the schedule. I asked why they didn't send mails with headsup information but they reacted that previous years they got a lot of complaints for doing that from students who apparently hate receiving emails.
Regarding the number of guests they responded that usually the P ceremony was combined with the Bachelor ceremony and then we weren't even allowed to bring any guests. The 2 guest limit exists because they couldn't get "the big room" for this even though they tried
9/29/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Also, a big problem in amount of guests is students who don't show up don't notify these ladies of that detail
9/29/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I
9/29/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hate
9/29/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: The
9/29/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which is why others can bring less guests to be safe
9/29/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: TUe
9/29/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They even agreed big time in the fact that this should be known weeks earlier at least, but that is a big cog-system in which they are a victim as well
9/29/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: A-fucking-mazing job, tue!
9/29/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Can I bring another student in there? Like not as a guest?
9/29/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We direct our hate towards them but they need to wait for others
9/29/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: These ladies who organised this are not the source of the problem
9/29/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: What a surprise
9/29/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Also, bachelor and master ceremonies have priority, which I understand
9/29/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: One of these ladies writes a personal story for every single master graduate
9/29/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And then some of these don't even show up
9/29/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: *bachelor
9/29/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So she spends about 30-60 minutes per story and they just don't come
9/29/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Imagine her paim
9/29/17, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pain
9/29/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So the formal complaint I came in with was directed at the exact right person accidentally, but she couldn't help it
9/29/17, 15:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So basically we dun goofed
9/29/17, 15:28 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: yeah but 2 people isnt doable, if you bring your parents and you gf / bf
9/29/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: This
9/29/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I told em that exact example
9/29/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I'm just gonna bring 3
9/29/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There is no space simply
9/29/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Only if people that don't come sign off in time (which is right fucking now) they can make exceptions
9/29/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: you dont need an invitation  to get in do you? just walk in in two groups
9/29/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Exactly
9/29/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No one says you can't
9/29/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maybe when walking in you get a 2 passes per graduate with a campuscard
9/29/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: its a public event
9/29/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: if it's a public event does it even matter? you can just have anyone walk in then
9/29/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah we'll manage
9/29/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Anyone else got a second mail about the propedeuse stuff? It has nothing in it though, only "hello" and "goodbye"
9/29/17, 17:09 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah
9/29/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: they just wanted to say hello joost let them
9/29/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Okay, I'll reply with a hello goodbye
9/29/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Hey guys, i disnt get a mail yet for pceremony, but i signed up for them to check for it on the late september date
9/29/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Is that causing it you think?
9/29/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: JIJ HEBT ONVOLDOENDE, DAT IS PROBLEEM!!!
9/29/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you might want to contact them
9/29/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yeah for sure, you won't be eligible for this ceremony
9/29/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: The exam comittiee checked for propedeuse in middle of august
9/29/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: As you signed up later, they will check it later, meaning you won't be a part of the ceremony afaik
9/29/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Thats weird
9/29/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: There were 2 dates to choose from where they would check your P
9/29/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: And then for when the ceremony would be was on october 9
9/29/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Also signed up later but didn't get email
9/29/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Alright cool
9/29/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I'm not 100% sure, you should send an email to check
9/29/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Mm might do thay
9/29/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: What email did you get the propedeuse message from
9/29/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: j.berger@tue.nl
9/29/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Hmm I'll look up another one
9/29/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: <Media omitted>
9/29/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: why is it adressed to all the candidates of the bachelor exam
9/29/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: it doesnt mention anything about the P anywhere
9/29/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: good question
9/29/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: It's not send to everyone. I didn't get it
9/29/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: And i shouldn't
9/29/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>

9/29/17, 19:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I went to complain bigtime this afternoon at the director of wi/inf
9/29/17, 19:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And just now I received this
9/29/17, 19:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>

9/29/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahahaha
9/29/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Now I'm getting real curious
9/29/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should I prepare something or not
9/29/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: N
9/29/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: No pull a tue and just don’t prepare anything
9/29/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
9/29/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Roel will be there as well 😜
9/29/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What I would be able to use is a sortof detailed list of all the things that have been badly communicated in the past year
9/29/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Take a Fontys flyer with you and give it to him
9/29/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because that is one thing I talked about with them
9/29/17, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I’d be happy to help you compile a list of mistakes over the last year
9/29/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes we'll do that somewhere next week
9/29/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks in advance
9/29/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If I bring a large list it looks like I was not just claiming stuff with no proof
9/29/17, 19:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maybe we can make an induction proof of errors 🙃
9/29/17, 19:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: base case: Roel Bloo heeft het verneukt []
n+1: Alles is verneukt {By IH} []
9/29/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahahaha
9/30/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: Hey, how can you be sure you've paid this year's tuition fee?
9/30/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Ask the TU?
9/30/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Or check your bank account
9/30/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: This
9/30/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and you should have gotten an email beforehand
9/30/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: that they would take the money from your account on the 29th
10/1/17, 01:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I thought we received an email that asked us to notify we are going to the P ceremony before 5th of October
10/1/17, 01:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: However, I cannot find that mail anymore
10/1/17, 01:18 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: You just got an email with the invitation pdf. And in that invitation they ask us to notify them if we are going to be there or not.
10/1/17, 01:20 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: <Media omitted>
10/1/17, 01:20 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: I think we should reply to that email

10/1/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: Hey, guys! Has someone did the quiz for Operating Systems. Are the conditions the same as in the previous tests - that we only have one attempt and limited time, because there is nothing written on top of the "take the quiz" button
10/1/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i thought the time was unlimited
10/1/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but yeah i made it and its only one attempt
10/1/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but it really shouldnt take you that long
10/1/17, 14:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I believe the time is unlimited vut you have 1 attempt
10/1/17, 14:15 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But it really shouldnt take more than 20 min
10/1/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and losing internet connection doesnt matter
10/1/17, 14:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yes i belive its until you hit submit
10/1/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: tru
10/1/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: aw ok. so its not different than the other tests. because if there is a ime limit my internet connection is pretty bad :D
10/1/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21680573‬: thank you, guys :)
10/1/17, 14:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also for anyone who is flying to another country or home for the holidays. Get your tickets if you havent. Tickets are skyrocketing now and a lot of airlines are already almost full
10/1/17, 14:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Just thought i might leave this here so people dont get ripped off too hard
10/1/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: When do we have holidays tho😂
10/1/17, 14:28 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Christmas

10/2/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: No
10/2/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: The dude told us we weren't meant to go there as a group and at that point we could still sit there, but next time we'd get kicked out
10/2/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which dude?
10/2/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: The guy that walks around there
10/2/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Didn't even realise that haha
10/2/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And how do they check which major you're from
10/2/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: They know what ED is
10/2/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: and having a group of 5-6 people sit together working on a ROD
10/2/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: makes it quite obvious
10/2/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahaha
10/2/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: True
10/2/17, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But we walked around, two of us glued, two used cardboard and two others were drawing stuff and such
10/2/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: does anyone know how you can control voltage using arduino (to power motors in different speeds) using external power?
10/2/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If you use the PWM ports you can change speed using that
10/2/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: okay thanks
10/3/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: With the wireless arduino connection, do I upload all the programs on the arduino through a lan cable and then remote control it with wifi, or do I have to upload it on wifi aswell
10/3/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: you can upload your program before hand, It will remain in your arduinos memory
10/3/17, 11:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Upload on arduino and yse wifi
10/3/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Alright not bad
10/3/17, 11:07 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Thanks
10/3/17, 11:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Np
10/3/17, 11:08 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: And I guess you should be able to upload a program over WiFi, but I'm not sure
10/3/17, 17:36 - Bas Gieling: does anyone know a way to control the arduino using an xbox or playstation controller? is it even possible with the yun?
10/3/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Yes and yes
10/3/17, 17:40 - Bas Gieling: cool, can you explain how?
10/3/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: https://www.google.nl/search?source=hp&q=how+to+use+ps4+controller+on+arduino&oq=how+to+use+ps4+controller+on+arduino&gs_l=psy-ab.3...5624.10302.0.10534.39.35.1.0.0.0.189.4108.16j19.35.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..3.35.3961.0..0j35i39k1j0i131k1j0i3k1j0i203k1j33i22i29i30k1.0.TPcn-SOkBB8
10/3/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: you can just bind controller inputs to represent keyboard inputs right
10/3/17, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: yes
10/3/17, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Stay away from ps3 controllers, xbox are fine, ps4 as well. You can either have it stimulate keypresses that are already on the arduino or you can go fancy and for instance use the values from the x and y axis of the joystick and with a formula calculate the power on the motors from that
10/3/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro&ved=0ahUKEwiEvsGI5tTWAhUSblAKHWxXC1MQFggkMAA&usg=AOvVaw2VmwS4TIDEQKnK0_t7z3oJ free open-sourced. just how a sfs student should like it
10/3/17, 17:48 - Bas Gieling: dacht je dat ik dat nog niet had gedaan?
10/3/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂sorry
10/3/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Will the xbone elite controller work as well?
10/3/17, 17:49 - Bas Gieling: the x and y axis stuff is actually what i was looking for :p i was wondering how you could make the arduino read the input from the controller
10/3/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You could send it over serial but that's not ideal but other solutions can be very time costly as well. A custom udp protocol would be really nice to use but might be a bit overdone
10/3/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: "a bit"
10/3/17, 17:53 - Bas Gieling: hmm aight, thanks :)
10/3/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I know of someone who made a whole interface along with custom udp protocal last year ;D
10/3/17, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Was really amazing
10/3/17, 17:55 - Bas Gieling: thats awesome
10/3/17, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I can't imagine the amount of credit they got for that
10/3/17, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: From what I remember not that much really
10/3/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because it's not a very vital part of your robot
10/3/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Unless you make it your specialisation maybe
10/3/17, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Se, tue shits on you no matter what
10/3/17, 18:30 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Guys, how did you connect the power amplifier to the arduino ?
10/3/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: In the remote control manual is a drawing hakan
10/3/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Of which wires you should connect
10/3/17, 19:21 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Do you guys have a paper card with proof of enrollment already?
10/3/17, 19:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Whats that ?
10/3/17, 19:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nope
10/3/17, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Nope
10/3/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: How should we let the TU know with how many people you'll come to the propedeuse ceremony? Just reply to their email with the invitation?
10/3/17, 20:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I did that Robin
10/3/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Aight I'll do the same then
10/3/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wait wut
10/3/17, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: We had that previous year
10/3/17, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But i suppose thats not gonna be every year
10/3/17, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Cuz that would be plain stupid
10/3/17, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And waste of papier
10/3/17, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: It is every year
10/3/17, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: It says geldig tot and then a date in 2017
10/3/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: It's my 3rd year on TUe now, and I got it 2 times
10/3/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: But not this year
10/3/17, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Need it though
10/3/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No clue
10/3/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Havent recived any
10/3/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Thought that was normal
10/3/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But appearabtly it is t
10/3/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Is t
10/3/17, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Isnt
10/3/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: What do you need it for? Campus card is enough for everything you need, and if you just don't respond to the vestide letter you get about 6 months before the next reminder :)
10/3/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: My dad needs it to get money from his work
10/3/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Huh wat
10/3/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Tell me more
10/3/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: :o how does that work??
10/3/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I want money from my dads work to go to college
10/3/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: He works at nato
10/3/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: They get all kind of benifits
10/3/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: 😂
10/3/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Really nice
10/3/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Like from the bullets?
10/3/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Oh wait thats actual xd
10/3/17, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: No, from the trum video, please don't fuck nato
10/3/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: But.. Why?
10/3/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No i was serieus
10/3/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Idk why
10/3/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ask @31640634783 he needed it too I think
10/3/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Not sure if he got it though
10/3/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: That's some nice arangements...
10/3/17, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Maybe you can just walk to STU
10/3/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Then they can fix it for you, explain that you really need it now
10/3/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: I believe it is like, in many countries education is very expensive and Nato want their employees to have children that study
10/3/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Yeah I'll go to stu tomorrow
10/3/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Otherwise they, or the student administration w&i should be able to provide you with a letter or something as proof
10/3/17, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Good luck!
10/3/17, 23:13 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Thanks!
10/3/17, 23:15 - Luke Houben: You can print a digital paper of enrollment through osiris
10/3/17, 23:16 - Luke Houben: https://osiris.tue.nl/osiris_student_tueprd/ToonPersonalia.do
10/3/17, 23:16 - Luke Houben: And click on "verklaring van inschrijving"
10/3/17, 23:49 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah
10/4/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: is it stupid to use servo's to drive our robot?
10/4/17, 10:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its harder but not impossible
10/4/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not if it works
10/4/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You need continuous rotation servos tho
10/4/17, 10:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But nake sure your servos can turn 360 yes
10/4/17, 10:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Because some of them are 180
10/4/17, 10:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also guys how do you test if your codes work. They say that serial1 is for the server and wifi. What if i want to test my stuff at home ?
10/4/17, 10:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ethernet cable
10/4/17, 10:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Fock
10/4/17, 10:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Guess i am going to medial markt
10/4/17, 10:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 👾
10/4/17, 11:00 - Bas Gieling: you got a ethernet cable with your laptop
10/4/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You got one with your laptop
10/4/17, 11:00 - Bas Gieling: an*
10/4/17, 11:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I dont have tue laptop
10/4/17, 11:00 - Bas Gieling: oh
10/4/17, 11:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I use my own
10/4/17, 11:00 - Bas Gieling: nvm then
10/4/17, 11:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 😅thanks tho :3
10/4/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: There are also some places on campus where you can get them I think
10/4/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But I'd buy one, yeah
10/4/17, 11:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah
10/4/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: aka motors :p
10/4/17, 11:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nope, continious rotation servos have the advantage of not needing a motor controller
10/4/17, 11:06 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: How do I connect 2 wires parallel with the breadboard ?
10/4/17, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: thanks btw
10/4/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Each row of 5 is connected internally
10/4/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Those new tables and chairs in auditorium are really nice
10/4/17, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Comfy, spacy workplaces with wallsockets and lights
10/4/17, 12:35 - Bas Gieling: nice
10/4/17, 12:35 - Bas Gieling: i just wonder how theyre gonna do big presentations in the hall there
10/4/17, 12:35 - Bas Gieling: like the OAJ
10/4/17, 12:36 - Bas Gieling: bc it didnt look like those things could move
10/4/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It looks detacheable
10/4/17, 12:36 - Bas Gieling: ah aight
10/4/17, 12:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: It is detachable and it pops up wheels actualy i think. I saw a staff person moving one on wheels
10/4/17, 13:26 - Bas Gieling: oh cool
10/4/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
10/4/17, 15:21 - Bas Gieling: no, that thing just doesnt work
10/4/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This, Roel said it himself
10/4/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: True
10/4/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Someone here who knows a great tutorial for R?
10/5/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 27263018‬: Have a look at the book R by Example. It's quite good and it has a lot of nice references.
10/5/17, 00:51 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Data camp
10/5/17, 00:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Short and straight to the point
10/5/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Were is the best place in Eindhoven to buy bolts and stuff for the projecf
10/5/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is Osiris and Canvas broken for anyone else too?
10/5/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Those are two things that are permanently broken
10/5/17, 11:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But lemme check
10/5/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Touché hahaha
10/5/17, 11:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
10/5/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I can't login, not sure why, problem on my end then
10/5/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks for checking
10/5/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah i had to login to get there and that worked
10/5/17, 11:03 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So im afraid its on u yeah
10/5/17, 11:51 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: guys, did anyone manage to connect to the Arduino Yun through PuTTY via an SSH connection ? I'm trying to run the following command: "telnet localhost 6571" but I get that the connection is refused, do you have any idea how to solve this ?
10/5/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 49397206‬: you shouldn't connect via telnet, use SSH instead, and substitute your arduino's IP for localhost
10/5/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: you can only send RAW commands to the arduino, SSH is disabled i believe
10/5/17, 11:57 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: no, it's not disabled, I managed to make an SSH connection with the Yun, my problem is when running the telnet command
10/5/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 49397206‬: It works on mine, but I apperently pressed some buttons I shouldn't have
10/5/17, 11:58 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: what do you mean ?
10/5/17, 11:59 - Luke Houben: Ssh into your arduino, indeed you can use telnet  localhost 6517 when you are in the ssh terminal. Make sure you use Bridge.start in your arduino sketch
10/5/17, 11:59 - Luke Houben: And #include <Bridge.h>
10/5/17, 11:59 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: Bridge.begin() you mean ?
10/5/17, 11:59 - Luke Houben: Yes
10/5/17, 12:00 - ‪+40 724 322 426‬: oh ok, yeh that's my problem I think
10/5/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: You can also use tcp
10/5/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: It works without any including
10/5/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Just open a TCP connection to the IP of the Arduino with port 2001
10/5/17, 19:03 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: Bridge.begin() causes our arduino to hang, any ideas why?
10/5/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Because it's a hangbridge
10/5/17, 19:22 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Lol
10/6/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: has the continuuous servo gone back in stock yet?
10/6/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: it says out of stock
10/6/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You can hack a non continious one to become continious
10/6/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: yeah well
10/6/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: don't have that either
10/6/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-hack-a-servo-for-continuous-rotation-Towe/
10/6/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: And can you do the opposite?
10/6/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Like limit the rotation angle on a continuous one
10/6/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You can set restrictions in the code I guess
10/6/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You can't, because the rotation feedback potentiometer is removed in the continuous ones
10/6/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Oh yeah ofc
10/6/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: seriously?
10/6/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: so how would you write a position?
10/6/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yep
10/6/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Not
10/6/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: damn
10/6/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: good thing i have two 180s lol
10/6/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: We are using them for an application where we have the camera pointed at them all the time
10/6/17, 12:02 - Bas Gieling: <Media omitted>
10/6/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yep
10/6/17, 12:03 - Bas Gieling: aight thanks :)
10/6/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, wait
10/6/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No
10/6/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I just realized my mistake
10/6/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: sec
10/6/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
10/6/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
10/6/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
10/6/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, this
10/6/17, 12:07 - Bas Gieling: yea thats what i meant
10/6/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: To my knowledge they are connected like this
10/6/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: They are connected like that
10/6/17, 12:07 - Bas Gieling: great, thanks :p
10/6/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: I found a clicker in the DS lecture room. Did anyone lose his/hers?
10/6/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: In case anyone else tries to use the bridge api on their arduino, the dbl organization blocked all APIs so they didn't have to support them
10/6/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: They forgot to mention this 😒
10/6/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Guys we tested the gymbal servos and everything works fine. But now we bought different ones and they don't want to move
10/6/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: They also operate on 5v
10/6/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Did you define them correctly and plug all servo's you defined in?
10/6/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I just disconnected the gymbal servos and connected the other ones to the same pins
10/6/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: And ran the same program
10/6/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: That should work normally
10/6/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Maybe the ones you bought are broken?
10/6/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: All 4 of them?
10/6/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: That would be a really big coincedence
10/6/17, 14:55 - Kevin Jilissen: Make sure the servo you have bought is connected correctly, they might use different colors for the cables etc
10/6/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: All 4 of them seems odd yeah then you're probably doing something wrong
10/6/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What type of servo's are it?
10/6/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Just standard model servos from conrad
10/6/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: One of them is even from alltros
10/6/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: The Tue supplier
10/6/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Was there a free copy of windows 10 available somewhere, like via the Tue website or something, or not?
10/6/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thought I remembered something like that
10/6/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 43411381‬: Windows 10 education is free
10/6/17, 15:02 - Kevin Jilissen: https://www.gewis.nl/member/dreamspark
There is somewhere windows 10 in the list
10/6/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks alot
10/6/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is Windows 10 Education limited to like 'Home' or something?
10/6/17, 15:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: As in features or something like that
10/6/17, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Think so
10/6/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I suggest buying enterprise for 27 euros
10/6/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Look up the digital key on google
10/6/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: "buy" 😄
10/6/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For 27 euros I prefer the legitimate enterprise version
10/6/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not for the ridiculous prices stores ask for it
10/6/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Gotta promote competition among companies
10/6/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Guys, does anyone have a 180 degre servo and wants to swap for 360 degree? I need one 180 degree (Engineering Design)
10/6/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: cant you just make it stop at 180 degress
10/6/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: No
10/6/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: 360 work differently than 180
10/6/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: The 360 is a continuous one and you can set the speed and the 180 is a regular one and you can set the angle
10/6/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Exactly ..
10/6/17, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: How strong is it?
10/6/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Oh I managed to find out what the servo problem was. Our servos were 5v but they were drawing too much amps
10/6/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: So don't buy too big servod
10/6/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Servos
10/6/17, 18:16 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Or get a better powershield
10/6/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: If anyone needs to 3d print anything for your project you can get discount 3dhubs.refr.cc/7SPG5S8
10/6/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: and you get 25% off on top of that for being a student
10/6/17, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: <Media omitted>
10/6/17, 18:47 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: <Media omitted>
10/6/17, 18:47 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: <Media omitted>
10/6/17, 18:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ah we don't have those ;/
10/6/17, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Anyone know a good tool to draw circuit diagrams?
10/6/17, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: kicad or fritzing depending on how advanced you want it
10/6/17, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: easyeda.com
10/6/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Ty I will check those out!
10/6/17, 21:47 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Not too advanced, just to show the idea
10/6/17, 21:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Then fritzing prolly
10/7/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Fritzing so shitty
10/7/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Meh for the non advanced circuits it's easy to use, works really easy out of the box and is clear for people who are not that good with electronics etc
10/7/17, 00:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Otherwise kicad or easyeda are things you should use but those are a lot less simple to use
10/7/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: When is the first examperiod
10/7/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: ?
10/7/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: The GEWIS calendar can tell you, but I'm too lazy to check for you atm
10/7/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: October 30th to November 10th
10/7/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Thanks
10/8/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guys, how are you guys going to dress for the P-ceremony?
10/8/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not full tuxedo right

10/8/17, 10:58 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: you can borrow my crocs for a day if you want to
10/8/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: what was the deadline for enrolling for q2 subjects?
10/8/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: october 15
10/8/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i believe
10/8/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Really, that early? That's like 4 weeks before it starts.
10/8/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
10/8/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Wow
10/8/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Glad someone asked, or I would definitely have forgotten :P
10/8/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Oh wtf
10/8/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Thanks

10/8/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: damn
10/8/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: This

10/8/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys get your shit together
10/8/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: true heroes don't wear capes, didn't expect it to be THAT early
10/8/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Sorry Max, I promise I won't do it again
10/8/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
10/8/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: 💪🏻
10/8/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jesus this is early, keep repeating this here
10/8/17, 14:35 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Does dbl algorithms or algorithms have a lower workload?
10/8/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: depends on if you're a leech during DBLs
10/8/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Mostly asking which costs less time
10/8/17, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: DBL takes 2 timeslots, but I'm not sure how difficult either subjejct is
10/8/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But in q2 it only takes 1 so it might just be in 2 where half of each timeslot is being used
10/8/17, 14:37 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: On planapp it's only 1 time slot
10/8/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: hmm I might be wrong, but I thought DLBs in general took 2 timeslots
10/8/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
10/8/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Nvm dbl algorithms has been moved to q3
10/8/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: what?
10/8/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: q3?
10/8/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: According to osiris that is
10/8/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: nice
10/8/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: what
10/8/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 27263018‬: Wtf
10/8/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well fuck that
10/8/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: so we've all been fucked
10/8/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: <Media omitted>
10/8/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: how the fuck am i able to get a correct planning if osiris and the planapp are different
10/8/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 21917788‬: That's for next year right?
10/8/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: oh thats next year
10/8/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: From next year on
10/8/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ez
10/8/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: oh
10/8/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: that's next year
10/8/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Oh
10/8/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: REEEEE
10/8/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Nvm im an idiot
10/8/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Still though then it's only half updated because currently you're still able to put it into q2 / q4 of your third year on planapp
10/8/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: tbh thats actually better for me
10/8/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: im kinda excited for dbl algorithms 😶
10/8/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Nice to know
10/9/17, 09:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Morning guys&girls.
For the meeting I have Thursday in the lunchbreak I am looking for the following:

It would be real helpful if you could PM me any (and all) solid examples you can remember of TUe lack of communication and/or broken systems/courses etcetera. Every detail since Y1Q1 until now
10/9/17, 09:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'll filter the stuff out that should be said right now
10/9/17, 09:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Trying to configure a list to hand over, so they don't wave it off like "just one case"
10/9/17, 10:56 - Bas Gieling: most recent example: the invitation for the p-exam ceremony being way too late for people with jobs to get a day off, especially at times like 14.00 and 16.00
10/9/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is included, seperate examples in PM please, else they might get flooded and lost
10/9/17, 10:57 - Bas Gieling: however it was already known that it was that day, but i had personally expected it to be in the evening
10/9/17, 10:57 - Bas Gieling: oh aight, im sorry
10/9/17, 10:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Np, all help is welcome 🙊
10/9/17, 11:52 - Bart van Dooren: did anyone receive a confirmation about that they received your email that you are present at the p ceremony?
10/9/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nope
10/9/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Didn't expect any 😂😂
10/9/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: I mailed them saturday and they responded that i could just come and that i am 'on the list' haha
10/9/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Same
10/9/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i didnt get a response
10/9/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Same
10/9/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Hey guys, For the correction of the u-profile holes we were told to "drop by the workshop" and they would fix it to us. Do any of you know where the workshop is on campus?
10/9/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Pretty sure it's in the basement of gemini, where the lockers are as well
10/9/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Thank you
10/9/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Last Friday the workshop was in the 2nd floor of gemini south
10/9/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Workshop SEL
10/10/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Are there more groups with an accu instead of battery pack? What kind of switch do you use
10/10/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: We have a accu
10/10/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: *A A C C U B O Y S*
10/10/17, 09:33 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: What switch do you use to turn it "off"
10/10/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Not really one, it's an old one and we don't really care if it breaks😶
10/10/17, 09:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: When did we have christmas holidays again?
10/10/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Holiday planning is on www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareScience2016
10/10/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Does anyone know where the helpdesk is for 4WBB0
10/10/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: there's a bunch of people in SEL in gemini
10/10/17, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: both students working on it, as well as teachers of the course
10/10/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: there are two teachers there
10/10/17, 10:08 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: So that is where the helpdesk is for getting the correct L298n?
10/10/17, 10:10 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: they have a bunch of them here
10/10/17, 10:10 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: in a box
10/10/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: okay great thanks Ilse!
10/10/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: anyone knows if you can get more jumper cables cheap somewhere on the tue? I though I heard someone mention that
10/10/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: does this reddit actually still exist
10/10/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: technically ye
10/10/17, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Sort of, it is replaced by csstudents but still a nice  place for permanent links
10/10/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Hey everyone, 
As the announcement for the Coaching Introductory Session on Thursday was quite late, the organisers have asked to post something here to make sure that everyone is aware of it. An announcement has been made on canvas, but if some of you missed it,  the session is on Thursday the 12th of October at 12:45-13:30 in Auditorium 16. :)
10/10/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what’s this for?
10/10/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: If you signed up for the coaching model 2, 3 or 4 then there is an introduction lecture about badges
10/10/17, 13:14 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: If you didn't sign up for anything, you are automatically in model 1, and this is not relevant for you
10/10/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Yeah thank you ^^
10/11/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Hi, we are looking for a trade a 1pcs MG996R -180DEGREE- Metal Gear Servo High Speed & Torque for the following dc motor:

10/11/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Done
10/11/17, 16:25 - Bas Gieling: because i want to sign up for a fifth course which apparently isnt possible on osiris
10/11/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Roel Bloo I guess
10/11/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Why would you wanna do 5?

10/11/17, 16:25 - Bas Gieling: because otherwise i cant fit the courses i wanna do in 3 years
10/11/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You're not allowed to do more than 20 ects per period
10/11/17, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: SO 4 is the max sadly
10/11/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You have to ask the study advisor, they can sign you up
10/11/17, 16:27 - Bas Gieling: well, there are others who did 5 subjects each quartile, so it is possible :p
10/11/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nope, there are people who take 5
10/11/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: During the kringgesprekken Roel said 4 is the max..
10/11/17, 16:27 - Bas Gieling: aight, thanks :p

10/11/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nah dude I’m not 4
10/11/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: He told me to tell first year combi students 5 is possible...
10/11/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You're less than 1 Max everyone knows that
10/11/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah more like 0.4
10/11/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He obviously doesn't have his info straight lol
10/11/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Depending on how much you value your social life?
10/11/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: So much unnecessary talking
10/11/17, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Its unreal

10/11/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Max 4 subjects, I tried to sign up for 5 but osiris wouldn't let me. There ar exeptions though with regards to people who more than one study.
10/11/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31627446682 Study advisor is the person to avoid rules
10/11/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: roel*
10/11/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Synonyms Stef
10/11/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Anyone have a tip on where to get cheap wire for our robot?
10/11/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Doesn't have to be breadboard wires
10/11/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Break down electronics
10/11/17, 22:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Stuff that is broken or you don't use anymore
10/11/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: To top it off it's fun to break things apart as well
10/11/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: It's like a euro for a meter lol
10/11/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But.. Breaking things :D
10/11/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: I stand corrected
10/11/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Just break shit
10/11/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: 😄
10/11/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I don't have anything I don't need 😅
10/11/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Speaker cable at hornbach is like 30 cents per meter
10/11/17, 22:26 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Not bad I suppose
10/11/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is like the student solution of all student solutions
10/11/17, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: using speaker cable as copper wire hahah
10/11/17, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I dismantled an usb cable
10/11/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: also cool
10/11/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: cause you get like 80 for each device you buy
10/11/17, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: so you probs have extra
10/11/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: but the real student solution would be to use the soldering tin at Sol for wiring
10/11/17, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: 0.20 euros a wire, male to male
10/11/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: App me personally
10/11/17, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Op=op
10/11/17, 23:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Gotta call a buddy but pretty sure best I can do is 0.03
10/11/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: That's a bundle of 10, if you need just one I'm cheaper
10/11/17, 23:33 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Okay okay illmake it 0.10
10/11/17, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: for 10?
10/11/17, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😏
10/11/17, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: For 1:p
10/11/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: On conrad you pay 11eu for 30 wires ;)
10/11/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahaha
10/11/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I know, I know
10/11/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm just messing
10/11/17, 23:47 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: I mean, just, the offer stays, if you find cheaper wires, go for it! If you don't :i can deliver at GEWIS during the break the next day (weekdays only)
10/11/17, 23:48 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Also if you need another wire, ask, I'll see what I can do
10/12/17, 09:46 - Luke Houben added ‪+31 6 42623926‬
10/12/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬ added ‪+31 6 83613724‬
10/12/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just now I had the meeting for discussing the organisation of the P-ceremony and some other Osiris related issues surrounding it.

For next year it will be made clear that Osiris should always be checked by students, because it does not always give a notification when some status is updated for you. Also, they will remove the "bring family and friends" line from the kickoff meetings. These should not even be placed there at all. Students will also get clearer updates regarding things such as the P-ceremony and other exam or administration related things
10/12/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Entering grades into Osiris is also a point of attention (obviously), because the teachers and administration cannot seem to agree on how to deliver eachother their work
10/12/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For the Planapp, this was not the right meeting because there were no responsible people present there. Larisa Camfferman will organise a separate meeting with the responsible person for the planapp for which she will invite me as well.
10/12/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Although it is straight up clear that it is a disaster
10/12/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Communication is key, is what we summarized at the end
10/12/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Roel Bloo came in late because he missed the invitation, and they basically sent him away because there were no relevant points for him
10/12/17, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So he left again after a decisive "dag" by Larisa :p
10/12/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So it is the same old story: The TU has broken shit, they are saying stuff will be fixed, but concrete plans lack?
10/12/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well no not quite
10/12/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Most of the things I mentioned will actually be done different next year
10/12/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Fixing the past is not possible
10/12/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Sounds like the TU should take a cursus on how to communicate
10/12/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: tru
10/12/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And the funny thing is that the people I saw today were really good at communicating, but the people that represent them towards us suck at it big time
10/12/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They acknowledged every issue and thought of solutions
10/12/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Gotta do DS now btw
10/12/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Stef is getting mad
10/12/17, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: THIS WEEKEND IS ENROLLMENT DEADLINE FOR Q2
10/12/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Also, don't forget to enroll for coherent packages and use packages as a whole, not just the courses
10/12/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: What?
10/12/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: wut?
10/12/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: what?
10/12/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: oh u guys didnt know?
10/12/17, 23:45 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: if you have all courses that make a package is not enough?
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: great sentence xd
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nope, apparently not
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: <Media omitted>
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Someone explain
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: well idk i could do this
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Bit late for use now isn't it?
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nah still possible
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: I already have one this period
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: TU didn't tell us this so just do it now Dennis
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Okay I'll try tomorrow, thank you!!
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 👍🏻
10/12/17, 23:46 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Love you
10/13/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: How do you find the coherent packages in Osiris? Tried to search for it but it didn't give any results
10/13/17, 00:06 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: And again a great example on how communication isnt proper on the tue
10/13/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not quite sure, I did not do it myself yet
10/13/17, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31631192870  how did you manage?
10/13/17, 00:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Still gotta find the responsible person for this
10/13/17, 00:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Getting closer though
10/13/17, 00:09 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Uhh let me see
10/13/17, 00:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Well at register for a minor I just entered 1 word that is in my coherent package and I pressed search
10/13/17, 00:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Then I select the package and press register
10/13/17, 00:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do we need to enroll for all of them immediately or just the one that your are currently doing or doing Q2?
10/13/17, 00:11 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I should do all of them so that you dont forget
10/13/17, 00:11 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I just did it to be safe
10/13/17, 00:13 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: But if you register for a coherent package can you still for example have the first course Y2Q4 and skip the first opportunity to have the second course
10/13/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Like if you register for the package they do not register you for all the courses already?
10/13/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Think not
10/13/17, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: That would be plain stupidity
10/13/17, 00:16 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: <Media omitted>
10/13/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good point Niels :p
10/13/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: And well isn't tue as a whole plain stupidity
10/13/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I have not idea then
10/13/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Guess I'll just ask bloo sometime then
10/13/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: But its also possible to start in y2 and end in y3
10/13/17, 00:17 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: So it should not matter
10/13/17, 00:18 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: And you can also just register for it and deregister if they add courses to your planning
10/13/17, 00:19 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh yeah that's true indeed thanks
10/13/17, 06:40 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: For all packages or only those you have a course of this year?
10/13/17, 08:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't know, I have not seen solid info for this, just know that it is a thing
10/13/17, 08:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Where on osiris can I find where to enroll for these packages?
10/13/17, 08:12 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Register - > register for a minor
10/13/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSch8e75RarAtLsXEHQ1MeoIXcl8zqWZpI4PhVnPbyf6LjLtcQ/viewform?usp=sf_link

If anyone would have the time to quickly fill in this form, that would be amazing. Its for USE :)
10/13/17, 09:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If i may give my opinion: it feels kinda weird in the sense that it feels like you assume we already have such a lock 😅. How can i recommend something i dont own?
10/13/17, 09:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And if not, i gave it anyway 🙃
10/13/17, 09:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'd recommend a fast luxurious car even though I don't own one
10/13/17, 09:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: :p
10/13/17, 09:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Okay True But thats different
10/13/17, 09:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You are different ge-earth

10/13/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks for filling it in, it's not meant to be assuming you have  such a lock. It's probably a bad questionnaire but we have to do it 😂😪
10/13/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is a very bad questionnaire
10/13/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Stfu
10/13/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hahahahaha
10/13/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: No I know
10/13/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But we need 50 people to fill it in
10/13/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I just miss the option "I don't need a fucking smartphone connected bicycle lock, for me it is okay as long as it keeps the moroccans away"
10/13/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Lmao
10/13/17, 09:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: What the hell, some questions are definitely messed up, this is not what our questionnaire looked like when we made it what
10/13/17, 09:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Just forget about it and ignore the mess
10/13/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Guys keep it nice and friendly and keep it spam free
10/13/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: holy shit you saved me
10/13/17, 09:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you cant deregister for a course
10/13/17, 09:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: you can Max
10/13/17, 09:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I did in Osiris when I accidentally registered for the wrong one
10/13/17, 09:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh rip
10/13/17, 09:46 - Luke Houben: It is allowed for SFS student to choose Web technology right?
10/13/17, 09:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yah
10/13/17, 09:51 - Luke Houben: Alright thnx
10/13/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I cannot for the life of me find a way to register for an entire coherent package
10/13/17, 09:56 - Luke Houben: Inschrijven - Minor
10/13/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You must register for a minor
10/13/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Instead of for a course
10/13/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: This
10/13/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And if you've not yet done this, but have followed a course already? That's not a problem right
10/13/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this is the worst
10/13/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: No it's not tommie
10/13/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is there someone who can find the preparation master data science package?
10/13/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Alright thanks :)
10/13/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Does anyone know if u get the P certificate after u finish ur first year courses
10/13/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: in second year*
10/13/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I'm pretty sure you go through the same deal as everyone who got it in the first year, but just don't get a ceremony
10/13/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And you probably have to get the certificate somewhere else
10/13/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: okay
10/13/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Like, pick it up at some office or whatever
10/13/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But I'm pretty sure you get one
10/13/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: thank you :)
10/13/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Np, I hope I'm right tho, someone might need to confirm my story ;)
10/13/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: AFAIK thats correct Tom
10/13/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Definitely right, you get one, but no ceremony
10/13/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Last year a friend of mine had that, went with his parents and in a suit, just got his certificate from the reception 😂
10/13/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Lmao okay
10/13/17, 12:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: https://studiegids.tue.nl/opleidingen/bachelor-afbouw/bachelor-technische-bedrijfskunde/algemeen-ie-oud/examencommissie-ie/diploma-uitreikingen/#top
10/13/17, 12:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Here you go
10/13/17, 12:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: All your questions answered
10/13/17, 12:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Long story short
10/13/17, 12:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Nope
10/13/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I already read that
10/13/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Just the ceremony doesnt take place but u can register for next
10/13/17, 12:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What do you mean ?
10/13/17, 12:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: You need to have all your courses withing 1 year for that ?
10/13/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: For ceremony yes
10/13/17, 23:50 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Are there people who have Osiris saying that the maximum amount of people per group is reached when registering for 2ID50?
10/13/17, 23:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering Paul de Bra is the responsible teacher I'd say you'll be fine if you mail him 😊
10/13/17, 23:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Gives the course the chance to be free points as well
10/13/17, 23:53 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Didn't he quit today?
10/13/17, 23:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, he did
10/13/17, 23:54 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: According to Osiris it is George Fletcher now
10/13/17, 23:55 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: If it is the same as last year, it will be
10/14/17, 00:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would be great :D
10/14/17, 00:32 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I remembered there was no limit on the amount of people when i registered
10/14/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: for the guys with social robots:
10/14/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: do you think it is fine to write a little more than 800 words?
10/14/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: the assignment states "consisting of about 600-800 words"
10/14/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this does not sound like a hard limit does it?
10/14/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I think you're better off using between 600-800
10/14/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: since he clearly states in one of his examples that he gives
10/14/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: that it's TOO LONG
10/14/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I have 827 ffs
10/14/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: where can i find these examples you speak of?
10/14/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i have a little over 900 lol
10/14/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Canvas -> social robots -> files -> examples of essays
10/14/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: Id say that using a bit more is fine
10/14/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 827 is definitely fine i think
10/14/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah, I mean
10/14/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: take a look at the whole course
10/14/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: you can do whatever you want and you'll be fine
10/14/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hahahah yeah true
10/14/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: theres one in the examples which has over 1000 words
10/14/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and he says "a little too long"
10/14/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: *a little*
10/14/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: seems like 900 would be fine right
10/14/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: well, 960
10/14/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: i can't login on any tue site
10/14/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: says password incorrect, while i know it's correct
10/14/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: your account got locked
10/14/17, 15:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: you'll probably have to see the notebook people
10/14/17, 15:08 - ‪+31 6 19979158‬: what do we have to know for the upcoming discrete structures test?
10/14/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: PLEASE
10/14/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: what the fuck but i haven't registered for the second quartile yet
10/14/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: who are the notebook people?
10/14/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Pol it happens to all of us every once in a while
10/14/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: waiting for a while solves it
10/14/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: like it will work in an hour probs
10/14/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: alright cool
10/14/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: i'm stressing out because i don't know if my tuition fee is paid
10/14/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: stu won't respond to my question
10/14/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Discrete structures chat, scroll 1 second up
10/14/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 19979158‬: okay thanks, my bad
10/14/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
10/14/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Know the feeling
10/14/17, 15:57 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, did anyone found out what to do with 2ID50? Data modeling 
It says maximum is reached
10/14/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 19979158‬: wait im not in that chat lol
10/14/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Mail responsible teacher
10/14/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'll check for link Timon
10/14/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 19979158‬: ah i found it, but thyanks
10/14/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh great
10/14/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But material should be as follows
10/14/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Until page 129 Max said
10/14/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Partly into chapter 6
10/14/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Starting from 3
10/14/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 19979158‬: okay awesome thanks!
10/14/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Np!
10/14/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Exactly 15 minutes will do
10/14/17, 20:30 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: how many words do you people have for your essays for use robots?
10/14/17, 20:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 0
10/14/17, 20:32 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Look back in the chat a bit
10/14/17, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 930
10/14/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: ah, I have about 840, so I guess that should be fine
10/14/17, 20:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol yea
10/14/17, 21:53 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: In the planapp I have DBL algorithms in the 2nd quartile but I cannot register for it because it is available in q3 which contradicts what the planapp says.
I contacted the study counsilor but I doubt they will answer before the deadline. What can I do now ?
10/14/17, 21:53 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: <Media omitted>
10/14/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I thought it is still in Q2 for this year
10/14/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Go to osiris -> register in menu bar -> type in 2io90 in the text field -> register for course module -> register
10/14/17, 21:56 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
10/14/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Ohh right 😂😂
Sorry i didnt see 2018 2019
10/14/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: My bad 😇
10/15/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: So I wanna register for 2ID50
10/15/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: But it says it is full, what now?
10/15/17, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Mail responsible teacher
10/15/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: can you just plan 2IO90 DBL algorithms in q4 instead of q2? or should you first consult the study counselor for that?
10/15/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: and for me also 2ID50 is full
10/15/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: in the kickoff meeting for this quartile, bloo said that we have to get an exception to do business information systems in q3 next year
10/15/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyone know who we have to contact?
10/15/17, 12:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, what about the person who actually is responsible for this shit, like, maybe, uhm, your study advisor?
10/15/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Idk, it is just a weird guess
10/15/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what, contacting roel bloo?
10/15/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I guess?
10/15/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: because he's always particurairly helpful or what
10/15/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: he'll just say "got no time, fuck off"
10/15/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: as always
10/15/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, he is responsible for it, so GL
10/15/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ugh
10/15/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks tho
10/15/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but i fucking hate bloo
10/15/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: tbh
10/15/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: snoke = bloo confirmed
10/15/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Send the email to studycouncelorsfs@tue.nl, then you get a chance you get to deal with Yves
10/15/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright
10/15/17, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hope so
10/15/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Or he'll say nothing for 2 weeks
10/15/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: anyone else got the problem that 2ID50 is full?
10/15/17, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: GUUS PLEASE
10/15/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: YOUR MOM DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BEING FULL
10/15/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also: it has been said like 2746927384 times already
10/15/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thanks
10/15/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes, it is full, and yes, you should e-mail the lecturer about it
10/15/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I get some of use have the same questions but can you read back like at least 30 messages before asking something
10/15/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i have a problem with 2ID50 being full too if ur wondering hihi
10/15/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you do this you have actual proof when he does not respond properly or not at all
10/15/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: but ill mail lecturer dont hit me
10/15/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: is there anyone else doing DBL algorithms in q4?
10/15/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Probably
10/15/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yes
10/15/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: did you discuss that with the study counselor or did you just register for it?
10/15/17, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Just register
10/15/17, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: <Media omitted>
10/15/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: It would be weird to have to ask permission for moving a course to another quartile
10/15/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: if u register now you will be doing it in q4 this year
10/15/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: or i dont get ur problem maybe
10/15/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: the problem is that i don't know if it is a problem if i decide to do it in q4
10/15/17, 13:17 - Luke Houben: I don't think it is, why else would they also give it in q4
10/15/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This used to be the case for every subject you wanted to move pre-bachelor college
10/15/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Some people moved Data modelling from 2nd year to 1st year last year without asking study advisor and that wasn't a problem afaik
10/15/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Extrapolation of policies is a very dangerous thing on the TU/e :P
10/15/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: did u mail george or paul about the registrations for 2ID50
10/15/17, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: George Fletcher is the responsible teacher
10/15/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Isn't Paul retiring?
10/15/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes, so they need to mail George
10/15/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: <Media omitted>
10/15/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Is this guy still responsible for 2ID50?
10/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Read one message up
10/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: .
10/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol yea thats paul de bra
10/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hes a hero
10/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: oh yeah
10/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh
10/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is paul actually retiring?
10/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: shit
10/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: im gonna miss him
10/15/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thank you for participating paul
10/15/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: He already retired

10/15/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Looks like he is working on an Iranian nuclear program in that picture

10/15/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: is it studentcounselorsfs@tue.nl or studycounselorsfs@tue.nl?
10/15/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: so you guys are fucked because other people enrolled earlier?
10/15/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: well, i emailed both of them

10/15/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: no i'm fucked because i can't login to any of the .tue domains
10/15/17, 16:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its not like roel responds fast

10/15/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: doubtful lol
10/15/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: stu is out on a stroll aren't they
10/15/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: worth trying to
10/15/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: mailed stu on wednesday, no response
10/15/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: cunts
10/15/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: For me they tell me it's full, so I'm just gonna send everyone that is even slightly related a mail and then they can fuck right off
10/15/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: i find it very strange that they know already for a year how many people have to do this course and they do not take measures
10/15/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: according to our curriculum in the study guide we should do it q2
10/15/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: maybe many resits
10/15/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hmm
10/15/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i as well have the problem with 2ID50
10/15/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: shit
10/15/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ikr
10/15/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: maybe they will extend the registration deadline after fucking up as always
10/15/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i certainly hope so
10/15/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz fuck me
10/15/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so
10/15/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: how are we gonna fix this
10/15/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: did anyone call yet?
10/15/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Guys I am not sure whether this is a known fact but STU has a phone service using which you can get your answers immediately
10/15/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sending a mail wednesday means calling Friday in my opinion if you have no answer then
10/15/17, 17:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We all know they suck at communicating
10/15/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: even sundays?
10/15/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Realizing Sunday that you're fucked is of course their fault, but there were fixes
10/15/17, 17:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No Stef
10/15/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: will you guys register for another course now in case they don't fix this?
10/15/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: didnt this happen before
10/15/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: with another course
10/15/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: you mean with the USE course with limited space?
10/15/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yeah
10/15/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: could be the case
10/15/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: no clue
10/15/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i remember sth like that
10/15/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering it is a mandatory course for your major they will need to fix it
10/15/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will be fine
10/15/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just sent more mails to Bloo and ESA
10/15/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Send*

10/15/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: should do the trick
10/15/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: and student andministration W&I
10/15/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lol
10/16/17, 09:42 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: has anyone called the ESA helpdesk yet?
10/16/17, 11:05 - ‪+351 935 579 164‬: Does anyone from which time till when is the arduino help desk (for Engineering design) open?

10/16/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Everyone?
10/16/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No only the tiny girls from Turkey
10/16/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: guys
10/16/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: one picture per slide please
10/16/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: we don't need this group spammed to hell for 3 angels of the same information
10/16/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Doesn't your phone collect the images in a bunch ?
10/16/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh wait Web Whatsapp does not
10/16/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: On your phone they should be bundled
10/16/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: nope ;)

10/16/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: And he will register everyone that mailed to studycounselorsfs i think
10/16/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: https://1ejaars151617ook1000.petities.nl/
10/16/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Want the same compensation as the first years of 2018/209? then sign this petition ;)
10/16/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: How about a petition saying that they shouldnt give us a one time discount but just make studying cheaper for the full study?
10/16/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Make a petition i'd say
10/16/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: studying is already fucking cheap though
10/16/17, 15:40 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I demand cheaper study
10/16/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: U rich storm?
10/16/17, 15:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: no
10/16/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: not at all
10/16/17, 15:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: he pays 2006
10/16/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: but i can still study
10/16/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Ome DUO has enough money for all of us
10/16/17, 15:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: also he is dutchie so he get the government free doritos
10/16/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: how much do you guys pay?
10/16/17, 15:41 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i pay 2006 too cuz i am eu
10/16/17, 15:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: but people out of eu pay 10k
10/16/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I was kidding anyway
10/16/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: but we always want more money ourselves right?
10/16/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: It is cheap for u yes
10/16/17, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yeah that's shitty for non-eus
10/16/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Maybe its relative cheap but the discount they are giving now makes us pay more rent on our loans
10/16/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: So as student they arent making it easier for me
10/16/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: let me put that this way: if we don't get the discount the rent will go up anyway since those 18/19 firstyears will get the 1000 anyway
10/16/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yes
10/16/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: it's pretty unfair but I won't die from paying less than a euro per month more
10/16/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: maybe if I studied arts and crafts
10/16/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It isn't, because it is 2006 because the government subsidizes ir

10/16/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: its compounded so it will become more than a euro per month if u dont pay in high speed
10/16/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yeah I meant it more that if you're not from the eu it's pretty shitty to have to pay such a sum to study
10/16/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Studying here is cheap af
10/16/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Studying in  America is way way more expensive for example
10/16/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: well beep the fucking boop 3 euros a month, I'll die if I don't buy those vegetables biologically!

10/16/17, 15:49 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I know
10/16/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Expensive biological hipstershit
10/16/17, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Always see woman with short haircuts during work-hours taking all the time they want in the grocery store picking the most biological cucumber because their husband earns so much they have to do jack shit themselves
10/16/17, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Daan please keep it study related

10/17/17, 11:51 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: After working fine for the first couple of weeks, the Arduino Yun is now not showing up anymore under the ports in the Arduino IDE... So I can't upload my code anymore. Anyone who encountered this problem as well and know what might fix it.
10/17/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Did i miss anything important yesterday?
10/17/17, 11:52 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: What does the IDE say in the bottom right corner?
10/17/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Yes, your code broke it, try uploading the default empty program over internet cable
10/17/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Login to 192.168.1.1, password is arduino
10/17/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or your usb-serial converter is broken
10/17/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: There are two ports I can select, COM6 and COM7 and if I click those, it says Arduino Yún on COM6 / COM7 but when I try to for example "Get Board info" it says "Native serial part, can't obtain info"
10/17/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: How could I have broken it with my code? I didn't do anything fancy yet... But it is good to be aware of that.
10/17/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: It also does not work on other laptops
10/17/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, because the usb-serial converter is on the board :p
10/17/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I knew that... ^^ Ehm, how could I check that?
10/17/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Do you use the right usb cable?
10/17/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: There was one usb cable that is not able to transfer data
10/17/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Only power
10/17/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Feel so stupid now... Thanks. Learn something new again! ^^

10/17/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is there a way in Java to actually do a correct modulus operation. Like, -1 % 2 = -1 according to Java, but I want it to return 1 (like it should). But preferably in a way without having to write a complete function
10/17/17, 20:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is there a method/operator for this ?
10/17/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Isn't it basically just adding an if statement that checks if the value is below zero, and if so, add the modulus so the value is above zero?
10/17/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, I know, but it would've been nice to just do it in one line, for example
10/17/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: k = ((k % m) + m) % m
10/17/17, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yes
10/17/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: That works
10/17/17, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: That's exactly what I meant, thanks :)
10/17/17, 20:07 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Actually, I'm not sure this works. Depends on whether (-6)%10 would be -6, or -4
10/17/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: -6, it is not 4
10/17/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: -4 mod 10 is 6
10/17/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: -6 mod 10 = 4
-4 mod 10 = 6

10/20/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Guys, who else is doing Business Information Systems in Q3 next year?
10/20/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Me
10/20/17, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I hope so at least
10/20/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Roel said something about asking for permission
10/20/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: How and who are you gonna ask?
10/20/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I assume that will happen when you submit your planning after you get 90 ECTS
10/20/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I don't know who is supposed to check it
10/20/17, 10:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alrighty
10/20/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 57866325‬: Ask Bloo in an email

10/20/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: You are using the wrong port
10/20/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Go to tools-->port and select the one that says COMXX (Arduino Yùn)
10/20/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: With 0< XX =< 99
10/20/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 22560797‬: Also wrong board right🤔
10/20/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, that as well

10/20/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I had the same problem
10/20/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I use 4 dc motors, maybe I can help?
10/20/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: I don't have experience with those. You just wanted to show me how very good you were with 6-wired dc motors
10/20/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what? no man i was the one who didnt know what to do
10/20/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: cmon man dont be like that

10/20/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz i hate you max
10/20/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but mostly bc of the spam
10/20/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 😢
10/20/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not even spamming but okay
10/20/17, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: @31624553225 So I have a dc motor with hall encoder (whatever that means) and it comes with 6 wires, but the power amplifier that we got from the course only has 2 outs. Any idea how I'm supposed to connect the motor?
10/20/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: put it in the stopcontact
10/20/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no jk i have no clue
10/20/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Probably 4 are for the encoder and 2 for the actual motor
10/20/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: sounds really hard tho
10/20/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Can you send pictures?
10/20/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: 4 encoder 2 motor yea
10/20/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
10/20/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: 1 should be motor- and 6 should be motor+
10/20/17, 13:15 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: afaik
10/20/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: or 1 and 2
10/20/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Yes, a picture would be nice
10/20/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: <Media omitted>
10/20/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: What's the model
10/20/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: wauw that really is a nice one
10/20/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: shitload of torque i suppose?
10/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: stef please
10/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no that one was serious
10/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
10/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: im wondering cuz it looks big
10/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Anyhow, seems liek red is motor+ and black is motor-
10/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: try those
10/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: wondering why you'd need so much torque
10/20/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Can you make a close up picture of the backside of the motor, where you connect yhr wire
10/20/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: The
10/20/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That is one hell of a sexy motor
10/20/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: <Media omitted>
10/20/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: damn those rims 😍
10/20/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: ?? I have no clue guys 😂
10/20/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: where did you get that
10/20/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Well, sorry to say, but I'm not sure about it either
10/20/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Uhm i believe its from volumerate
10/20/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Thanks anyway :)
10/20/17, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Cindy what kind of motor is it?
10/20/17, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ahh dc
10/20/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hall encoder is something with magnetic force. My guess is you have to power the 4 lines to let it run in a sequence
10/20/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Looks more like a stepper motor to me
10/20/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah
10/20/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Was just gonna sa y that
10/20/17, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is no stepper motor
10/20/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Its a dc motor
10/20/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: <Media omitted>

10/20/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31642007885
10/20/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Power pin 1 and 6
10/20/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The encoder says at which position the motor is, which you are probably not gonna use
10/20/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah that's what the hall sensor is for
10/20/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There's a little magnet in there that can tell you where it is I'm guessing. I agree with Rick, hooking up 1 and 6 might work
10/20/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Thanks guys, I'll try!
10/20/17, 13:56 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31642623926  try not to sent unrelated photos
10/20/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is very related, dear Job
10/20/17, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Then let us not deviate any further from the path then
10/20/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Is there anywhere on the uni you can get/buy screws?
10/20/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: vertigo sells a lot of shit, but you have to be bouwkunde student
10/20/17, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: iirc
10/20/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: ID and BE only
10/20/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: There is a industrial district 5 min cycling from uni, you can google of there is a praxis or gamma or any other stores who might sell screws
10/20/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Else you're screwed
10/20/17, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Thanks!
10/20/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: kill yourself
10/20/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: woops sorry, wrong chat
10/20/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wtf
10/20/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: there is a gamma can confirm
10/20/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: The praxis is next to the gamma
10/20/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: Im not screwed 😖 😂😂
10/20/17, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂😂
10/21/17, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
10/21/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: At our ROD some servos don't work on 5V, we have to connect it to the voltage regulator from the battery pack directly
10/21/17, 22:19 - Luke Houben: Are you using the 5+V output on the motorshield? Since we also had trouble with that one but once we connected it to a 6V output it worked perfectly
10/21/17, 22:19 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If you are sure your servo's can handle that
10/21/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'm using a buck/boost converter and have tried everything from 4 to 6v (at which they are rated)
10/21/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Also tried the motorshield one
10/21/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But nothing seems to work
10/21/17, 22:21 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Are you sure your code is correct?
10/21/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well it works with the sg90 servo's
10/21/17, 22:22 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And I'm just using the general servo library and from what I'm seeing online that should work just fine
10/21/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You sure its 180 degree?
10/21/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Try writing:  servo.writeMicroseconds(2000);
10/21/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll try that ;D
10/21/17, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Did it work?
10/21/17, 23:20 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Is this from Hobbyking
10/21/17, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Cause we got the same craptastic pieces of shit. Couldn't get them to work, drawing too much current and having spams everytime I try to change the rotation
10/21/17, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: So we went to one of the guys runnig the course such that we could swap it
10/22/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: We also had a servo doing that. It was heavier than all our other servos
10/22/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: We don't know why because the power on the specifications was met
10/22/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But it just wouldn't turn
10/22/17, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Anyone with use robots knows if we have any kind of lecture tomorrow?
10/22/17, 20:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we dont
10/22/17, 20:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: he went through an exam last week
10/22/17, 20:13 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: yeah no lecture
10/23/17, 10:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: For everyone with Social Robots: I made a summary of all the articles, so that you dont have to read and evaluate all 200 pages yourself

10/23/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So Daan, Ruben and I just had a meeting regarding the plan app
10/23/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And I have to say, it was very productive. They really listened to all of our problems and ensured us that they will be addressed in the next release
10/23/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: However, one big flaw in their communication: *the plan app is still a beta version*
10/23/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It’s being made and tested here at this university, and when it’s fully operational it will be released across the country
10/23/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: In January or February the second version will be released, addressing a lot of the current issues
10/23/17, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But they agreed that mentioning the beta part should have been done way earlier
10/23/17, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Why are we forced to use a beta then? Seems like a bad excuse
10/23/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, again, before @31643470096 kicked me without reason: How are we supposed to plan our electives then?
10/23/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Rick planning your elactives works with some bumps in the road, unless you are an incapable fucktard
10/23/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You do however have to check too much by hand that should be checked by the plan app
10/23/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, I did get 0 feedback on my choices, for example
10/23/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 👆
10/23/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So, unless you see the fucking mount everest as "a bump", I don't agree that statement is true
10/23/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Some people picked discrete structures for next year while this is the last year it is given for example
10/23/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: And besides, even if this shit isn't finished yet, why not give us access to the old planapp which actually works?
10/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: This kind of things shouldnt be the fault of the students
10/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Nah, let's just use everyone as guinea pigs and if it's wrong it's their problem
10/23/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is the fault of the communication between the project manager and the faculty board
10/23/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yves heard only just now that it was a beta as well
10/23/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: You still have access via mytue
10/23/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Again, not our responsibility
10/23/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nope, but it is a fact
10/23/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: They literally ordered us to use planapp and submit it before the end of the year
10/23/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Thst is no miscommunication
10/23/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: This is just damage control and lying
10/23/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: One or multiple people fucked up, lots of people are getting duped because of it, and nobody is really trying to fix it or taking responsibility
10/23/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This as well
10/23/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The people we spoke with today are doing exactly that
10/23/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, this is coming from you guys through an unofficial channel
10/23/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is, WI/INF people thought it should be a final version with minor bugs
10/23/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Project manager did not notify them it wasn't
10/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Taking responsibility would be sending an e-mail, saying "Guys, we fucked up, please say it if you have been duped"
10/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And they did agree that they should have been way clearer to us in all their info, to make sure we did not stress about it
10/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: In other words miscommunication
10/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Easy to say afterwards
10/23/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah don't you think I share your opinion?
10/23/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Heck I was the one barging into an Office pissed off at a Friday afternoon
10/23/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which is why this meeting took place
10/23/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, well, did you press them to take action?
10/23/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (Im not blaming you, but they just fucked up royally)
10/23/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's just that everything is unclear to everyone. The assistants of the planapp project manager don't even know whether the planapp checks amount of courses or ECTS in defining your total courses
10/23/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Which people just need to take responsibility for
10/23/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah I know Rick, I know..
10/23/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well these people were very clear in that it is indeed fucked up, but the project manager already had a meeting elsewhere (conveniently)
10/23/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Bas something is his name
10/23/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: And it sounds like they are gonna focus on the next generations and we end up with all the fuck ups
10/23/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not Luttik
10/23/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
10/23/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Planapp.tue.nl
10/23/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Good luck
10/23/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We are the test generation Thomas
10/23/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just like with Osiris
10/23/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The old planapp is also unusable
10/23/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Thats okay but then they should be held responsible and fix everything so that we arent fucked in the end
10/23/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Osirisplanapp started as a BEP
10/23/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
10/23/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm trying :p
10/23/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I told them to do exactly this
10/23/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Probably won't happen, but still
10/23/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: And the people who sceduled DS next yearz they are already fucked
10/23/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yep that got confirmed
10/23/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That should not happen
10/23/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But it did
10/23/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But it should not have been the case
10/23/17, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yeah...
10/23/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It boils down to this; we should have been Made aware of the fact that the app is still a beta, so that we could be extra careful planning. However they failed in this and that suck big time. Can’t change the past tho so we have to deal with it. They will try to fix everything and inform us about it. Whether they actually will is something only time can tell, all I can say is that at least we tried and so far it feels like they take it seriously.
10/23/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How do we know they took it seriously you ask?
10/23/17, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well, Roel Bloo was not invited
10/23/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 👆🏻👆🏻
10/23/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But it will cost us in some cases at least 2k extra
10/23/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Then u are an idiot if that is bc of the plan app
10/23/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Bc u can always go to the study counselor when you think its wrong
10/23/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait but you're perfectly allowed to do DS in Y3 right?
10/23/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is a recommended prior knowledge course but not compulsory
10/23/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or am I mistaken
10/23/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I mean it sucks donkeyballs, but it is not like I attend lectures for that course anyway
10/23/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So the Y3 option should work equally to what some of us are doing now
10/23/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No thats true
10/23/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Just because it works doesn't justify the facts that those people don't get lectures
10/23/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: fact*
10/23/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: lol
10/23/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: True, that’s one of many big mistakes
10/23/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Although those lectures suck anyway and you benifit more from doing it itself
10/23/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Urself*
10/23/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Aren't there video lectures?
10/23/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Probably
10/23/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Nope
10/23/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Not for Discrete
10/23/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Correct, but why would you need another year?
10/23/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: i never mentioned that
10/23/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's still the same amount of courses right?
10/23/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: i never mentioned that, daan
10/23/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh yeah Rick did
10/23/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sorry
10/23/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: stupid
10/23/17, 17:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's me
10/24/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: guys
10/24/17, 09:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyone else doing DBL algorithms next quartile?
10/24/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Should have
10/24/17, 09:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But no
10/24/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Yes
10/24/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: @31621372984
10/24/17, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yup
10/24/17, 09:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you guys think its gonna be a problem that we havent even had the course algorithms yet when we have the DBL?
10/24/17, 09:52 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Does anyone know if you can remove the camera from its cable for engineering design?
10/24/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Once, for sure
10/24/17, 09:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If you wanna be able to put it back tho, that’s another question
10/24/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: haha I want to put it back
10/24/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: For me it wasn't an issue. Last year it was programming a difficult problem which iirc was NP
10/24/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you have the entire quartile for that?
10/24/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Yep
10/24/17, 10:05 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: In the exampelary bachelor plannings they always put DBL algorithms before regular algorithms, so it should not be an issue.
10/24/17, 10:06 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: It's quite a big project and the idea is to optimize your solution to the point where it can handle huge input sizes with reasonable results
10/24/17, 10:11 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Anyone got a soldering iron we can have for a few minutes?
10/24/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You can solder in Laplace
10/24/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: i think they give them in the laplace ?
10/24/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alrighty
10/24/17, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: sounds quite fun actually
10/24/17, 10:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: In that case, no clue
10/24/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You could just cut it a cm or so before the cam
10/24/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And later solder it back
10/24/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Laplace, Flux
10/24/17, 10:17 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But then you will need isolation tape as well to prevent short circuiting
10/24/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Flux is closed today
10/24/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: The soldering place
10/24/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Oh really
10/24/17, 10:19 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: That's convenient
10/24/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Innovation spaces has soldering irons as well
10/24/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Every other student as well
10/24/17, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: Sel also has soldering irons
10/24/17, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: In gemini
10/24/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or just go to vertigo
10/24/17, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You can always walk in anyway
10/24/17, 11:38 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: does anyone have exprience with servo starting to vibrate and ignoring input?
10/24/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yes, @31649673225 does i believe
10/24/17, 11:39 - Luke Houben: Are there any people in here who know how to fix the skippy screen of the arduino camera?
10/24/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: they all start at seemingly random and don't stop until the input is removed
10/24/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: I think your servo gear is stuck, you can open it and check
10/24/17, 11:39 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Isn't the camera just low framerate?
10/24/17, 11:40 - Luke Houben: If I reduce the resolution it becomes less skippy but zoomed in
10/24/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 49673225‬: @31621372984 Plz don't
10/24/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: You could ask @31649673225 luke
10/24/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: he knows
10/24/17, 11:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: @31649673225 , how does this work?
10/24/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: any ed questions may be directed to @31649673225's PM, he knows
10/24/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if i ever have a question i ask him
10/24/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: he always knows
10/24/17, 11:41 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: the gears are not stuck as the servos will operate normaly again when it input is removed and connected again
10/24/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: We are having the same problems
10/24/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am thinking about it being overloaded, but we are still 3 times below the maximum load ;/
10/24/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Check if your wires are really connected well. We had some problems where it seemed like the wires were all connected but it would move randomly sometimes. But when we reattached the wires everything was working fine
10/24/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: There is a reset button on the arduino, next to the LAN cable. Try pressing that one
10/24/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: Wait dont
10/24/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: Some students in my year (im a third year sorry) pressed buttons on the arduino without knowing what they were doing because the arduino was malfunctioning, after they did that the university blamed them for breaking the arduino and they had to pay for this one and a new one
10/24/17, 11:57 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: Just go to the helpdesk and let them kill your arduino
10/24/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: Then it is not your responsibility
10/24/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: The remote control manual says that only the WLAN reset will brick the arduino
10/24/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: My Arduino just got reset
10/24/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: <Media omitted>
10/24/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: By the helpdesk
10/24/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: I mean it is okay if you know for sure what you are doing, but if you are not sure then please dont break it yourself, quite an expensive joke😅
10/24/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: They reflashed the settings
10/24/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait why would you pay for the broken one AND a new one
10/24/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: Because they needed an arduino to finish the course
10/24/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: And they had to pay for the broken one
10/24/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah so use that and give it to the course after? :P
10/24/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then they have a new one
10/24/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jesus
10/24/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And they couldn't just pay and loan another one from the course?
10/24/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: I dont know the exact story i just know that they had to pay for 2 arduinos and that that they didnt like it 😂
10/24/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Obviously :p
10/24/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Would go mental if that happened
10/24/17, 19:28 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: In the end, did anyone figure out if there is a way to improve video quality streamed from arduino?
10/24/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: There isn't
10/24/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: The arduino just isnt made to encode video
10/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: the video quality is pretty good for us actually
10/24/17, 19:49 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: just a very small area it can view at a time
10/24/17, 19:54 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: You should not change the settings since otherwise the network could not cope
10/24/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So basically if one group does it it's unfair competition and if all groups do it no one can use it
10/24/17, 19:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Interesting..
10/24/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Probably yeah
10/24/17, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Haha you're plotting something?
10/24/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I wouldn't dare
10/24/17, 20:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And wouldn't state it here either
10/24/17, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Anyone else reminded of the prisoner's dilemma?
10/24/17, 20:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What is that?
10/24/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Yay I can cheat now
10/24/17, 20:11 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Thanks Daan
10/24/17, 20:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
10/24/17, 20:13 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Already forwarded this to my friend @JFG
10/24/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So now I'm on de stek as well?
10/24/17, 20:14 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Keep it serious guys
10/24/17, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: In short, it's when two or more parties could benefit themselves by doing some action, even though they'd all be better off if nobody did that. Feel free to look it up.
10/24/17, 20:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Cool!
10/24/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Okay, so the thing about the yùn is that it contains an (embedded) processor and a Linux processor, and the function of the Linux processor is to send the commands on Serial1 and transmit the video
10/24/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If you are able to reflash the Linux processor you can upgrade the video quality
10/24/17, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That makes no sense 😂
10/24/17, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: U broke one, now u pay for 2
10/24/17, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Is job also admin in third year sfs chats?🤔
10/24/17, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You looking for a coup?
10/24/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: No it's just that he's also admin in the 1st year group chats for whatever reason
10/24/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: so by induction
10/24/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: (yes job this is about discrete structures don't mind me)
10/24/17, 22:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But you did not proof he's admin of year 2 by assuming he is admin of year 1
10/24/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: JA STORM
10/24/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: no I assume he's admin of year i
10/24/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: base case 1
10/24/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: holds
10/24/17, 22:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: kek
10/24/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: No I don’t admin the group of the third year
10/24/17, 22:47 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: induction forever disproven
10/24/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: But next year I will probably
10/24/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Sounds as a legit proof
10/24/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: only time will tell
10/24/17, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Si
10/25/17, 09:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: My Putty constantly gives network error: connection timed out error
10/25/17, 09:43 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Does anyone know how to solve this? Arduino is connected with micro usb rn
10/25/17, 09:44 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: And ethernet cable
10/25/17, 09:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Make sure your settings are set right in the putty and in the adapter settings
10/25/17, 09:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or keep on retrying
10/25/17, 09:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh with cable
10/25/17, 09:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: For me that works, just keep retrying a few times
10/25/17, 09:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thats true sometimes it buggs
10/25/17, 09:45 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Apart from that make sure you get your settings right
10/25/17, 09:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Ive been having this issue since yday idk how many times i should try
10/25/17, 09:45 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I checked all the settingns from the manual and they seem to be correct
10/25/17, 09:46 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hmm
10/25/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: u sure your ethernet adapter uses the static ip?
10/25/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: and is disconnected from wifi, could cause putty to think it has to target the wrong interface
10/25/17, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Did you put in the cable before you turned on the arduino?
10/25/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Okay i solved it
10/25/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Tried another 10 times and it connected
10/25/17, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Thank u
10/25/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Our arduino suddenly doesn't activate any of the servos and DC motors anymore. Camera is still working, even the provided code isn't working. Batteries are full, motor shield still working, doesn't run when connected to laptop either. Lights on the arduino are still lit, anyone know what might be wrong?
10/25/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Ive no idea how arduino's work but it sounds like a protective shutdown
10/25/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: How do you connect your components to your batteries?
10/25/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Is there a common ground?
10/25/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Servos via breadboard, have worked before. DC motors via motor shield
10/25/17, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Yes there is a common ground
10/25/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: If you connect too many components to motor shield
10/25/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: The 5V output
10/25/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It will not work as it has a 300mA limit
10/25/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 2 DC motors
10/25/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: That should be fine
10/25/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: And would not explain why the servos won't work
10/25/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah but how do you connect your servos then?
10/25/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Erythinf worked 10 min ago
10/25/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: To which output?
10/25/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: To the arduino itself
10/25/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Dude
10/25/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It says on there
10/25/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: And the batteries
10/25/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Idk wtf you mean
10/25/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Do not use the 5V output of arduino
10/25/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: It has 3 cables
10/25/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: We don't
10/25/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So how many volts do your batteries output?
10/25/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Servos can mostly handle up to 6V
10/25/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 6 for the servos 12 for the DC motors
10/25/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Sander alles werkte net nog het heeft echt niks daarmee te maken
10/25/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ahh oke
10/25/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Netjes
10/25/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: How would I check/fix
10/25/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Arduino aan en uit zetten?
10/25/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Ground from the Arduino connected to the other grounds?
10/25/17, 11:30 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Should all grounds be connected?
10/25/17, 11:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: It doesn't have a ground cable
10/25/17, 11:32 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: The arduino does have an GND output. We made the mistake a couple of times that we did not connect that ground to the rest, and then it would not work
10/25/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: If there is not a common ground the arduino will probably act up yes
10/25/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Oh yeah duh I meant the camera doesn't have a ground
10/25/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: We swapped all the ground cables but that didn't fix it either
10/25/17, 12:45 - ‪+39 338 432 6231‬: Is there an exercise lecture for Discrete Structures today?
10/25/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: https://www.win.tue.nl/~hzantema/ds.html
10/25/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It does
10/25/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It has 3 cables
10/25/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: It does not
10/25/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: it has 1 cable
10/25/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: it is fixed anyway
10/25/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Hoe
10/25/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: How?*
10/25/17, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: guys our continuous servo broke down, a high torque one. Does anyone know here to get another one short notice? everything on alltrons is sold out
10/25/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Does anyone have the old programming exam of folder ? Could you sent it to me please :)
10/25/17, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Tinytronics has lots of stuff, when you order you can almost immediately pick it up
10/25/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: By mail?
10/25/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Sure
10/25/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You have it?
10/25/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yeah
10/25/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Thx
10/25/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I sent it
10/25/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Is this the empty one or are these your answers?
10/25/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Empty one
10/25/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Alright thank you very much
10/25/17, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait do you need to redo it or is it for new students?
10/25/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Mentor students are asking for it
10/25/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nice
10/25/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Playing good guy
10/25/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: hey man
10/25/17, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: woops, wrong chat
10/25/17, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: hi

10/25/17, 18:40 - ‪+31 6 40634783‬: yes ty
10/25/17, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 🙋🏽‍♂
10/25/17, 20:48 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Anyone with algebra for security wanna help with my code for Euclid's algorithm?

10/25/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I might be able to help yes ;D
10/25/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Which programming language ?
10/25/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: How are we actually supposed to hand the assignemnt in ?
10/25/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: on canvas. the thing was just created
10/25/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh that explains thanks
10/25/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Java
10/25/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: What are you having trouble with?
10/25/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah alright, did it in python so Ruben can probably help you better :p
10/25/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I envy you
10/25/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hahahahaha why so ?
10/25/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Java is horrible for this stuff
10/25/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Why didny you do it I. Python
10/25/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Because that is correct lol
10/25/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: python makes life so much easier
10/25/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I know
10/25/17, 21:03 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: So for the first iteration I get the remainder of the 2 input polynomials but afterwards my program crashes, mind if I pm you?
10/25/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah sure!
10/25/17, 21:04 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: This
10/25/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Don't know how to code in python sadly :(
10/25/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
10/25/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Python is pretty easy to learn, especially if you've already got some programming experience
10/25/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Turning the algorithms from the reader into python code is almost as easy as just copy paste lol
10/25/17, 21:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I agree it's really easy to learn and it'll make your life so much easier
10/25/17, 21:19 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Oh sounds good, will try when I find some spare time :) Thanks!
10/25/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Java is horrible, period
10/25/17, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I fully agree
10/25/17, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: python is like pseudo code except a pc likes it
10/25/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: a pc is not the only one liking python
10/25/17, 21:27 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: a computer sorry

10/26/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Do we have discrete structures lecture tomorrow?
10/26/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 49397206‬: yes
10/26/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I can confirm Odad is correct ;)
10/26/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: The corner parity is correct
10/26/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Since we're working with even parity and the corner is only 1 if the sum of all parity bits is uneven
10/26/17, 12:15 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And since you've got 3 ones on either side the sum is even
10/26/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Oh its all parity bits together
10/26/17, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Thanks!
10/26/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Hey guys
10/26/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Anyone got some servos to spare?
10/26/17, 12:46 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: only a broken one :p
10/26/17, 12:47 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I think we actually have an extra one, will ask rn
10/26/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: How powerfull?
10/26/17, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: ours are pretty strong
10/26/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I got like 3 spare s90 ones
10/26/17, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But those are not that strong
10/26/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Oh, the weak ones will also do i think
10/26/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Where you @?
10/26/17, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: MF but servo's are @ home rn
10/26/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Ah
10/26/17, 12:52 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: And tobin?
10/26/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Im not at uni
10/26/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Ill have one spare one tomorrow
10/26/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: group says they want to sell
10/26/17, 12:55 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Wow ok

10/26/17, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Online I found that I should add myself to the dialout group, but I don't know/understand how, please help?
10/26/17, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Have you tried turning it off and on again?
10/26/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Nope
10/26/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: It has been off since the last time I got this message, so I guess yes
10/26/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Try a different USB port
10/26/17, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: For the people in Engineering Design, can we use the 0 and 1 pin on the Arduino as well?
10/26/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: or do we have to add something specific to the arduino code?
10/26/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: because when I hook up a motor to one of these pins, the motor starts spinning constantly, even though I put the output to 0/LOW
10/26/17, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Motor or servo?
10/26/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I think you have to do pinMode(0, OUTPUT)
10/26/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: For both pins
10/26/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: yes I have also done that
10/26/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: its a dc motor
10/26/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: one with only 2 connections
10/26/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: A servo Can hooked up using a lib on the Ax But a motor Idk
10/26/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: for forwards and backwards
10/26/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Why not use an motor controll board ?
10/26/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: <Media omitted>
10/26/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: they dont come with a board or anything
10/26/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: they just came supplied like this
10/26/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Why didn’t you order a board ?
10/26/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: they work fine without one
10/26/17, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: when I hook up the other one to pin 10 and 11 it works fine
10/26/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Check if there is a ~ next to the number
10/26/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Some of the pins are pwm some aren’t
10/26/17, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Digital pins I’m talking about
10/26/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: yes, 10 and 11 have it, 12 doesnt
10/26/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: pin 0 has RX next to it
10/26/17, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: pin 1 has TX next to it
10/26/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Those are for sending and receiving data as far as I know
10/26/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Rx and Tx
10/26/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: according to the arduino website they can be used just like the other pins
10/26/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Try two other PWM pins and see if it works
10/26/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: yeah that was my next step, I was just wondering whether I did something wrong
10/26/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: I also tried to do this with pin A0 and A1 with the pins set to output
10/26/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: but then the motor doesnt work at all
10/26/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Those are analog pins
10/26/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: I will try something
10/26/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: thanks anywa
10/26/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: y
10/26/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Who has some pwm motor knowledge?
10/26/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Our motors are driving normally, everything is fine. But when we reverse only the left side of the h bridge gives an output. I tried changing some numbers and it seems like the right side in reverse only triggers when inputting 255 as a value
10/26/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Nothing less
10/26/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Nothing more
10/26/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31649673225 can help
10/26/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Try a different port
10/26/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Had the same problem
10/26/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Make sure the port has a ~ on it
10/26/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: We have the same problem... please let me know if you find a solution
10/26/17, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 30686090‬: We also have the same problem
10/26/17, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: We have the problem that putty suddenly disconnects and can't reconnect again until the arduino is reboot
10/26/17, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: Also when we did not just upload an programm over the ethernet cable
10/26/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I had this occur once
10/26/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: functioned fine afterwards though
10/26/17, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: oke thanks maas
10/26/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: haha sorry xD
10/26/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: xd
10/26/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: iksdee
10/26/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: I fixed it
10/26/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: different port worked indeed
10/26/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Both ports has a ~ though
10/26/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: So not sure why it happened
10/26/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: If you use the servo library, then the PWM on ports 9 and 10 doesn't work. On the internet is that detaching all servo's should work, but that doesn't work because of a bug in the servo library.
10/26/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: wait so we should be trying to keep pwm and non-pwm devices separately?
10/26/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: like put one entire component on only pwm pins and other components on only non-pwm pins?
10/26/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Really? On our Yún, I think we used almost all PWM ports (definitely including 9 and 10) and it seemed to work fine
10/26/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: It was port 9
10/26/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Actually
10/26/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: So guess that explains it
10/26/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: If you don't call Servo.attach then there is no problem. As soon as you called Servo.attach, the PWM on ports 9 and 10 will not work anymore.
10/26/17, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: The reason why this not works is that the servo library claims one timer to make the control signal for the servos. This is the timer that is normally used for PWM on ports 9 and 10. If you detach all servo objects, the timer should be given back to the PWM on ports 9 and 10, but because of a bug in the servo library, that doesn't work. digitalWrite will of course work, but with that, you can't regulate the speed of your engines.
10/26/17, 22:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Peeps
10/26/17, 22:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Where could I find the P-ceremony pictures again?
10/26/17, 22:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or is that link shared in this chat
10/26/17, 22:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Other chat

10/26/17, 22:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: This time its not on them tho lol
10/27/17, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: @31625164039 Jord: You forgot your screwdrivers
10/27/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Are you still in Gemini?
10/27/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Yes, same spot
10/27/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: I'll be there in 5min
10/27/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 46506857‬ left
10/27/17, 11:42 - Bart van Dooren: Someone has a micro servo like this spare which i can buy? I am on the uni and can pick it up
10/27/17, 11:42 - Bart van Dooren: <Media omitted>
10/27/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: You could also buy it at TinyTronics and pick it up at 13:00!
10/27/17, 12:22 - Bart van Dooren: I have one now but thanks for the tip
10/27/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
10/27/17, 13:39 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: couldn't you have asked that 2 days ago? :p
10/27/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: we still needed it then hahaha
10/27/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: change of plans
10/27/17, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: :(
10/27/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: does someone have a holder left for four batteries?
10/27/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Did you short yours?
10/27/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: yeah
10/27/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: shorty
10/27/17, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: I'm the most experienced person in my group... which cannot end well hahah
10/27/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well for some people to be above average some others need to compensate, so thank you 😊
10/27/17, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: hahah
10/27/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: does someone maybe have a lithium battery charger that I can borrow?
10/27/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What time?
10/27/17, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: what do you mean?
10/27/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What time do you need the lithium battery charger
10/27/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And is it meant for lithium 18650 batteries or other batteries?
10/27/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh nevermind I thought you said tomorrow for some reason, sorry
10/27/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: well preferably before tomorrow morning
10/27/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's going to be an issue :p
10/27/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: hmm
10/27/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You can use a battery charger that fits other batteries as well?
10/27/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maybe your parents have one
10/27/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Most chargers can fit a variety of different batteries
10/27/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: They have a normal one yes
10/27/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: but not one for lithium
10/27/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Most regular chargers dont work on lithium batteries
10/27/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh really Nimo, is it the case then that lithium battery chargers work on others but not the other way around?
10/27/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That could be my mistake haha
10/27/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I'm not sure, but they can't be interchanged at all
10/27/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I thought*
10/27/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: My charger can hold Lithium batteries as well as rechargeable AA batteries for example
10/27/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: You are at home already?
10/27/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes
10/27/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Do you have it in Eindhoven?
10/27/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no
10/27/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Tilburg
10/27/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Oh thats a little far
10/27/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thanks anyway
10/27/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah the journey could take you about 3 hours if NS feels like it
10/27/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: good luck ;)
10/27/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: thanks I need it
10/27/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: Charging them takes fucking long
10/27/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Couple of hours
10/27/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Depends on the amps you run through them
10/27/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: In 5 hours my 18650 went from 3.2 to 3.9V
10/27/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ahh but did you use a proper charger or one of those single battery things that don't even fit in regular wall sockets?
10/27/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: Okay maybe that's it
10/27/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
10/27/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This cost me about 12 euros from Banggood.com one day
10/27/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 40997398‬: That's sexy af
10/27/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Can choose between 1.0A or 0.5A as well
10/27/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah But you use lithium batteries for other things than just this stupid project
10/27/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So it makes sense to Buy such a charter
10/27/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Charger
10/27/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And using it as an external battery for your phone is possible as well if you place the cable the other way around with batteries in it
10/27/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But why would you if it’s only for this project lol
10/27/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Owning a proper battery charger for only €12,- is not that far-fetched I think :p
10/27/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wait that is kinda cool
10/27/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ah can it also charge regular batteries?
10/27/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Then true, that is nice

10/28/17, 08:41 - ‪+31 6 83323849‬: check teh manual, you have to add somthing like ?action=view
10/28/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Now we know the IP of Daan's Arduino😈
10/28/17, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: View is stream

10/28/17, 08:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ours does not work with the link from the course guide either
10/28/17, 08:51 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: You have to change the ip adress in the link
10/28/17, 08:53 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Have you made the arduino work over WiFi?
10/28/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You need to change your WiFi settings of your laptop
10/28/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: And connect to the search and rescue wifi
10/28/17, 09:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah dude
10/28/17, 09:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It worked perfectly over wifi last time
10/28/17, 09:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Explain. IP is set to our own
10/28/17, 09:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Is mf available for printing?
10/28/17, 09:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Mf closed right now
10/28/17, 09:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: No idea why
10/28/17, 09:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Opens 9:30 right?
10/28/17, 09:05 - Bas Gieling: it opens at 10 in the weekends

10/28/17, 09:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh it appears firefox needs a manually added http in front of the link
10/28/17, 09:10 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Should've used waterfox
10/28/17, 09:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ...
10/28/17, 09:11 - Bas Gieling: tell em ruben
10/28/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: What is the password to the search and rescue network?
10/28/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: It's pretty urgent :p
10/28/17, 09:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Oh damn, good lock to everyone who has their ED demo today!
10/28/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 49397206‬: rescuepw
10/28/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You don't have it?
10/28/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Nah, I have it next year
10/28/17, 09:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I envy you in a way but also don't
10/28/17, 09:22 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Yeah, good luck! It's indeed luck you need, skill is barely involved: if you dont have enough luck the wifi network will just crash like every previous year 😂
10/28/17, 09:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: lol
10/28/17, 09:22 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Let’s hope so
10/28/17, 09:23 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Maybe we can just fake that it works then even tho nothing does
10/28/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: "yes, so using the hyper modern cutting edge technology we designed for this subject we determined some terrifying news! It turns out those rubber duckeys aren't the only things in need of rescue! Check out these invisible ducks which we saved using mentioned technology! See? There are at least 20 of them in our safe zone! "
10/28/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I'll use telekinesis to rescue them
10/28/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: I'll stop now
10/28/17, 09:28 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: :)
10/28/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Yes all fun aside , good luck! Don't forget to laugh when you accidentally crash into another robot!
10/28/17, 09:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I will use telepathy to tell the duckies that death is inevitable and resisting it is pointless. Everyone dies and there is no escape. Instead of saving our robot motivates them to die in peace🦆
10/28/17, 09:39 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: @31648187618 the cunts changed the ip adres
10/28/17, 09:40 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Atleast that happen for us
10/28/17, 09:40 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: So check if they changed your ip adres as well

10/28/17, 12:54 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: We picked up 0 because some robot blocked us and then said we kept bumping into them

10/28/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: At the demonstration, we cut the head off
10/28/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Of the casualty
10/28/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: 😂

10/28/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: The camera was indeed useless

10/28/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Not only camera input lag, just lag in general, for servos and motors
10/28/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Everything just responded really late
10/28/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Thank u

10/28/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah the network was a bit picky. Some people actually had camera footage, ours just got disconnected after 10 minutes
10/28/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: But during testing in gemini everything worked fine
10/28/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wat de fuck

10/28/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: and study more
10/28/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Uhh they somewhat are
10/28/17, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: In the second part
10/28/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: but you can be like 60% sure he'll put something with the banker's algorithm in (pulled the percentage from my ass btw)
10/28/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Bankers algorithm
10/28/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: thats not the only thing you pull from your ass
10/28/17, 13:49 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: In the slides or what ?
10/28/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yeah, it's the graph stuff with deadlocks
10/28/17, 13:51 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: and which process gets which resource etc
10/28/17, 13:55 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Is that what max asked in the other chat
10/28/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Yup
10/28/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Our camera is updating a frame like every 10 seconda
10/28/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Anyone know a fix? Lol
10/28/17, 14:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: don't use it
10/28/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: use the big view camera in the room
10/28/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and your spotter
10/28/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The commands tend to get through a bit quicker than the camera footage
10/28/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: This
10/28/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Our camera had a 5sec+ delay
10/28/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yerp
10/28/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Idk how but we got 12 casualties
10/28/17, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: We couldn't connect to the arduino at all
10/28/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: With your actual pickup system?
10/28/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yes
10/28/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: But our battery died halfway
10/28/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 49397206‬: http://www.strawpoll.me/14257553 survey for ED
10/28/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Otherwise we would have gotten way more
10/28/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Damn dude
10/28/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Yeah we were so surprised
10/28/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: We even had two casualties in one trip one time
10/28/17, 15:25 - ‪+31 6 18608079‬: Idk how we did it
10/28/17, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: We had one with our mechanism and one was stuck on a confetti thingy  that was stuck on our ROD, so also two at once
10/28/17, 15:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
10/28/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did the old staff guy place his butt in front of the big screen camera as well for you guys?
10/28/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And the crew kept walking in the path of ROD's as well
10/28/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah, we once had 5 tutors standing around or ROD so we couldn't see jack shit
10/28/17, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I've hit so many feet
10/28/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I started hunting feet at a certain point
10/28/17, 15:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Was way more fun and activity
10/28/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: I just started hunting other RODs :p
10/28/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah that was fun as well
10/28/17, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Especially hearing the "EEYY WTH" in the same room after you hit one hard
10/28/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: hahahaha exactly
10/28/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: the sad part was we couldn't help us because ours wouldn't turn anymore because of its weight and could only drive with a slight angle to the rigth
10/28/17, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: At a certain point I saved a victim by pushing it out of the arena, but it appeared to be a part of someone else's ROD and they did not want to count it as a victim. It looked like one on the big screen..
10/28/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: haha we saved to pieces of paper but they didn't count either, so lame
10/28/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
10/28/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This was quite fun, too bad it had so much stress to it
10/28/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But it's nice to have no exam and a relatively high passing chance
10/28/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: after the jury I had no stress at all :p, since the actual thing in audi only counts for 5%
10/28/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: a bit more
10/28/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Shall we move this to the spam chat?
10/28/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Audi and jury count for a total of 20% together. Of which the jury is 2/3 and audi is 1/3
10/28/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Yes, sorry tutle
10/28/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is course related again haha, grade percentages
10/28/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: turtle*
10/28/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yes it’s very busy course related
10/28/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Your point is clear ;p
10/28/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Thanks guys
10/28/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Some people say everybody has to hand in the report for their group, not just one member, is that true?
10/28/17, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No
10/28/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Makes no sense considering you have to enter the group number and not your own name
10/28/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Stijn is gewoon retarded
10/28/17, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Hij gaf mij stress
10/28/17, 18:27 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: How much does the jury grade count then?
10/28/17, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Is it graded
10/28/17, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 20% or something
10/28/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Or 10
10/28/17, 18:33 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Well fuck
10/28/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: We did absolutely nothing other than drive forwards and backwards in a not-so-straight line
10/28/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You need to get a 5 for 0.6*report_grade + 0.2*live_performance + 0.2*jury_presentation_shit_thing
10/28/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: 5.5 for individual
10/28/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: for the full grade the jury is like 7% and the performance 13%
10/28/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: or something alike
10/28/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You can pass without your ROD working
10/28/17, 18:34 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Have faith
10/28/17, 18:35 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Alright, we'll see
10/28/17, 18:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: this yes.

10% is the preliminary design poster.
5% is your individual HWA's and meetings before the preliminary design fair.
35% is your individual HWA's and meetings after the preliminary design fair.
30% is the final report you have to hand in on the faggot website.
The remaining 20% is awarded for today's activities. Of which the jury is 1/3 and the live performance 2/3 (iirc)
10/28/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What if you saved 0 casualties?
10/28/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Does that result in a 0?
10/28/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no
10/28/17, 18:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: According to multiple tutors points are awarded for various activities
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you ROD did not move at all you don't get many points I suppose
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Such as?
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But driving around gives points
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So who's checking
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Being able to turn and navigate should give points
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: rescue attempts should give points
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah ours couldn't connect to the network
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well there were a lot of crew members and multiple camera's present
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Hence did nothing
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So I suppose that was the reason you had to place so many stickers with your number on the ROD
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think they were just grading along the activities
10/28/17, 18:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For all the numbers
10/28/17, 18:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: From my knowledge tutor is 35+5% report is 50 and today is 10
10/28/17, 18:57 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: so the face that we kinda stopped driving around because it was pointless is not good?
10/28/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nee Dimi
10/28/17, 18:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah i guess prelim goes somewhere too
10/28/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahah
10/28/17, 18:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is exactly what our tutor wrote down for us in detail because I asked for it
10/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: can we reupload our reports you think?
10/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: My point is it would be weird if report isnt 50 %  because tecnicly thats our "final". And finals are never below 50% as far as i know. Anyway you might be right considering this is a project
10/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: just try
10/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: we missed the pdf poster
10/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you get a new different upload confirmation link/code
10/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Then it should be fine
10/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: SHIT
10/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should it be included
10/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: my group told me we should have
10/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: fuuck haha
10/28/17, 18:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just mail it to the course
10/28/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: someone else handedd it in from my group though
10/28/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah I did not include it either and the deadline just passed
10/28/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: so I'm not sure if we can reupload like that
10/28/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yup
10/28/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I see that too
10/28/17, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm just going to mail it to the course right now to be sure, but they have it already so that does not make a lot of sense
10/28/17, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I think so too
10/28/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: does it say it has to be included?
10/28/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is not included in the grading rubric
10/28/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So you don't get any points awarded or deducted for it
10/28/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: my group told me that it should be, but I couldn't find it either
10/28/17, 19:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: False alarm
10/28/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: pfew
10/28/17, 19:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I asked them about it, but they didn't respond yet
10/28/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: <Media omitted>
10/28/17, 19:08 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: seems like it should have been in there
10/28/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Why didn't they include an appendix box to the template if you need to use it...
10/28/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: idk
10/28/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I guess the 4WBB0 organization are gonna get 288 emails with the poster :P
10/28/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: We added it for some reason
10/28/17, 19:12 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: odd
10/28/17, 19:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: We did too just to be super sure
10/28/17, 19:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
10/28/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Was it in the rubric?
10/28/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nope
10/28/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Since they tend to follow that quite strictly
10/28/17, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: We had to hand in a copy of the poster during the pdf, so they already have it
10/28/17, 19:15 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: True
10/28/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think it won't pose any problem
10/28/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering an appendix is never graded anyway
10/28/17, 19:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: that's the place where you dump all shit that could be useful or funny but is not safe for your work
10/28/17, 19:42 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: not safe for work you say?
10/28/17, 20:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: <Media omitted>
10/28/17, 20:12 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Not finished yet summary for Social Robots

10/28/17, 20:32 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Does the printshop at meta works on Sunday?
10/28/17, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I believe so? It did on saturday at least
10/28/17, 20:46 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Great, thanks man!

10/29/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: didnt anyone make pictures of the example questions discussed in the social robots lecture? Cant seem to find them anymore
10/29/17, 11:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanks papa maxu
10/29/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Maybe some others could pitch in as well
10/29/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They are all over the SR chat at least
10/29/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Someone else and I both sent the whole batch in separate messages
10/29/17, 11:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: can I join the sr chat by any chance ?

10/29/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: My mistake, it appeared to be the one for the group work
10/29/17, 11:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No big chat
10/29/17, 11:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: also if someone watched the black mirror episode whats your opinion on It? what is the message for you? do you also have the feeling it is trying to portray that robots cant replace humans to the same extent. but the end fucked me up and if someone can explain I whould love to hear their opinion
10/29/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: To me it also showed that robots can actually replace a person until scary amounts
10/29/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not exactly the same, but maybe even more than you would like
10/29/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yeah something like that
10/29/17, 11:59 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: she knows its wrong (thats why the ending) but she loves him too much
10/29/17, 11:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: hmm I agree on the love part but I think the end is honestly for the daughter not for her
10/29/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Throughout the whole episode it annoyed me that it was one big commercial telling you to not use your phone while driving
10/29/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That should be common sense
10/29/17, 12:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i think the part of her that wanted him back died on the cliff and now she has him not so much because of the love the robot cant give her back ( he cant be like her husband and that's what she wanted sadly). but she kept him mostly for the daughter. notice how the robot is hept in the attic. in the beginning they talked that everyone who died in the family house got all the memories about them kept in the attic
10/29/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Damn you thought about it way more than I did
10/29/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I watched it and that's it haha
10/29/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: She probably still keeps it, because it resembles her man. Impossible to get rid of it even though it's not exactly the same as he was. Has to do with them being so similar, both personality and appearance wise. Maybe also a means to provide a visual for the daughter of her father, but who knows. Up for your own interpretation, which makes these episodes so great.
10/29/17, 12:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: exactly
10/29/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or because he cost her a shitton of money. I'm not throwing away my PS3 either while I'm not using it
10/29/17, 12:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: LYFE TIPS
10/29/17, 12:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :D
10/29/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: "Jump off the cliff" would prove otherwise or she said that with the prior knowledge that he wouldn't jump.
10/29/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And he is the cheapest and easiest way to have sex for her
10/29/17, 12:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I mean, I'm always open for coffee lol
10/29/17, 12:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ok... didn't think of it that way daan but sure whatever rustles your duster
10/29/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
10/29/17, 12:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just throwing in some extra possibilities
10/29/17, 12:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: well we gathered a few backed up opinions on the episode so that's good :3
10/29/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I mean what would you do with a real life woman in your attic that does not need food or emotions
10/29/17, 12:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :\
10/29/17, 12:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: fair enough :}
10/29/17, 12:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahaha
10/29/17, 12:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: no wait
10/29/17, 12:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i will ask her to teach me OS
10/29/17, 12:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: :<
10/29/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahaha
10/29/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Go study
10/29/17, 12:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Don't think about this episode too much
10/29/17, 12:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: anyway back to work thanks for your opinions guys and
10/29/17, 12:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: good luck
10/29/17, 12:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: what is your strategy for social robots besides watching the episode + movie ( like how do you study ? summary or full articles ?)
10/29/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Max's summary
10/29/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And think about the approaches/theories a bit more
10/29/17, 12:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just so they have a place in your brain
10/29/17, 12:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: and by approaches and theories you mean ?
10/29/17, 12:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: the virtue / utilitarianism ?
10/29/17, 12:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: that sort of things?
10/29/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nah the nature of activities approach for example (reading that right now)
10/29/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Capability approach
10/29/17, 12:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: those things
10/29/17, 12:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: ahh get it
10/29/17, 12:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: so basicly the summary with emphasis on the approaches and theories
10/29/17, 12:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: thanksu dann
10/29/17, 12:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: daan
10/29/17, 12:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: *
10/29/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: npo
10/29/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: np*
10/29/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes
10/29/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Look at the example exam to check which parts should be more important
10/29/17, 12:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I personally think it will be quite similar to the actual exam
10/29/17, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: by the way shouldn´t we receive the grades for the essay and portfolio before entering the exam?
10/29/17, 12:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
10/29/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes that is true according to the regulations
10/29/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: All stuff that has nothing to do with the grade for the final exam should be graded before the date of the final exam
10/29/17, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Iirc
10/29/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
10/29/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Ive listed all 10 example questions from the lecture in a handy file so you can practice them more easily
10/29/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thanks ;)
10/29/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
10/29/17, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: im putting in the answers right now but you can start with them if u want
10/29/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: thank u
10/29/17, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: ah nice Daan
10/29/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oehh
10/29/17, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Art 5.8 - 1 from OER :
10/29/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
10/29/17, 12:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Everything that is not accounting to the final grade fall within the scope of "interim" I suppose
10/29/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You suppose
10/29/17, 12:37 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: but you don't have proof of that
10/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: and therefore you'll be in the wrong
10/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well there is no other point aside from interim and final
10/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 5.8 -2 is for final exam
10/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So that needs to cover every grading
10/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I hope you're right
10/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Either I'm right or OER is insufficient
10/29/17, 12:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which would be problematic
10/29/17, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Read 5.8-6
10/29/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nahw :(
10/29/17, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So they are free to deliver it after the exam?
10/29/17, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Seems like it
10/29/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Daan just give us a heads up when Sven replies
10/29/17, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Of course
10/29/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: <Media omitted>
10/29/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Complete with answers
10/29/17, 13:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So what do people think about 8b?
10/29/17, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: advanced recognition, sharing of missing locations in gps
10/29/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yup
10/29/17, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So yes
10/29/17, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Or quickly updating navigation of changed locations
10/29/17, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: yes
10/29/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: greatly reducing the needed on-board computer power as often occurring situations can be pre-decided and shared. potentially decreasing the cost and time to develop this technology
10/29/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I really like this summary, did you finish writing it in full by now, by any chance? I like to read as many summaries as possible, to get the best understanding of the articles :)
10/29/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: same

10/30/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Can you just go to any of the locations they gave in the timetable
10/30/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: Paviljoen J17, L10, U46 or U52
10/30/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alrighty
10/30/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: i think so, can't find anything splitting the group

10/30/17, 12:39 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: When I tried it yesterday they showed up in adobe reader like you would expect them to. Maybe restart adobe reader completely?
10/30/17, 12:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: okay i dont get it anymore, did nothing, now they are listed...
10/30/17, 13:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: The subject names is just "Social robots"?

10/30/17, 15:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Only q5 was hard for me
10/30/17, 15:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Rest was ok
10/30/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: @31648187618 did Sven mail back about the grades?
10/30/17, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: He already posted the reply

10/30/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Lambert antwoordt ook niet
10/30/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Alleen Sven
10/30/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: hij is nu wss al begonnen met nakijken
10/30/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Is ook best wat werk alles zelf nakijken
10/30/17, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Lambert zat volgensmij net in J17 nog essays enzo na te kijken
10/31/17, 13:52 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: 2ID50 book pdf:
https://kakeboksen.td.org.uit.no/Database%20System%20Concepts%206th%20edition.pdf
10/31/17, 13:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Exact same format as operating systems?
10/31/17, 13:57 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Positive
10/31/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Meaning? (Didn't have OS)
10/31/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: meaning that you wont need the book
10/31/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz its 5000000 pages you wont read
10/31/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Awesome
10/31/17, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or 1376 in this case
10/31/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Can confirm, didn't read OS
10/31/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Last year they put almost everything you needed to know in the slides for datamodelling
10/31/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: me neither
10/31/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but you really needed to
10/31/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Best teachers ever
10/31/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz the lecutres are not enough
10/31/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: o waith
10/31/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: they are
10/31/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz they treat everything that might be asked
10/31/17, 13:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: oh well, read the book anyway
10/31/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just start by attending all lectures, we'll see soon enough whether we need it or not
10/31/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: But good to know, that is one book less to consider buying
10/31/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: They want you to pass the course
10/31/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: They explicitely state that multiple times on the canvas page you can already visit
10/31/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
10/31/17, 14:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's a common ground between us and them lol

10/31/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah that's like the plot summary of Pretty Little Liars
10/31/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: ah okay sick
11/1/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No  social robots grade yet? He lied to us
11/1/17, 10:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Who lied
11/1/17, 10:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Probably the guy who told him that the grades would be on today
11/1/17, 10:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And also today is barely beginni g
11/1/17, 10:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Maybe in the afternoon ?
11/1/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You expect him to check all those exams within 2 days?
11/1/17, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Seems unreal to me
11/1/17, 10:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Me neither
11/1/17, 10:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: To be honest i think os will come in a bit earlier than sr
11/1/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: He said he would have them in 1 day
11/1/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No joke
11/1/17, 10:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hahaahahaha
11/1/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You sure you're not talking about the essays?
11/1/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Im sure
11/1/17, 10:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: He said he would stay up all night
11/1/17, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Hmm alright
11/1/17, 10:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Maybe he was being sarcastic
11/1/17, 10:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Trolling students
11/1/17, 10:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And tbh even if he does check them in 1 or 2 days i think the administration will take atleast 1 week before putting them on canvas
11/1/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No he was very very serious😂
11/1/17, 10:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 👌🤣
11/1/17, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: But Sven also has to take a look at them, Lambert didn't know how long that will take haha
11/1/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: <Media omitted>
11/1/17, 11:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Who dat?
11/1/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Social robots teacher
11/1/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Not even checking right now
11/1/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Ask him about the exam haha
11/1/17, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: what are you doing in ehv?
11/1/17, 11:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Stalking him
11/1/17, 11:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: ah, carry on

11/1/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I have been getting this on my pc and mobile
11/1/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Does anyone have this too
11/1/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: It's been more than 4 days
11/1/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: OH DEAR
11/1/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't have that
11/1/17, 11:43 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: It's still working for me
11/1/17, 11:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Works for me too
11/1/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: Hmm I'll go to STU now I guess
11/1/17, 11:44 - ‪+31 6 30851426‬: I cant email them because the mail does not work :(
11/1/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Haha
11/1/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Oops
11/1/17, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Wrong chat sorry
11/1/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
11/1/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: positive natural numbers?
11/1/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: all natural numbers greater than 2? I don't know for sure though
11/1/17, 14:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah either this or all even naturals
11/1/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: thats what I thought
11/1/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Natural numbers are positive by default :p
11/1/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or all natural numbers with more than one digit?
11/1/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Nope, some say 0 is a natural number
11/1/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah so not negative
11/1/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: N+ means all naturals above 0
11/1/17, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So N+2
11/1/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Not negative != Positive
11/1/17, 14:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But the regular + already means positive
11/1/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: so +2 meaning the same wouldn't make sense :p
11/1/17, 14:21 - Reinier Schmiermann: Looking at the statement, I would say it is all natural numbers that are at least 2
11/1/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Gonna guess using this one haha. Thanks all!
11/1/17, 14:25 - Bas Gieling: depends where you are, in some countries 0 is said to be both positive and negative and in others it is said to be neither
11/1/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Could it be "all natural numbers starting from 1", squared?
11/1/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I should not have said that in a chat full of computer scientists
11/1/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah Cas thanks for giving another option 😂
11/1/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: would choose for cass solution
11/1/17, 14:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No because that would need the 2 to be even higher in the text
11/1/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: but that would be better expressed all n elemof N for which n^2 elemof N
11/1/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: The 2 and the + are not perfectly aligned haha, think you interpret them as two independent symbols
11/1/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No it seems to be all natural numbers starting at 2
11/1/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: proof: @31630168397  said so
11/1/17, 14:27 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: The 2 is slightly higher
11/1/17, 14:27 - Bas Gieling: i would usually say its a vector of 2 components which are both greater than 0
11/1/17, 14:27 - Reinier Schmiermann: It does not hold for 1, so it cannot be squares of positive natural numbers
11/1/17, 14:28 - Bas Gieling: but
11/1/17, 14:28 - Bas Gieling: doesnt really fit in the rest of the statement
11/1/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: might just be latex antics
11/1/17, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Alright! 👌🏻

11/2/17, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Looking ahead to next quartile: this is the book for databases you'll all need
11/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: luv
11/2/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: thats kinda a repost, but still luv
11/2/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: o rly?
11/2/17, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thought so as well
11/2/17, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: Individual and group assignments for Social Robots are up!
11/2/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not here
11/2/17, 12:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Doesnt see to be up for me
11/2/17, 12:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Seem*
11/2/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: for me they are
11/2/17, 12:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31621372984 you are not alone
11/2/17, 12:00 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I was in Nyholms group
11/2/17, 12:00 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Sven?
11/2/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: yea same guy
11/2/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: sven nyholm
11/2/17, 12:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Strange i was in it too but i got nothing yet
11/2/17, 12:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Eric you got it ?
11/2/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: I have mine
11/2/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: maybe they are still uploading the grades?
11/2/17, 12:01 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: idk
11/2/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: From sven
11/2/17, 12:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I guess they are putting them now ? 😐
11/2/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Im in lambers groep rip
11/2/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: just wait 10 min maximum, and the should be up I think
11/2/17, 12:02 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: You mean essay and portfolio?
11/2/17, 12:02 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yes
11/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: <Media omitted>
11/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: its on ositis not canvas
11/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: those are the individual and group assignments
11/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Aaah
11/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: theyre on osiris
11/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i see
11/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Let me check that then
11/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: :|
11/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: 7.5 for both
11/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: Lmao
11/2/17, 12:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: olé
11/2/17, 12:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 7 for both
11/2/17, 12:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I was so close yet so far away from Maxu senpai
11/2/17, 12:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Wait a sec
11/2/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: wtf i got a 6.5 for my essay
11/2/17, 12:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: i didnt even try to be convincing lmao
11/2/17, 12:08 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: How much do you have for portfolio ?
11/2/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 8
11/2/17, 12:09 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: already knew that tho
11/2/17, 12:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Eh they you are fine
11/2/17, 12:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think most people i know of so far they have grades that avrage at around 7 every time. 🐢 i smell a conspiracy theory
11/2/17, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: 😱 what does @31642007885 have to do with this?
11/2/17, 12:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh shit i was just using emoji 🦆
11/2/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Anyone knows javascript well?
11/2/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I am trying to parse a csv a file and then store it as an array
11/2/17, 13:16 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: var csv = require("fast-csv");
var myArray = [];

csv
 .fromPath(csvPath, {headers: true})
 .on("data", data => {
        myArray.push(data);
        console.log(myArray)
 })
 .on("end", function(){
     console.log("done");
 });

console.log(myArray)
11/2/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Here the first console.log(myArray) works correctly, while the second one doesnt
11/2/17, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I havent been able to figure out how to store myArray out of the scope of the function
11/2/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: That is because that fromPath function is asynchronous
11/2/17, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: By using .on you are telling the program to do something after it has completed the task
11/2/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: But the code just continues before the task has finished
11/2/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: So your second log probably runs first, when the function is not completed yet, hence your array is empty
11/2/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
11/2/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it literally is explained in the introduction of ch. 7 lol
11/2/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ This video might help you out with what Nimo just explained
11/2/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: As in understand what is going on
11/2/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Thanks guys, I am now calling the functions directly from the on.(end part and it works properly
11/2/17, 14:45 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I'll make sure to watch that video since the I find the whole asynchronous part of Javascript very confusing
11/2/17, 14:46 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Well that's a pretty big part of js :D
11/2/17, 14:47 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: The easiest way is to just continue in the .on but if you wanna look further, take a look at promises and async/await
11/2/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I had so much trouble with promises lol
11/2/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Yeah I plan to do more functions with the parsed data, so I can see how putting everything on  .on is not the best practice
11/2/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: But some guy on stack overflow pointed me to this vid and it much of it became much clearer
11/2/17, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: But it does help as quick workaround till I start getting it
11/2/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Yeah promises can get messy
11/2/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Async/await seems like a way more intuitive way to use them
11/2/17, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: What about pipe
11/2/17, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: That is like a different workaround or something different?
11/2/17, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: It's kinda different
11/2/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I think you can see it as sort of a shortcut that combines the .on and the part where you do something with the data you got
11/2/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Man, try connecting to mongodb with nodejs without using mongoose
11/2/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: That's the plan later on
11/2/17, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: The fucking promises to get data or put it in the database
11/2/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Do you think it is a better approach to set up mongodb before building the library function?
11/2/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I was planning to build the logic with an array first and then switch it to mongodb
11/2/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Might be
11/2/17, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: And you will get more experience with promises 😜
11/2/17, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: But i was using the mean stack, might help you out or not 🙈
11/2/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Yeah mean stack is the goal
11/2/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: It is just a bit overwhelming to learn everything at once
11/2/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Yeah, i understand
11/2/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: There was an article, i believe on coursera that talks about setting up your mean stack
11/2/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Thats what i did
11/2/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: But i already had experience with angular, nodejs and express
11/2/17, 15:05 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Yeah I have some resources as well, I guess I just need to go slowly through everything
11/2/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For which course was that "alain cheat sheet" again?
11/2/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm currently creating folders for the new courses
11/2/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I believe data structures
11/2/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or whatever the subject is called
11/2/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 2ID50
11/2/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 2ID60?
11/2/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Web Technology
11/2/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or datamodelling and databases
11/2/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh nvm
11/2/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is 2ID50 lol
11/2/17, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thank you

11/9/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Like a week ago
11/9/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31642007885  do we have chats already for information security basics (2AC10) and Rational Agents (0LSUE0) ?
11/9/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: we got an envelop in the first week from our tutor
11/9/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: computer graphics anyone?
11/9/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait what..?
I got nothing so far
11/9/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: How did you get an envelope if they were going to send it digitally
11/9/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: im 95% certain our tutor give us a physical envelope with 70 euros
11/9/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but i might be mistaken so let me ask
11/9/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: our tutor said they'd send it digitally
11/9/17, 14:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Digital
11/9/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: The envelope was a form i think
11/9/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: A form you fill to get the money digitaly later
11/9/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Fill your iban and shit
11/9/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thats what i think
11/9/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: we had to print that one by ourselves
11/9/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: at least our tutor let us print that out by ourselves
11/9/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: thast true we had to do that as well
11/9/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: im confused
11/9/17, 14:43 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Might be wrong so dont fully trust me but it defo wasnt money
11/9/17, 14:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: They do it digital in order to pay exact amount
11/9/17, 14:44 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: our tutor said it might be till febuary till you got it back
11/9/17, 14:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: If you did t spend 70  and only used 57 in your bills report part then they give you 57 i think
11/9/17, 14:44 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Stingy tue

11/12/17, 19:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Email says 10:45
11/12/17, 19:22 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Flux 1.02
11/12/17, 19:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: aight
11/12/17, 22:00 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Does anyone know if the first meeting for DBL algorithms is actualy only upcomming friday? Because thats what my schedule says
11/12/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what? really?
11/12/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so, what
11/12/17, 22:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: were just free on wednesday?
11/12/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Nice
11/12/17, 22:45 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Well last quartile my schedule ob wednesday was also empty but that wasnt realy the case. And since i dont seem to have a canvas page for DBL algorithms i would have no clue where to go if we have something on wednesday
11/12/17, 23:03 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Yeah there is a good chance mytimetable is just bugged again
11/12/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i mean
11/12/17, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how would we know
11/12/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Like the lecturers give a shit about one of the TUE systems not working properly... pretty sure they will just continue their lectures like nothing happened. If not they would have to fit 7 weeks of material in 6.5 which will probably be shitty as well so lets just hope theres no lecture on wednesday cause else you'll just be fucked
11/12/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Iirc DBL Algo had its first "lecture" was on friday, and after that you just plan woth your group when to meet and stuff
11/12/17, 23:11 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Friday probably is only explaining what problem youll have to solve and which group you are in, and how the course is structured
11/13/17, 00:04 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Fit 7 weeks in 7,5 *
The backup week exists for this very reason
11/13/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: But just send an email to Herman Haverkort
11/13/17, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: He will be able to tell you probably
11/13/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: are the rational agents instruction groups known yet?
11/13/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah
11/13/17, 09:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: There is explained what people are in which groups somewhere

11/14/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: The course dependency graph someone made two years back tells me that Software Engineering has it as a prerequisite
11/14/17, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: sounds like a useful graph to post here *hint*
11/14/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so stupid why doesnt whatsapp require two asterixes on each side in order to make something bold
11/14/17, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Alright thanks !

11/14/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Woops
11/14/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I planned those wrongly then

11/14/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: That's exactly why I asked
11/14/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hmm
11/14/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
11/14/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Think of it as: hey that is hoe you should plan it
Not as: you need this before starting the course
11/14/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: @31648187618 , is that software spec ?
11/14/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh no we are safe Tom
11/14/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I read the 2IPD0 osiris page
11/14/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is considered prior knowledge but is in no way mandatory
11/14/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So we just gotta try a bit harder probably
11/14/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should be fine
11/14/17, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And then 2IPC0 is gonna be a breeze
11/14/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah I just asked someone who already did both courses
11/14/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And she said it was np
11/14/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Great
11/14/17, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: It's fine
11/14/17, 20:44 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Is there a group chat for intro to cryptology?
11/14/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: I don't think so
11/14/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: 2AC10?
11/14/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I think its not the same course
11/14/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 2AC10 is information security in society
11/14/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: but 2AC10 is also an introduction to crypto which has me confused
11/14/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Yes
11/14/17, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: But it has cryptology stuff too
11/14/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Intro to crypto is something else
11/14/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But it is not the course introduction to cryptology :p
11/14/17, 21:07 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Is part of the security package
11/14/17, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wow
11/15/17, 08:47 - ‪+31 6 46487242‬: Is there a whatsapp group for automata this quartile?
11/15/17, 08:53 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: if so count me in xd, failed it too
11/15/17, 08:54 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: We have set up an discord server with a few first year students and they have implemented some very nice things. We have a server for each faculty and all the subjects in that faculty. You can join a subject with a simple command and o my then you will see the channel appear in your list. There is a no-spam channel, off-topic and a few others. 

Mathematics & Computer Science: https://discord.gg/NWcUyFV

If you join everything I’d explained in the info channel

11/15/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: What was the e-mail to that ESA helpdesk roel bloo talked about yesterday again?
11/15/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: One of my courses say I have reached my maximum amount of registrations for that course
11/15/17, 11:04 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Even though I am not registered at all...
11/15/17, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL

11/15/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So yes that is probably what they did
11/15/17, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Mail Bloo about it just to bug him
11/15/17, 11:19 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: how long untill the conformation mails again?

11/15/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: r u a gangster
11/15/17, 15:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: then I think the final grade will be today as well
11/15/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I hope so
11/15/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: would make sense, considering the tutors already had our indidivual grades when we ended the project
11/15/17, 15:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: they just had to give them to the examiner
11/15/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: how fair are these grades
11/15/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I expected even higher to be honest
11/15/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: I fucking did everything
11/15/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: same
11/15/17, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: And got a 6
11/15/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But my HWA's were not always multiple pages and 1500+ words
11/15/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: considering people who fucked up the entire shit get the highest grades
11/15/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Yeah
11/15/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: So that's where your OS time went
11/15/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: HWA's were really important yeah
11/15/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Kinda
11/15/17, 15:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The tutor stressed out that HWA + meeting participation were by far the most important for you individual grade and the essay by far the most important for the remainder
11/15/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: The guy of our group who did the least and wrote the most elaborated in HWAs got the highest grade, even though I addressed this to the tutor
11/15/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But if you did a lot and did not write an extensive HWA with a lot of pictures then the tutor has 0 evidence you worked hard
11/15/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is why the tutors stressed out from meeting 1 that you should definitely write a lot of bullshit in your HWA's
11/15/17, 15:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Thought about the course while taking a dump? write it down
11/15/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: lol
11/15/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: seriously even though I did a lot on average, there was one week I did a bit less and just repeated bullshit and thoughts in other words
11/15/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And the tutor told me he really liked my HWA that week
11/15/17, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: What grade did you get?
11/15/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 8.0
11/15/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Nice
11/15/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: n'ice
11/15/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I often had HWA's of 1500-2000+ words and 10+ pictures :p
11/15/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not sure about yours?
11/15/17, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: 3 sentences and pictures, the building already cost a lot of time, but still got a 7 though
11/15/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well in that case congrats haha
11/15/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: My tutor did not accept one page HWA's, even if the work itself was a lot
11/15/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: The tutors had to stress that
11/15/17, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You could've seen it yourself in the rubric as well
11/15/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: actual work meant nothing to your grade
11/15/17, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: only the bullshit you wrote down added points
11/15/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: A few sentences for my hwa's, forgot to hand in  hwa, didn't do more than the others in my group, got an 8
11/15/17, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
11/15/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is highly tutor-dependent then
11/15/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I was 1 of the 2 people talking during our meetings
11/15/17, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ahh that makes a difference
11/15/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: what other grade did we need again from ED? I thought the individual thing was the last thing they had to grade
11/15/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: report and driving around that day
11/15/17, 15:46 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: so basically if your report is a 6.5 there is not worry in any other field
11/15/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: If you were present at meetings and stuff en your tutor thinks you helped a bit. You should have passed the course if the report is decent.
11/15/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes
11/15/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and for the report we had the exact rubric
11/15/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: a guy that cant make sentences got  8 so i guess doesnt really matter how much u contribute in the meetings. but seems like every tutor has different way of grading
11/15/17, 15:48 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Last year 1998 out of 2000 students passed the course
11/15/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: I was born in 1998
11/15/17, 15:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok but still if i got 6.5 on presentation and 8 on both individual assisnments i dont have to worry that much right ?
11/15/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: just a little bit
11/15/17, 15:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Presentation + individual assignments count for a total of 50
11/15/17, 15:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: %
11/15/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No only if you think you are among 2/2000 you should be worried :p
11/15/17, 15:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ay man its still a terrifying chance 🦆
11/15/17, 15:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐗🔫pls no kill piglet
11/15/17, 15:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Also i think tue staff has legit the most autistic work methods?!
11/15/17, 15:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Whats up with publishing one grade and not the whole thing
11/15/17, 15:58 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: It takes more time to go through all students twice and put 1 grade each time than to go through 1 time and put everything
11/15/17, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah but this way they can write more hours and more easy work
11/15/17, 15:59 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Then again the administration in mf consists of 2  ladies that look 55+ a guy thats 60 atleast and a 3rd year bach student
11/15/17, 16:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So i imagine they have the combined speed of a snail
11/15/17, 16:01 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Anyway tue strikes again
11/15/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Lol one of the two that didn't pass the course was in my group, he missed 3 meetings so had to retake the course
11/15/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Are they seriously going to let us wait for the rest of the grades until tomorrow :p..
11/15/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: So we can safely assume that the people who didn't pass, didn't pass solely because of that fact?
11/15/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering office hours are done now
11/15/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sort of
11/15/17, 16:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Tep no more grades today
11/15/17, 16:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐧👌🏻
11/15/17, 16:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thanks tue
11/15/17, 16:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐧🖕🏻
11/15/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Does someone know where I can find the Q4 resit dates? I can only find the schedule of last year.
11/15/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: In what week they’re given of also the specific date for each subject?
11/15/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: <Media omitted>
11/15/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
11/15/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: The specific dates
11/15/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ah you mean specific for the course?
11/15/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Yeah, if those are out there I'd love to know them
11/15/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Cuz I don’t think they know that already
11/15/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not sure tho, i remember looking that up way in advance last year
11/15/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lemme check if I can find something
11/15/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: Yes, since Q4 registration is now open I thought maybe they have it already. Would like to know regarding holiday. Thanks for checking!
11/15/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nope sorry can’t find it
11/15/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Really don’t know what I looked for last year tbh
11/15/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Maybe ask it at STU if you can’t find it anywhere online
11/15/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah chances are they have it
11/15/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not sure if it’s definitive, but from last year I remember very little change
11/15/17, 21:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ahh I think I realise why we only received the individual grades for ED
11/15/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The Tuesday we had our final (evaluation) meeting was today three weeks and one day in the past
11/15/17, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Meaning they were already 1 day overdue with the grade
11/15/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So being too late with the individual grades for the 15 work day rule probably means they are gonna stretch the 15 work days for the final report to its fullest extend
11/15/17, 21:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The final report deadline being a Saturday 28th of october means they have until this friday evening 23:59
11/15/17, 22:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thats some news
11/15/17, 22:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: They are good and bad
11/15/17, 22:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But eh
11/15/17, 22:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐧👌🏻
11/16/17, 16:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: i guess no grades today either
11/16/17, 16:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: @31648187618
11/16/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nope, deadline is tomorrow
11/16/17, 16:39 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: they will stretch it hard :D

11/16/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well that is new
11/16/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: New plan
11/16/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: there is no plan
11/16/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Oh, it's fine after I refreshed a few times. Sure
11/16/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Its the new planapp
11/16/17, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: They reduced it so there won’t be any errors
11/16/17, 19:32 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: The Best plan
11/16/17, 19:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Cant get your planning dissaproved if you have no planning👌🏻

11/17/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Still no final ED grades, will they do it in time or not? Place your bets noe!
11/17/17, 14:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Probably not
11/17/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If they don't do it today I'm gonna bitch about it for sure :D
11/17/17, 14:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Not todayyy
11/17/17, 14:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Admin is until 16.30
11/17/17, 14:56 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So we fucko
11/17/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hm?
11/17/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No they have until 23:59 to let us know the grades one way or another
11/17/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If the administration does not release them in time they should send us the grades in a different way
11/17/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'll send them a mail when I get home
11/17/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
11/17/17, 17:07 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Seems nice 👌🏼
11/17/17, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: sent
11/17/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Daan, they are completely in their right
11/17/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I just realized
11/17/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Really
11/17/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I just read through the OER thingy
11/17/17, 17:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It does state the 15 business days quite a lot
11/17/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is a practical assignment, and the OER allows 4 months for checking practical work iirc
11/17/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: NO WAY
11/17/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Dude.. 4 months
11/17/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Sorry, weeks :p
11/17/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Hahaha 4 months😂
11/17/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
11/17/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do you have the part of the OER that says that or shall I look again
11/17/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I believe you but I'm curious
11/17/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I'd advise looking it up again, as I don't know the entire OER by heart ;(
11/17/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
11/17/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: in whole article 5.8 there is no mention of 4 weeks
11/17/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I only see the 15 work days repeated a lot
11/17/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: This part
11/17/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: that is exactly the part I sent just now
11/17/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: this
11/17/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no later than 15 working days after the deadline is what it says there
11/17/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it says one paragraph below (5.8-7) that if an examiner cannot meet the deadline for whatever reason possible, the students involved will immediately informed by the examinations committee. 
Considering this has not happened, the 15 working days still applies
11/17/17, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you can prove me wrong with that part of the OER please do so 😂
11/17/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: If you read even more carefully, it states practical assignment as a study component.. does that clause then apply to that examination?
11/17/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: In b4 a reply time of 6 generations
11/17/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In the paragraph this is the closest thing to a practical assignment that is covered
11/17/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And this is the section that applies to grading times
11/17/17, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Should be there somewhere
11/17/17, 22:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31642623926  did you manage to find in writing yet whether they have an extra week or not?
11/17/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Still no grades
11/17/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Not yet
11/17/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I did not find it in that section or after it
11/17/17, 22:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also: you might also take a look at the werktuigbouw-OER, as the subject is from the fietsenmaker
11/17/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: OER is TU-wide afaik
11/17/17, 22:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or not
11/17/17, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: It has been 15 workdays now, so maybe they'll put it online tomorrow or monday, though tomorrow seems highly unlikely
11/17/17, 22:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its kinda sad that every quartile we seek justice and reason about the grades and even time it stays the same
11/17/17, 22:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: They are shit
11/17/17, 22:38 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thats the whole story
11/17/17, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Every program has their own OER, which is however based on a tu-wide model
11/18/17, 02:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will look into that later, thanks Rick
11/18/17, 02:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Well, only way to let 'em know is by grading the course which is sadly already done 😓

11/20/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: WTF
11/20/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: What kind of response is this
11/20/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This reaction took them 3 days
11/20/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: that's tilting even me lmao
11/20/17, 14:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I wrote a whole goddamn email
11/20/17, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: reply back saying they are cocksucking gaylords
11/20/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: just reply back: "Dear ED Team,"
11/20/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: "Dear ED Team,
When?
Kind regards"
11/20/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
11/20/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Maybe you'll get a higher grade then?
11/20/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Yeah seriously please do that
11/20/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Kinda tempted to ask whether we get bonus points for every day they should't started earlier
11/20/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: This
11/20/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: soon™
11/20/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will do that if we don't have them tonight Niels
11/20/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Kind regards, a lot of annoyed students

11/20/17, 16:56 - Luke Houben: GG
11/20/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This is straight up strontirritant. There would have been no issue at all if someone would have just sent us an email last week with something like "yeah guys listen we're sorry we know you're waiting and we're trying to deliver proper work"
11/20/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But they did not even take the effort to write a 2 minute email
11/20/17, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: nice
11/20/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: send it now
11/20/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its dark
11/20/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so it feels like night
11/20/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: what is their email address btw
11/20/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i'll send a mail as well
11/20/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 4wbb0@tue.nl
11/20/17, 19:09 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I don't think we'll be seeing the grades tonight, or do we?
11/20/17, 19:10 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: seeing how it's after office hours
11/20/17, 19:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: If you dont see anything by 16:30 then its not that day most probably
11/20/17, 19:20 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I expect them tomorrow
11/20/17, 19:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I expected them last week
11/20/17, 19:21 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐧🤞🏻
11/20/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The course guys are supposed to notify us of the grades regardless of whether the administration has entered them into Osiris
11/20/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering they had to do this no later than last friday, I reason it still holds
11/20/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So they could send an Excel file tonight as well
11/20/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In theory
11/20/17, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or let the tutors mail their groups

11/20/17, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: damn daan
11/20/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Welke faculteit is het eigenlijk
11/20/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Werktuigbouw dus
11/20/17, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ahh 😂

11/21/17, 09:25 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Stuur terug:
11/21/17, 09:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Isn't it the responsibility of the teacher to send an excel file or something if administration fails?
11/21/17, 09:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Lieve incapabele fietsenmakers van ED,

Hier is een simpel stappenplan
1. Pak je excel-sheet met cijfers
2. Pleur ze op canvas
3. Laat je ouders abortus plegen met terugwerkende kracht

Vriendelijke groeten,
Daan Waalboer

11/21/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Kan je dat zwart op wit terugvinden?
11/21/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: doe het
11/21/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: maar lees wel je mail na
11/21/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Word een beetje moe van die mensen
11/21/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: want er staat wat wazigs in
11/21/17, 09:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Zie het :p
11/21/17, 09:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: OER 5.8.6 Daan
11/21/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ze dienen het punt uiterlijk 15 dagen na de deadline vast te stellen en mede te delen aan de student
11/21/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Daarom
11/21/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Heeft niks met de administratie te maken
11/21/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nope
11/21/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nou, het is nog mooier
11/21/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Vertel aub Rick
11/21/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Het is via het daarvoor bedoelde systeem
11/21/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ja true
11/21/17, 09:29 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Dus ze moeten het via OSIRIS doen, 15 dagen na de deadline
11/21/17, 09:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: En ze zijn dus nu aan het zeuren dat de excel-sheets van de docenten niet compatible zijn, maar de gemiddelde geestelijk beperkte hackt binnen 15 minuten een pythonscriptje in elkaar om dat te fixen
11/21/17, 09:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Top dan quote ik de OER effe in m'n mailtje
11/21/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: pretty funny how they first said "soon" but now they're stating that "it's out of [their] hands"
11/21/17, 09:35 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: how can they even know that the grades release soon when its out of their hands (assuming that both statements are not a lie)

11/21/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31642623926  we hebben verder geen dingen met fietsenmakers meer he?
11/21/17, 09:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sent 👍🏻
11/21/17, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: dit is echt fucking schandalig holy shit

11/21/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You already subscribed for it for the coming quartiles probably
11/21/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Happened to me too
11/21/17, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Had a bunch of stuff in there that shouldn't be in there atm
11/21/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: yeah, I signed up for 3rd and 4th quartile
11/21/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but it wasn't on my schedule yesterday, and now it suddenly is
11/21/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: my mail even says I signed up for the DBL of the 4th quartile
11/21/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah that's all correct
11/21/17, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's just planapp acting funky
11/21/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Just uncheck it
11/21/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Fixed
11/21/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They're probably only checking if you're signed up for a course and if that's the case they'll show it to your timetable. As Nick says just uncheck and be done with it
11/21/17, 14:43 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: true, but I was just wondering why it suddenly showed
11/21/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Os is online
11/21/17, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: welcome to the party slowpoke

11/21/17, 17:36 - Luke Houben: I guess no response either from those douches
11/21/17, 17:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think so
11/21/17, 17:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ask daan or stef
11/21/17, 17:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: They were doing the correspondence
11/21/17, 17:37 - Luke Houben: That's why I ask here :p
11/21/17, 17:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And sadly i dont think it will be today either
11/21/17, 17:37 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐧🤞🏻

11/22/17, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Gonna write the administration a mail whose responsibility it is. Course or admin
11/22/17, 13:53 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Algo instruction is useless

11/22/17, 14:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: stuur ook naar examencomissie?
11/22/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: is dat ESA of niet
11/22/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Doe
11/22/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Daan, je kunt beter gewoon even mailtje naar Luuk sturen
11/22/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jammer genoeg weet ik dat je gelijk hebt
11/22/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hij heeft veel meer leverage
11/22/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nee ESA is student administratie
11/22/17, 14:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ik zal 't Luuk wel even vragen
11/22/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Heb Luuk braaf gemaild voor het beste plan van aanpak

11/22/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You can use the star system for that
11/22/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You go to the left menu -> courses -> all courses and then only select the starts in front of the courses youd like to see
11/22/17, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: i know now :P

11/23/17, 09:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah but thats because ur a florian
11/23/17, 09:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: florians and jaaps arent compatible, thats common knowledge
11/23/17, 09:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: oh crap, this isnt the spam chat 😅

11/23/17, 09:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: they were quite useful even if you were someone who kept up with the homework ex.
11/23/17, 09:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz they were basically discussing the hardest ones
11/23/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: We had homework?

11/23/17, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Loosely translated of course
11/23/17, 10:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Meh I could see Luuk saying that in person
11/23/17, 16:32 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Discrete grades are up, if anyone noticed
11/23/17, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: OMG
11/23/17, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Good call out

11/23/17, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: What is the difference between NVD and NV again?
11/23/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Niet voldaan, niet verschenen?
11/23/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: WTF but I was there 😅
11/23/17, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: You got a NV?
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It’s kinda random what they use I think
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: That moment you get a 5.2 but need a 5.8 due to intermediates
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Yeah I did
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: No grade at all
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Wtf
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: That's random Nimo
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Wew
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 25164039‬: Same had 5,4 but needed a 5,9
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Send an email
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Sucks
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Yeah, this will be fun
11/23/17, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Or go to the office of Zantema
11/23/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: That's probably faster
11/23/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Thanks
11/23/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Send an email to ESA, osiris helpdesk and Zantema immediately
11/23/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Metaforum, room 6.078
11/23/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or go to his office if you're on campus anyway
11/23/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Do all
11/23/17, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Most chance of success
11/23/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: There is no pdf with all the interim grades right?
11/23/17, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: nope just the average on osiris AFAIK
11/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Anyone knows what your log in username is for osiris?
11/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: S number
11/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: snumber
11/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: They probably have it, but haven't shared it with us
11/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Hmm is there any way to get them
11/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: It says that yoyr s number isnt the log in😪
11/23/17, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Just mail zantema or my tutor?
11/23/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: TUE\s-number
11/23/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Can try both
11/23/17, 17:05 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: okay thanks
11/23/17, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
11/23/17, 17:19 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Its always s number
11/23/17, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Nee dimi
11/24/17, 09:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: boys and girls
11/24/17, 09:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: for people with DBLgorithms: how the fuck do we hand in the first prototype
11/24/17, 09:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we have 3 classes, all in different java files
11/24/17, 09:45 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk what to hand in
11/24/17, 09:51 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyone?
11/24/17, 09:52 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: am i the only one taking dbl algorithms or what?
11/24/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: only 3 java files?
11/24/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Yes
11/24/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: we had at least 6 or so
11/24/17, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I would say make a zip and hand that in
11/24/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But the programming peeps last year found that a really difficult concept
11/24/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: I believe we handed all java files in
11/24/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: good for you we dont
11/24/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no, it only takes java files
11/24/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how does momotor know what to run then?
11/24/17, 09:55 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what is your main file called?
11/24/17, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: our main file was written by a fellow student
11/24/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what?
11/24/17, 09:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what do you mean "a fellow student"
11/24/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: The main file is the only file with a main method.
11/24/17, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Momotor will recognize this by itself. Just hand in all the seperate java files
11/24/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we did
11/24/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
11/24/17, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: we get this
11/24/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
11/24/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this is our first output line
11/24/17, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what is the problem?
11/24/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I don't know anything about the exercise etc but is it possible that you make 1 file that runs all other three fiels?
11/24/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: files*
11/24/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Or at least utelizes those other files?
11/24/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it doesnt matter
11/24/17, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: momotor compiles the file just fine
11/24/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: but somehow it says our first line of output is wrong
11/24/17, 10:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: why?
11/24/17, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Maybe because of errors in the momotor package, or just that your output is wrong
11/24/17, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: I don't know if this is spam, but I found this critical information: frikandellenbroodje + can of red bull for only 1€ at the spar atm
11/24/17, 12:59 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Black friday sales at the spar?
11/24/17, 13:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't think there is anything more related to studying than this, solid info
11/24/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I got it yesterday, but I didn't like the red bull, so I gave it away
11/24/17, 13:03 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: good deal, especially since the frikandelbroodje was warm
11/24/17, 13:06 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what are we, MBOers?
11/24/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: frikadellenbroodje en red bull
11/24/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: damn
11/24/17, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's good though
11/24/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: If I'm an MBOer if I enjoy that, than call me an MBOer
11/24/17, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I’ll allow it
11/24/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: What have we become
11/24/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: This however is obsolete information
11/24/17, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And this
11/24/17, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Helmond is obsolete
11/24/17, 13:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Daan rij met je motor tegen een boom alsjeblieft
11/24/17, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂😂
11/24/17, 22:13 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Discrete results are online
11/24/17, 22:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Wauw Dante
11/24/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: For a day already
11/24/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Die staan er echt al 3 dagen op ofzo
11/24/17, 22:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: What he said
11/24/17, 22:18 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Oke sorry ik kom er net pas achter
11/24/17, 22:23 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🐢thanks dante
11/25/17, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hey guys Luuk asked me to post this here:

The 7th of december there are kringgesprekken again, if you're not familiar with the concept: you sit down with the teachers during lunch to discuss what can be improved about the lectures (ofcoarse also mention the thing that are going well). You'll get a nice lunch and hopefully better lectures afterwards. If you're interested please mail co@gewis.nl and mention that you're interested in joining + the courses you're currently following. This way everything can be aranged.

Also for the people following databases. They're interested in our opinion about the livestreams because this is a first time for the TUe. So if you're willing to give feedback about that during this quartile please send mail to co@gewis.nl as well.
11/25/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: the livestream is amazing
11/25/17, 15:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: allready "aangemeld"
11/25/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Completely agree! But they're looking for feedback to see if they can improve
11/25/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 1. Have both parts of the lecture in a single location instead of having to swap to another one after the first 45 mins
11/25/17, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: From the one hand it's awesome of course, but how weird would it be if a lecturer is teaching to nothing but a videocamera?
11/25/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i mean you already notice that its hard to keep up with questions that are asked in the chat now
11/25/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: let alone if no one comes to lectures anymore
11/25/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: so idk how they wanna improve that
11/25/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but that could be a thing
11/25/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I don't think no one will show up tbvh
11/25/17, 15:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no me neither, but you allready noticed during the last lecture that questions remained unanswered
11/25/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Higher bitrate, just higher quality in general
11/25/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hmm i think the vid quality wasnt bad?
11/25/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Not sure if it's possible already, but independently resize both sections
11/25/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i mean i could read what he was writing on the blackboard
11/25/17, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Not bad bad, but it can be always be improved
11/25/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: can always be *
11/25/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: but that's not really something course related
11/25/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: but just more in general
11/25/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They're looking for general feedback for the livestreams
11/25/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Ah alright
11/25/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Course related stuff can be mentioned during the kringgesprek
11/25/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: then that is definitely something that could be considered
11/25/17, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I agree that some things were sometimes difficult to read
11/26/17, 14:05 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: <Media omitted>
11/26/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Sorry for that
11/26/17, 14:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: no lik elegit ?
11/26/17, 14:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: like legit wtf
11/26/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Three significant numbers so should be 627*10^2
11/26/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: nee dimi
11/26/17, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If that is the correct answer
11/26/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Spam
11/26/17, 14:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Soo 627e2?
11/26/17, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Yes
11/26/17, 14:10 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Nope
11/26/17, 14:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And the answer should be 62696 drops by my calculations
11/26/17, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: What did you do?
11/26/17, 14:12 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 4/3*pi* 0.1^3 is volume of drop in cm3
11/26/17, 14:12 - ‪+421 915 519 988‬: volume of the bottle / volume of the drop? dunno, but got this
11/26/17, 14:12 - ‪+421 915 519 988‬: <Media omitted>
11/26/17, 14:13 - ‪+421 915 519 988‬: ok nvm google calc failed me :D
11/26/17, 14:13 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So one drop is 0.0319
11/26/17, 14:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 2000/0.0319 is 62696
11/26/17, 14:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So wtf am i doing wrong ?
11/26/17, 14:14 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 10th time trying to solve it and its always giving me wrong
11/26/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: 4/3 * pi*0.1^3 gives me 0.004
11/26/17, 14:15 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: And thats is mm^3
11/26/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: So you are atleast a factor 1000 off
11/26/17, 14:17 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: kek
11/26/17, 14:17 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh yeah measurements

11/27/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 44420671‬: Not really
11/27/17, 16:44 - ‪+31 6 44420671‬: They didnt say anything about the location
11/27/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Did yorick email you guys confirming that the meeting was today at 17:40 without the location?
11/27/17, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: Yep

11/27/17, 22:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I mean what is the way they raise attention and such
11/27/17, 22:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just online without some video does not sound like something that draws a lot of people
11/27/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Do you mean ours or the actual dance4life organisation?
11/27/17, 22:04 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Guys not trying to sound insensitive but this in not really a topic for this chat. One message is fine and a link.

11/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Wait is the report 50%?
11/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Wtf only a 7.5
11/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
11/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 6.1
11/28/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: worth it
11/28/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's what I get for constantly nagging them
11/28/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I think they listed report as the average of report + final design thingies
11/28/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yes they did
11/28/17, 14:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Are we sure about it ?
11/28/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: that totals to 90%
11/28/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: whats the remainder then
11/28/17, 14:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Maybe its just the report ?
11/28/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: We have 100%?
11/28/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: wait no nevermind
11/28/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: it is 100
11/28/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I got 100% Dobim
11/28/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: lol
11/28/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: no 50% report 35% individual grade 5% individual grade 10% presentation
11/28/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: retard
11/28/17, 14:04 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So is that the report grade or the total grade ?
11/28/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes
11/28/17, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: LOL
11/28/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Can always count on Rick for those questions
11/28/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Alright thank you :)
11/28/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: all grades that have a "weging" next to them are not final grades Dimi
11/28/17, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If there is no percentage weight next to it it is your final grade
11/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So we still dont have total grade ?
11/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Just the report
11/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You can calculate it now
11/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: no but considering all grades are up you have a final grade
11/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You just need a calculator or a brain
11/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Yeah i mean technicly
11/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I already did
11/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hahaha
11/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Just asking
11/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No this is normal for Osiris
11/28/17, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The final grade gets determined by the system I think
11/28/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: so if everything is in there up to 100% then the system calculates your final grade
11/28/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and checks everything in your database account and such
11/28/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Probably
11/28/17, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 31763035‬: You can find the final course grade under 'progress'
11/28/17, 14:12 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Does anyone know the resit date of discreet structures?
11/30/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: guys
11/30/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Can someone tell the guy to switch his mic back on
11/30/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: For what subject Daan?
11/30/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: nevermind it worked
11/30/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Datamodeling haha
11/30/17, 11:55 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Ah alright
12/1/17, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Hey guys! For the people following databases. They're interested in our opinion about the livestreams because this is a first time for the TUe. So if you're willing to give feedback about that during this quartile please send mail to co@gewis.nl so that you can be added to a list.

12/1/17, 15:51 - ‪+31 6 34184455‬: Does anyone know what to do in IntelliJ when you get the error: "Error: java: invalid flag: -release"?
12/1/17, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: remove the flag "-release"?
12/1/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 34184455‬: Not really what is meant by the error. Solved it by reinstalling the latest version.
12/1/17, 16:49 - Casper Smits: Probably had to do with the build settings. But luckily it is fixed now :)
12/2/17, 11:50 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: If A->B then AY->B has to hold aswell right?
12/2/17, 11:53 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Yes
12/2/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Alright, but A->B doesn't mean A -> BC right?
12/2/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Indeed
12/2/17, 11:54 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Ait, thanks
12/2/17, 13:04 - ‪+31 6 46487242‬: someone who did data structures last quartile and received their grade?
12/2/17, 13:24 - ‪+30 697 453 5573‬: Not yet
12/2/17, 13:25 - ‪+30 697 453 5573‬: They were supposed to publish them yesterday
12/2/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: I can only say the administration is a mess
12/2/17, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: They are late with almost every course
12/2/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yep
12/2/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Even though Roel Bloo said in the kickoff meeting that the administration should be up to date starting from 2 weeks back
12/2/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: if A > K and AK > T , does that mean that A > T?
12/2/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No?😂
12/2/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If A=2 and K=1, then AK=2, If T=3, this does not hold
12/2/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: A > T-K
12/2/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: T/K**
12/2/17, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But we don't know what T is
12/2/17, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: i meant the functional dependancy arrow there. sorry i wasnt clear
12/2/17, 16:43 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: A -> K => A -> AK
By transitivity (since AK -> T) A -> T
12/2/17, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: thanks a lot!

12/3/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: for those of you doing datamodeling, do we construct a canonical closure of F and G combined here, or one for F separately and one for G separately?
12/3/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: cover*
12/3/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: aside from the fact that has been asked and answered thrice at least
12/3/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: you make one of F
12/3/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and then you realize that G already is one
12/3/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: after trying to apply the methods on that
12/3/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: thats about the conclusion I arrived at
12/3/17, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: thanks
12/3/17, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: haha no problem
12/3/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wouldn't even know how you would construct a cover of both at the same time
12/3/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: if you would take A→C from F and A→CD from G
12/3/17, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: theres an extraneous element there
12/3/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: and continue doing this until you reach a combined canonical cover
12/3/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ooh like that
12/3/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What would that result in? (if you tried it already)
12/3/17, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: nope, didn't try, just wanted to make sure I wouldn't be doing any unnecessary work xd
12/3/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't think you have to do that, but I am not a teacher haha
12/3/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Guys could we please use the datamodeling chat for datamodeling questions?
12/3/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: is there a group for that? if so, could you link pls?

12/3/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But it is a nice suggestion to keep things tidy
12/3/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: for question 2 of DM: do we have to show the steps of computing the closure or can we just say like A+ = ACD in 1 go
12/3/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: and yes im asking it in this chat because i didnt get put back into the dm chat
12/3/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Construct canonical covers of both F and G. Show all intermediate steps and derivations!
12/3/17, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Last part is bold
12/3/17, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: You're better of doing that, yes
12/3/17, 21:00 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Does anyone know which room the student administration of our faculty is?

This is a survey regarding how the TUe is gonna fix the lecture hall capacity problems for upcoming years, as it is going to be a huge issue probably. I'd recommend filling it in, cuz its our future as well 🙃
Everyone should have a mail about this as well, but i just found it important enough to share here as well
12/4/17, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬ added ‪+31 6 42623926‬
12/4/17, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yes please, fill this in. I was at the panel discussion for this and these results will be used to form an advice about switching to a 12 hour lecture schedule (which imho no one should want). Group Een is generally against it from what I know but having lots of people showing they don't want the 12 hour lecture scheme will be of great importance for their advice.
12/4/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Thats what i thought 👆🏻
12/4/17, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: wat is de 12 hour lecture schedule?
12/4/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There well be lectures from 08:30 - 20:30
12/4/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Lectures will be 40 mins, with shorter breaks in between and you'll have 2 shorter breaks (lunch and evening)
12/4/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
12/4/17, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: 08:30 rip me
12/4/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: wat is dat voor clownsidee
12/4/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: this is ridiculous, I love the way breaks are set up currently. Lots of time to eat at 12:30 and the 15 minute breaks are plenty
12/4/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Who is PRO this idea?
12/4/17, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'll have someone break their kneecaps
12/4/17, 17:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: @31643470096  would do it for a proper price
12/4/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They're currently using it at wageningen and like it so much after 1 year they're actively trying to get rid of it again. But the TUe thinks it's a good way to solve all their current issues with having too much students and too little room
12/4/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Okay so where do we protest
12/4/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and where do we pick up rifles and pitchforks
12/4/17, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Fill this link survey in and go to the panel discussions mentioned @ the survey

12/4/17, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: _The huge rise in student numbers has led to a presumed shortage of space in various lecture rooms all across the campus. In order to solve this problem, many options are currently being considered. A few examples are constructing/renting buildings, live streaming of lectures, better prospects of the turnout at lectures, dynamical scheduling and lastly a 12-hour schedule.

In order to make sure students can express their opinion about these various options, Groep-één, as a representative of students in the University Council, was asked to collect the input of students. A panel discussion has already taken place with students from various different backgrounds and after the survey, on December 12, a large open discussion will be organized in Auditorium 7._
12/4/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If they do the live lecture thing as solid as they do for Data Modeling all issues are solved
12/4/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: How much?
12/4/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Can even break down some buildings then
12/4/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just a teacher in a Vertigo rent-room
12/4/17, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's it
12/4/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: P  A  V  I  L  J  O  E  N
12/4/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: For starters haha
12/4/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: one or two student assistants maybe
12/4/17, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: A room for 8 will do
12/4/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nah but at least then they wouldn’t need overflow rooms
12/4/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Think that’s a good starter already
12/4/17, 17:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: exactly
12/4/17, 19:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: <Media omitted>
12/4/17, 19:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🤣👌🏻
12/4/17, 19:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
12/4/17, 20:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Meh you could easily build an auto importer
12/4/17, 20:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yeah so it even gets easier
12/4/17, 20:53 - Kevin Jilissen: There's already one built in
12/4/17, 20:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Even better
12/4/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I personlly cannot remember all the lcoations for all my lectures in a given week
12/4/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Me neither
12/4/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: that's why you have a schedule haha
12/4/17, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: so it would be nice if they were always in the same location so I dont have to check it 5 times a day
12/4/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: checking the easy web app once every 2 to 4 hours on a uni day is not that bad
12/4/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: if you cannot remember 2 locations
12/4/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: else it's once a day
12/4/17, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: in the train/bus/walking
12/4/17, 20:59 - Kevin Jilissen: I enabled syncing with google calendar, so you get it on your home screen :)
12/4/17, 21:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: even better!
12/4/17, 21:02 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They forgot to put this in but the changes would happen once every week and all be available before sundaynight so that on sundaynight you'd know the whole schedule
12/4/17, 21:18 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: It'd be great if they could then also mention which room would be the live room.
12/4/17, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah but that's not in the scope of this survey but I would certainly make sure to mention it during the open panel (if you won't do it yourselve ;) )
12/5/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 43124558‬: You don't even need to build one yourself if your service supports synchronising you can just past a link from my timetable to your calendar and it auto imports everything for you
12/5/17, 11:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: till what time is the spar at university open?
12/5/17, 11:42 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 21

12/5/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: A can of coke, beer and energy
12/5/17, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Some chocolate bars and a bag of chips
12/5/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: The box is pretty small 🙈
12/5/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: hmm
12/5/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: sounds okay, just not sure if its worth the hassle
12/5/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Until when can we get it
12/5/17, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 1800 today

12/5/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: fuck that
12/5/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: But you have a chance to get the golden ticket which gets you free lunch for a year or something
12/5/17, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: im not gonna be on uni before that time and would have to sacrifice precious time to pick up the box
12/5/17, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: They are out of boxes tho
12/5/17, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: thinking out of the box
12/5/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nice
12/5/17, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: makes my choice easier
12/5/17, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: uhh I was at the spar like an hour ago and there were a fuckton of boxes
12/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: The app said they were out...
12/5/17, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: loooool

12/8/17, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: <Media omitted>
12/8/17, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: Supremum is basically lowest upper-bound you can find
12/8/17, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: :P
12/8/17, 14:03 - Kevin Jilissen: https://www.gewis.nl/~supremum/

12/10/17, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: i think that penalty of the dm chat kick has been already more than a day

12/10/17, 16:02 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: @31642007885

12/10/17, 16:27 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Done
12/10/17, 18:48 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: guys remember the new NS schedule tomorrow. Check you route before since the trains my have different times and may not even go because of the snow
12/10/17, 18:50 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: If it's gonna snow this night then most trained are cancled tomorrow morning
12/10/17, 19:26 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: This is gonna be fun XD
12/10/17, 19:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nah tonight its not gonna be snowing
12/10/17, 19:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: At least not near Eindhoven
12/10/17, 19:29 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: People usually take trains to Eindhoven when they're not near Eindhoven, so
12/10/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: True, but at least that part is probably gonna be fine
12/10/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: better no train from the start then be stuck halfway
12/10/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Tomorrow is gonna be fun
12/10/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: <Media omitted>
12/10/17, 19:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: True
12/10/17, 21:29 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Before when is registration courses Q3 Q4 again?
12/10/17, 21:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no clue
12/10/17, 21:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: good question
12/10/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Usually somewhere before the first exam right?
12/10/17, 21:55 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: or in the week before the examweeks
12/10/17, 21:56 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: its the 7th of january
12/10/17, 21:56 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: <Media omitted>
12/10/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: according to the calendar
12/10/17, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Thanks
12/11/17, 12:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Are there people doing 3USU0 over here who have made a summary?
12/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Guys, does anyone know if there is any good video editing software available from the tue?
12/11/17, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Adobe premiere is included in the suite they provide, isn't it?
12/11/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: No I don't think so...
12/11/17, 13:32 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Uuuh dont know but the uni offers some of adobes products so there is a good chance there is something like premiere
12/11/17, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I tried looking for it, but I don't think they include After Effects and Premiere.
12/11/17, 13:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Just torrent it ?
12/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Hmm I guess we aren't artsy enough
12/11/17, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: they include all of them in the creative cloud package
12/11/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: that can be downloaded  via the tue
12/11/17, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: <Media omitted>
12/12/17, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: How long do you need to wait if you filled in your password incorrect to many times on the tue laptop?
12/12/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: 15 minutes usually
12/12/17, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: Thanks
12/12/17, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not being able to enter your own laptop because of TU intertwining
12/12/17, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Seems like something to get rid of in the first week of owning it
12/12/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Just create a local (non-domain that is) admin account and you're all set
12/12/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Short briefing regarding the Planapp status
12/12/17, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Our testpanel this morning was cancelled after we went there through the snow. There were so many issues appearing the past few days that it made no sense for us to test it today
12/12/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Also, there is a significant chance they are NOT going to make the deadline of februari (which was set because nominal students should then be able to confirm their plan)
12/12/17, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They still need to think about how to communicate this to the students
12/12/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: -End of message-
12/12/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: What would this deadline be for? Having a final planning in planapp?
12/12/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: PlanApp 2.0
12/12/17, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which should actually worm

12/12/17, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because from 90 ECTS it should be possible to validate your plan

12/12/17, 16:36 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and then the project manager was like: nah imma wait with that
12/12/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: he probably wants to try to make the deadline anyway
12/12/17, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but its very unlikely that they are gonna succeed in doing so
12/12/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: don't

Your notebook is the Zbook 15 *Studio* G3
12/13/17, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: This is actually a different notebook.
12/13/17, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Also, in the TU/e default configuration you are setup to automatically install driver updates with windows updates. So as soon as there is a fix available it will be patched automatically with windows update

12/13/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You don't even wanna know how many times I have had to help Stef because of that crooked system

12/13/17, 10:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but lets keep it on topic daan, its the no spam chat
12/13/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Agreed.
But most policies you are anoyed by actually increase security a lot. Also the reason the systems are a few minor versions behind is because of testing, we want to make sure the updates don't break functionality of TU/e software and webservices, so we can patch software and ship the patch with the windows update, or update the webservices before releasing the update in order to make sure you guys never get windows updates which break TU/e stuff... (yes we know the webservices are crappy, but thats not my department :P)
12/13/17, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: sorry
12/13/17, 10:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah i figured that much, and its very reasonable considering most students dont really care about the downsides of it, but what is funny is that if a driver fucks up everything and you go to ICT service for help, cuz you cant figure out which one exactly it is, they reply: yeah uh well... we could reinstall TUe windows for you cuz i dont see why thats bad 🤔
12/13/17, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: and that reply just doesnt make sense, as i obviously had my reasons to go through all kinds of trouble to reinstall windows myself 😅
12/13/17, 10:52 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ahh sorry for spreading it then😅
12/13/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The ICT service has the slogan "we can reinstall or we don't know"
12/13/17, 10:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's my experience with that booth anyway
12/13/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: They can also clean your fans :)
12/13/17, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: my mom can also do that
12/13/17, 11:09 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: That is the student department, I agree, they are worthless.
I work for the W&I employee department. We actually know what we are doing 😂
12/13/17, 11:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: can i drop by there if i ever have an issue i cant fix myself 😅😅
12/13/17, 11:12 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: At the desk we won't help you, but for simple software issues for which I don't need to be in the office i can most certainly try to help you if you send me a message. But only after you went to the NSC (note that I can look into their administration so I will know if you didn't)
12/13/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: aight, much appreciated
12/13/17, 11:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: lets hope its never needed tho 😅
12/17/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Are there people here running a triple monitor setup on the ZBook studio G3? And if so, how are you doing it?
12/17/17, 15:09 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: I don't, but I can try to set it up now
12/17/17, 15:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, I know it is possible, since you can just abuse the USB 3.1C ports, but I was wondering wether somebody had found a more elegant solution
12/17/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The monitors I will be using are gonna be 3 Dell U2312's btw :P
12/17/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Why not use laptop in the middle? (Just curious)
12/17/17, 15:11 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or at the side
12/17/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am currently running this setup with the laptop as the third monitor, but 1. It looks a lot less nice, and 2. Although the resolution is the same, the different screen sizes do suck a bit :P
12/17/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: True
12/17/17, 15:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And 3. Would be that I can get a third U2312 for very cheap :P
12/17/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Solid points
12/17/17, 15:13 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: Ah, in that case I can't set it up, I only have 2 monitore
12/17/17, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: displayport daisy chaining?
12/17/17, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Idk if the U2312 support that, I will have to have a call with Dell tomorrow
12/17/17, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Use a docking with multiple display outputs and you're set
12/17/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or
12/17/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Use both USB C ports and the hdmi port?
12/17/17, 17:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: As ur probably putting ur laptop somewhere out of sight anyway
12/17/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That’s the ez way at least
12/17/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, this is the not-elegant solution haha
12/17/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: True
12/17/17, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Using USB-C to display port cables
12/17/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You can get those for 17,95 on bol.com
12/17/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 1 meter
12/17/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or 19,95 for two meter
12/17/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: S
12/17/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Amazon.de is even cheaper, so I'mma go with that route haha
12/17/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But using only one port would nicer
12/17/17, 17:47 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ah aight
12/17/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yeah, I've looked into docking stations, but the only one supporting triple displays cost 300 euros :p
12/17/17, 17:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Which also could buy me  a set of new monitors haha
12/17/17, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: by one of this and cut it in half, u have two of 1 meter for 9,98 instead of 17,95
12/17/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah those are expensive AF
12/17/17, 18:05 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Looool
12/17/17, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 46487242‬: Can someone share the link of the groupsapp for discrete structures of this quartile?
12/17/17, 20:00 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: ask @31642007885

12/17/17, 20:08 - ‪+31 6 46487242‬: Thank you!
12/18/17, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: Today I discovered that Osiris says that 2IS70 (DBL app development) in 2018/2019 will be in timeslot D instead of B. The planapp is still saying timeslot B for next year. This change results for me in two courses in the same timeslot in Y3Q3, namely 2IS70 and 2IC80 (lab on offensive computer security).
12/18/17, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I'll be doing both subjects in Y3Q3 too, and @31630674224 too
12/18/17, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: D:
12/18/17, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: same

12/18/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Idk, just do it today :P
12/18/17, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Asking almost takes longer than actually doing it
12/18/17, 17:57 - ‪+31 6 57866325‬: January 7
12/19/17, 11:21 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: https://goo.gl/forms/ZhiicDnbaqSu0Fmz1 hey guys, I'd appreciate it if everyone would fill in this survey :)
12/19/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: What is the definition of student house?
12/19/17, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because I live in a house with students, but I wouldn't really call it a student house
12/19/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: like as if you share the same kitchen, or you just talk to eachother a lot
12/19/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Achterstallig onderhoud, teringbende, combinatie van die 2
12/19/17, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ja, ik woon in een vestide-complex, dus je hebt niet echt het huis-aspect
12/19/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Achterstallig onderhoud valt erg mee, teringbende ook niet, we doen echt 0 samen
12/19/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Dan woon je niet in een studentenhuis
12/19/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: hahaha dan kan je nee invullen
12/19/17, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ja, daarom vroeg ik het :P
12/19/17, 11:28 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: my gender is not on the list

12/21/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes, that works!
12/21/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: How?
12/21/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Because it doesn't seem to do the job for me ;/
12/21/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just opens a cmd prompt real quickly
12/21/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Restart your pc?
12/21/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: For me it worked?
12/21/17, 15:39 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I'll do a quickrestart
12/21/17, 17:06 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Make sure you are on campus and connected to the tue-wpa2 network, you need to be able to access our license server which **should** not be accessible from outside the tue (even not through vpn)
12/21/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah already found the problem
12/21/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Opening it as admin doesn't work
12/21/17, 17:08 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You have to just open it
12/21/17, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: That's with all of the tue installers... If it needs admin stuff it will just ask
12/21/17, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: I assumed you wouldn't randomly run anything as admin without checking without first😂 kind of a bad habit over there
12/21/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Well my experience with the tue installer stuff was that it just wouldn't run without admin shit and not give me any notice whatsoever
12/21/17, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I never run anything I don't trust with admin
12/21/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Installing the adobe stuff for instance, it you don't run it as admin it won't work nor will it tell you it doesn't work because of not having admin rights
12/21/17, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It just sits there doing nothing
1/2/18, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: Anyone else who cant login on canvas or mytue?

1/5/18, 09:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm, use your tu/email or somthing like that IIRC
1/5/18, 10:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: @31643222030 , do you still know how it works from the DAE adventures?
1/5/18, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: For me it worked by not logging in with s1234567
1/5/18, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: But with TUE/s1234567
1/5/18, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: That should prob be a backslash
1/5/18, 10:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: TUE\s..... should work
1/5/18, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: If not try username@tue.nl or username@campus.tue.nl as username
1/5/18, 10:25 - Luke Houben: Yeah i'm using that, still says my username or password is wrong
1/5/18, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: <Media omitted>
1/5/18, 10:30 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: AFAIK snumber@tue.nl or snumber@student.tue.nl
1/5/18, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: it could be that its trying to login with your laptop credentials, which then probably doesnt match what eduroam wants from you
1/5/18, 10:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i had that problem for i while but cant really remember how i fixed it

1/5/18, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But Idk, if multiple people have the same issue it’s probably some bad batteries
1/5/18, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 20321013‬: Awesome, i did not notice anything about my battery. They want to change it for free. New is better right? Nope, lets give them faulty batteries

1/8/18, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If i had them i would
1/8/18, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I know but I can still ask :) but they don’t have any practice material. The “assignment” is enough but they don’t have the answer keys...
1/10/18, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: People who are taking DBL Algorithms this quartile, has anyone of you noticed strange behaviour in the 'final' set of tests?
1/10/18, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Because for us, it looks like we suddenly have to correctly drop off all the customers that spawn in the training time, which wasn't the case in all the previous tests
1/10/18, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Actually nvm, turns out we introduced an off-by-one error when we thought we fixed one
1/11/18, 11:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Will someone with Software Science major kindly check whether the Planapp shows 2IC60 (computer networks and security) as a mandatory major course?
1/11/18, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We're at the Planapp test thingy currently and for myself (WbS) it does show as a mandatory major course, but for Stef, with SfS, it does not
1/11/18, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And because of that he did not realise that it is not a valid option for the Security package
1/11/18, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So now he needs to flip around his planning after adding another course for that package

1/11/18, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes, that is a known fact
1/11/18, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But it's more regarding the Planapp functionality in this Planapp test panel
1/11/18, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: It does not show up red, it shows up blue ?
1/11/18, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Wtf does blue even mean
1/11/18, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Could you screenshot your Planapp schedule Tom?
1/11/18, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Uh sure

1/11/18, 14:00 - Luke Houben: Yeah too much work to cut 50-100 pieces😅
1/11/18, 14:00 - Luke Houben: But we can't print that format?
1/11/18, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Dude you can cut them all at once
1/11/18, 14:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: there's machinery for that
1/11/18, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Even present at the print location iirc
1/11/18, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: you can probably print it at mf
1/11/18, 14:02 - Luke Houben: Ahh okay, didn't know that
1/11/18, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: but you cannot use your printing money
1/11/18, 14:02 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Use the printing money for A4 regular prints if you want cheap paper and just go there to cut it
1/11/18, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or cut it at the Vertigo cellar
1/11/18, 14:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: there's a paper cutting machine there as well
1/11/18, 14:03 - Luke Houben: Alright, thanks guys!

1/12/18, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: although there are groups who had their feedback last monday
1/12/18, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Wow, rude
1/12/18, 21:38 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: My group handed it in a week before it was due
1/12/18, 21:39 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Still nothing because we have the 6th thesis
1/12/18, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: we have first so that does not matter i think
1/12/18, 21:46 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Same we have second still nothin
1/12/18, 21:46 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: He sent us a mail saying our group would be last since we had the 6th(last) thesis
1/14/18, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: Are there lessons for USE rational agents tomorrow?

1/18/18, 14:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Does anyone know if it’s okay to skip the first week of software specification and programming methods or there will be some mandatory events?
1/18/18, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am currently following software engineering, which is the successor of software specification, and that one is a joke
1/18/18, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is like USE: You are better off not going to the lectures
1/18/18, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: What do you need to do and know?
1/18/18, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ehrm, just talk about why stuff is wrong
1/18/18, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Like just nitpick on mistakes
1/18/18, 14:57 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I have to look into the exam, but the exercises are not that hard
1/18/18, 14:57 - Casper Smits: Are the exams of Software Specification hard? Like, do you need to learn a lot?
1/18/18, 15:05 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: for programming methods there is practicum and instruction so I was wondering whether any to these is mandatory
1/18/18, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: I don't think so
1/18/18, 15:14 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: but you do get a lot of time consuming exercises, so if you can't figure them out they might be useful
1/18/18, 15:15 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: I'm not sure what the difference between those is though
1/21/18, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬ added ‪+31 6 21372984‬

1/21/18, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I think it looks good, although I don't have the problem myself
1/21/18, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: The only thing I would maybe change is leave out the S-number, or replace it with your 09-number
1/21/18, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alrighty
1/21/18, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: ill do that

1/21/18, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You could send it to study counselor as well, but I don’t think that will do much good
1/21/18, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But idk, better safe than sorry
1/21/18, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And the responsible teacher for both courses

1/21/18, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah but at least he can’t say that you should have sent it to them
1/21/18, 13:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: So I’d include them just for the sake of it being possible
1/21/18, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: should i maybe remove Roel Bloo's name then and just refer to him as "study counsellor"?
1/21/18, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am more for naming and shaming
1/21/18, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Especially for Roel
1/21/18, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright

1/21/18, 14:36 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: wouldn’t that be a great response
1/21/18, 19:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is there a summary for rational agents anywhere?

1/25/18, 14:09 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Would it have been inhumane if you had started 8 weeks ago like you were supposed to, yet postponed it to exactly 1 day before the test like literally everyone else does for every USE course which in turn halves the pass rate of all USE courses?
1/25/18, 14:10 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Not quite, yet I still ask
1/25/18, 14:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: It is a bit "Own fault, big bump" that it is inhumane :P

1/29/18, 15:55 - ‪+31 6 18468934‬: Three times is shipsright I hope 😅
1/29/18, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: #discrete
1/29/18, 15:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 🤔what about courses that are given in  multiple quartiles ? Lets say q1 and then q3 if lets say you fail q1 exam and the resit in q2 can you take the same course in q3 if its offered ?
1/29/18, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: You can however only have a course 1 time in a year
1/29/18, 15:57 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ah ok
1/29/18, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Third time is the charm :p
1/29/18, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Well yes but not really, if it is given 'two times' under different course codes you could try to do the second one. This is the case for Business Information Systems, which is both a master and bachelor course
1/29/18, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Yeah, but they have to be distinct codes
1/30/18, 16:13 - Luke Houben: <Media omitted>
1/30/18, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yes
1/30/18, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: https://tweakers.net/nieuws/134565/microsoft-brengt-update-uit-om-problematische-spectre-patch-terug-te-draaien.html
1/30/18, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: U are on intel hd graphics ver 22.x
1/30/18, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Manually update it to 23 and that fixes everything
1/30/18, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Tried installing that but that didn't work for some reason @31642623926
1/30/18, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Trust me Luke, @31623837581  and I have been dealing with that problem way to long and that’s the fix
1/30/18, 16:15 - Luke Houben: Alright i will try that, thanks
1/30/18, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Could be that it says ur unable to, due to some unknown fault, then u have to go back to an earlier version and go to 23 from there
1/30/18, 16:32 - Luke Houben: The driver setup keeps telling me that the install is not validated for my computer, although the drivers are for an i7 6700
1/30/18, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Jeah that’s what I meant
1/30/18, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: For the 6700 or the 6700HQ
1/30/18, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It’s not true obviously
1/30/18, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But then u have to go back a few versions
1/30/18, 16:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: And from there go to 23
1/30/18, 16:33 - Luke Houben: Already on the old driver from 2015 now
1/30/18, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I went from like version 22 to 16 to 23 or something
1/30/18, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Also try doing it really manually, like selecting the driver yourself by browsing on ur pc
1/30/18, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Otherwise ask Jort, I’m not at home now so can’t check on my own laptop 🙃
1/30/18, 16:37 - Luke Houben: Ah the setup loaded now after i changed back to basic display adapter
1/30/18, 16:38 - Luke Houben: Okay 23 is installed, thanks stef!
1/30/18, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nice 👌🏻
1/31/18, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
1/31/18, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Click courses in the sidebar, then 'all courses'
1/31/18, 08:52 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Then un-star all the courses you don't want to see
1/31/18, 08:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Ah, thanks!
1/31/18, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: People
1/31/18, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do not forget to grant 2ID50 some major points for the livestreaming of lectures in you course survey
1/31/18, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: they need that in order to be allowed to use this stuff in other courses as well
1/31/18, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Our feedback is considered important
1/31/18, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Did that, said the rest sucked
1/31/18, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: I also mentioned that George's voice is very calming and sleep inducing
1/31/18, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hahaha
1/31/18, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: didn't someone say the expected date of the grades to be released for datamodelling would be today?
1/31/18, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: Good chance they finished grading already, but you know how slow the administration is
1/31/18, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: true
1/31/18, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Anyone checked canvas?
1/31/18, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: not on osiris at least
1/31/18, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: and nothing on canvas either
1/31/18, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Okay
1/31/18, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Maybe if we mail George that he would put the grades in a file?
1/31/18, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: If it's the case that administration is slow af again
1/31/18, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: George sounds like the kind of person that would actually do that
1/31/18, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Never hurts to mail tho
1/31/18, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes
1/31/18, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Add that the administration has a habit of ruining their good work
1/31/18, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Maybe wait like a day or two?
1/31/18, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: They're still really fast then
1/31/18, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Correct
1/31/18, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They have 3 weeks anyway, but it would be sad if the course team were to be quick and the administration delaying their effort
1/31/18, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, Alexander tweeted a few days ago that at least his part is done
2/1/18, 07:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys the algorithms part is finished right?
2/1/18, 07:55 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: all pseudocodes are present or some still have to be convertred?
2/1/18, 07:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Fukc
2/1/18, 07:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: wrong chat
2/1/18, 07:56 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: sorry
2/1/18, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: until what time is it possible to leave the MetaForum building? Any restrictions?
2/1/18, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If they do not spot you where you're sitting I suggest just staying there and see what happens
2/1/18, 21:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: if you have the evening off
2/1/18, 21:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 23
2/1/18, 21:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: 23.00 or 23.30
2/1/18, 21:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think people leave at 23. And then staff closes at 23.30
2/1/18, 21:34 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: okay thanks
2/1/18, 21:34 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Longest i have stayed in library was 23 and then the guard told me to leave
2/1/18, 21:37 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: they start asking you to get out of meta from 22:30 / 22:45 (they ask 2 to 3 times) and they kinda want to have everyone outside and the doors closed before 23:05.
2/1/18, 21:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sounds like a challenge to stay the night
2/1/18, 23:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: There is food too
2/1/18, 23:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Vending machines
2/1/18, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There's also motion sensors
2/1/18, 23:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: You can stay all night and play pubg in bloos office

2/3/18, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31643222030 have you spoken to anyone yet about business information systems by chance?
2/3/18, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Does anyone know if there's a way to see when the resits are for Q3 subjects, so during the exam weeks in Q4?
2/3/18, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: real confident aren’t you
2/3/18, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: some courses put both the exam and the resit dates on canvas
2/3/18, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: databases did for example
2/3/18, 14:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you could maybe check on there?
2/3/18, 14:11 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: Exam weeks of Q4 seem to start on "Mon 25 Jun" but which days there will be resits might not even be determined yet.
2/3/18, 14:19 - ‪+31 6 57866325‬: Go to mytimetable.tue.nl, click on overview in the top right and search for your course. Then view timetable and look for the exam weeks in Q4
2/3/18, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: Well I can't even see my resits from Q2 yet, so that probably won't work.
2/3/18, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Hypothetically speaking 😇
2/3/18, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: oh nvm, I see them now (they were not in red)
2/3/18, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: You can search the syllabus of those courses
2/3/18, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: They mention the dates for exams and resits most of the time
2/3/18, 14:25 - ‪+31 6 57685867‬: Thanks guys, will try
2/4/18, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Are there others here that have the course 0LAUK0 robots everywhere?
2/4/18, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: We're supposed to start tomorrow 08:45 but there is no email yet and the Canvas page is still offline
2/4/18, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: A bit odd to start like this
2/4/18, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm can already imagine walking to Paviljoen in the early monday morning to hear teacher fucked up

2/4/18, 23:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Gaslab

2/6/18, 11:18 - ‪+31 6 48217339‬ joined using this group's invite link
2/6/18, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Alright so: to anyone who planned business information systems in q3 next year, roel and yves believe that they have been clear enough to make it our problem instead of theirs. I’d like to propose to all go to their office together to discuss the problem
2/6/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that way we can find the best solution all at once instead of all going there seperately
2/6/18, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Sounds good, maybe tomorrow in the break?
2/6/18, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: think it might be a good idea to do it during their actual office hours
2/6/18, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that way we make sure that we actually. meet them there
2/6/18, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Okay, when are those?
2/6/18, 13:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: uhhh tuesday and thursday, not sure what times tho
2/6/18, 13:40 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Good idea, if I don't have something planned ill join
2/6/18, 13:47 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: same
2/6/18, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Roel never makes anything clear, so that can’t be the case
2/6/18, 13:58 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I will join too, if its not today at least
2/6/18, 14:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Roel makes it clear that Fontys IS an option
2/6/18, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: nee dimi
2/6/18, 14:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Hi rick !

2/6/18, 14:28 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it will probably be after the break though
2/7/18, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: Is the programming methods instruction cancelled?
2/7/18, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: Or is it still on?
2/7/18, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: And is there a group chat?
2/7/18, 13:50 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: We have instructions

2/12/18, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Introduction to cryptology is graded
2/12/18, 12:56 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: On osiris?

2/12/18, 12:57 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So they are working today
2/12/18, 12:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes, it is monday
2/12/18, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: tue isn't closed, there are just no lectures. If they wanted they could just continue with hw etc
2/12/18, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Do the working days for grading keep counting as well?
2/12/18, 13:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I bet no
2/12/18, 13:06 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And its likely that they are working with "carnaval antimotivation"😅
2/12/18, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it's currently not a public holiday period, so technically when they say 15 business days it'd include this week
2/12/18, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Not a public holiday *yet*
2/12/18, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: carnavalvrij.nl
2/12/18, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: don't spam here
2/12/18, 13:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: I think workdays are counted by institution not by coutry wide standarts
2/12/18, 13:09 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: pls it's just a beer add rick
2/12/18, 13:09 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And tue calendar says holiday this week so i guess they dont 😑
2/12/18, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: well, regardless of what is and isn't considered a work day, they're still too late with giving back grades
2/12/18, 13:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Good point 😁
2/12/18, 13:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But i am pretty sure they dont care
2/12/18, 18:11 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Not today 😂👌

2/16/18, 08:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But I like the fact that you think about informing us
2/16/18, 13:43 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: It seems like the final grade for one of my courses is computed / entered wrongly in Osiris. Who should I contact to fix this? Student administration? The responsible lecturer?
2/16/18, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Try both
2/16/18, 13:44 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Fair enough haha
2/16/18, 13:45 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Thanks!
2/16/18, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: You can also spam roel bloo
2/16/18, 20:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Always send that kind of mails to as many people as you can think of
2/16/18, 20:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Increases the chance of getting a semi-fast response
2/16/18, 20:35 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And semi competent response
2/16/18, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: True
2/16/18, 21:24 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: And a lot of not competent responses
2/18/18, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: does anyone know in which timeslot dbl algorithms will be given in Q4? right now it says B and/or  D but in Q2 it was only one timeslot...
2/18/18, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: if we can pick one or if we just get divided
2/18/18, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Officially it covers both of the timeslots
2/18/18, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/18, 19:00 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: We could pick one of those groups
2/18/18, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You can also see it on the course it’s website
2/18/18, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: <Media omitted>
2/18/18, 19:01 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: But ofc it depends on your group in terms of how often and when you meet
2/18/18, 19:05 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: ah oke thanks a lot!
2/21/18, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 16636665‬: C.T. Nohai, if ur in this group pls message me so i can add you to our Software Specification group

3/1/18, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Can't you see it on the plan app?
3/1/18, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: If it is not in osiris yet mail Bloo, I guess he can contact the course teachers
3/1/18, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: It's not there yet, so I guess I'll sent an email
3/1/18, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: In case somebody likes to know as well, 2018-2019 Q4 timeslot B
3/1/18, 18:52 - ‪+31 6 29387563‬: thanks
3/1/18, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Is there a way to unregister for a course?
3/1/18, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Osiris -> De-register
3/1/18, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: But that doesn't work for courses from this quartile for some reason
3/1/18, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Then mailing the student administration may work
3/1/18, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: I don't think you can de-register from courses you are taking right now
3/1/18, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: Weird, when oase was still a thing you could...
3/1/18, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: This is your best bet
3/1/18, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: I'll try that then
3/2/18, 01:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I think you cannot deregister for bachelor courses
3/2/18, 01:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Idk if that's the case
3/3/18, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Does anyone know when the exam period of Q4 ends?
3/3/18, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: 6th of July I think
3/3/18, 20:47 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: ALright thanks :)
3/4/18, 21:13 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: I'm probably a bit late, but since when is cs-students not available anymore?
3/4/18, 21:14 - Luke Houben: There are some issues atm, will be resolved later
3/4/18, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: ahh okay
3/5/18, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Are the examination dates for the resits in summer vacation's interim already known?
3/5/18, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: There is this magical thing called the internet
3/5/18, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: https://educationguide.tue.nl/studying/planning/academic-year-agenda/
3/5/18, 15:43 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Aug 13 - Aug 18
3/5/18, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: First of all, that site is down for maintenance

Second of all, I know the period in which they can be but I wondered if the exact dates were also decided yet
3/5/18, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: and we found them after having some amazing journey through the tue systems
3/5/18, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 41889265‬: In mytimetable you can select overview on top of the page. If you search there for a course, then the resit is in the timetable.
3/5/18, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: yeah we found out like that
3/5/18, 15:58 - ‪+31 6 46487242‬: Does someone know how I can register for a resit of a course I did pass?
3/5/18, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I would guess on osiris with the course code
3/5/18, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 46487242‬: that doesn't work. It says there is nothing to register for
3/5/18, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Mail to student administration
3/5/18, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 46487242‬: Okay thanks both :)
3/5/18, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 36419661‬ left
3/6/18, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: For anyone who managed to increase their grade during the 2ID50 exam inspection, did your grade already get updated on osiris?
3/6/18, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: no
3/6/18, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: gekke john
3/6/18, 17:02 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Ja man moet wel
3/8/18, 08:55 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: Are we still automatically registered for resits or do we have to di that ouselves now?
3/8/18, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Should still be automatic
3/8/18, 08:56 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: Ah, thx, already found it. Computer graphics resit did not appear in my timetable but is in osiris
3/8/18, 19:51 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: anyone here has any experience with the textgreek package in latex? it allows you to type greek letters by using \textalpha, \textbeta etc, but I cannot get it to work, my document keeps saying \textalpha and \textbeta instead of the actual greek letters, anyone that can help?
3/8/18, 19:58 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: Just use \alpha, \beta. Leave out the text.
3/8/18, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: doesn't appear to work, sadly
3/8/18, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Within mathmode
3/8/18, 19:59 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Try putting them between $
3/8/18, 20:04 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: none of that appears to work
3/8/18, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: $\alpha$ should work
3/8/18, 20:05 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Results in italic alpha
3/8/18, 20:06 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: do greek letters maybe not work in a pseudocode section?
3/8/18, 20:37 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Does it work outside the pseudocode section?
3/8/18, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: outside the pseudocode section, the dollarsigns work in making something italic, but the /alpha still does not work
3/8/18, 20:38 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: \alpha*
3/8/18, 20:50 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Did you include the amsmath package
3/8/18, 20:51 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: yeah, it was already included
3/9/18, 10:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: I know it might have been asked a few times before but how do I change my postal address for Tue mailing?
3/9/18, 10:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Through Osiris maybe?
3/9/18, 10:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not sure actually. But what do you still get physical mail for?
3/9/18, 10:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because I don't
3/9/18, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: dunno
3/9/18, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: just updating all my services
3/9/18, 10:12 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: 6 months overdue
3/9/18, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 😂
3/9/18, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: and tue is kinda important i guessed but maybe ur right
3/9/18, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In Osiris.tue.nl there is "personalia" and them on the top "change address"
3/9/18, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I just checked
3/9/18, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: ah thanks
3/9/18, 10:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Does anyone have any points for the kringgesprek that should be addressed?
3/9/18, 10:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Mainly about topics of this quartile
3/9/18, 10:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Subjects* lol
3/9/18, 10:49 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: People punch me during lectures @31643470096
3/9/18, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not subject related
3/9/18, 10:50 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Do you know what mainly means?
3/9/18, 10:55 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: More multiple choice questions and fewer open ones for the 2ipc0 final exam!
3/9/18, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: The fact that Erik Luit needs to be replaced or should have intense presentation training
3/9/18, 11:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: On it 😂
3/9/18, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah you really emphasized well on this😂 I think Roel got the message loud and clear
3/9/18, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yep :p
3/9/18, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Good that I had to go
3/9/18, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I could've been more subtle. But it definitely was clear 😂
3/9/18, 14:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hahaha
3/9/18, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 21844269‬: How do you change the Osiris password?
3/9/18, 16:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is the TU password you use for everything. Maybe MyTue has a link to do that?
3/9/18, 16:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: The IT helpdesk can do that for you as well iirc
3/9/18, 16:32 - Luke Houben: If you still have the TU/e windows, press ctrl+alt+delete and click change password
3/9/18, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So that basically applies to people who use 12345678 as their password in terms of experience
3/9/18, 16:35 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 🙊
3/9/18, 16:39 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: https://access.tue.nl

The "official" way of changing your password
3/9/18, 16:40 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: be aware: if you have cookies from any tue service it will probably not work :p
3/13/18, 12:21 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Does anyone have any experience with installing virtual machines on Linux using VirtualBox? I've got a problem and need some help :)
3/13/18, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: I thought @Stef did that once if I remember correctly
3/13/18, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Goeie tag
3/13/18, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But no, not in Linux
3/13/18, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: @31649673225 may be able to help
3/13/18, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: not sure, but i think he has worked with it before
3/13/18, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: My specific question is that I want to have the virtual machines installed on a different hard drive
3/13/18, 12:27 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks at least :)
3/13/18, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: But changing the installation path doesnt work as it gives permission errors or smth
3/13/18, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 20276432‬: https://askubuntu.com/questions/549931/how-to-install-a-virtual-machine-on-a-different-physical-hard-drive-using-virtua#550101
3/13/18, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I saw that one already, have googled for hours ;) That does not work, simply changing the path doesnt work
3/13/18, 12:30 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=install+virtual+machines+on+a+different+harddrive+using+VirtualBox
3/13/18, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Like I said, I have googled for hours...
3/13/18, 12:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Cant find a solution
3/13/18, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: alright..
3/13/18, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i meet mart in an hour or smth, ill ask for you
3/13/18, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks alot :)
3/13/18, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no prob
3/13/18, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I can have a look for you on thursday if you come to our meeting early
3/13/18, 12:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah thanks Jort, I will be early then
3/13/18, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: lol
3/13/18, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: don't spam please
3/13/18, 13:20 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: anyone else got an email about doing a diagnostic test for english? If so, do you know if it required to do it, because they only mentioned that it is useful to assess your current level of English
3/13/18, 13:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Everyone got it and it's up to you whether you want to use it
3/13/18, 13:22 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: it's a "service" so you should be fine ^^
3/13/18, 13:23 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: I mean, I got 2 cambridge certificates for english, so I think I should be fine
3/13/18, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: but you'll never know what oddities the TUE wants you to do
3/13/18, 13:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What if they ask you about food sensors and things like that ?
3/13/18, 13:24 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: it's just if you feel a little rusty or know that you're the next Vink it might be advisable but it's not mandatory whatsoever.
3/13/18, 13:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Not sure how they think your VWO diploma still matters at this point. Regardless to those Cambridge certificaties which many people have I feel like my English has improved more over the past two years than it ever did before
3/13/18, 13:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Could be linked with you studying in english 😆
3/13/18, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes it does
3/13/18, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: just using the language is the best way to improve. Your VWO mark is only an indication for yourself. If you feel proficient enough it should be ok
3/13/18, 13:26 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Whats a VWO mark?
3/13/18, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: VWO mark is an indication for those that stopped school 2 years ago
3/13/18, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Highschool
3/13/18, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: it's our highschool mark
3/13/18, 13:27 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Also this email went to all students I think so also the people following a study given in Dutch
3/13/18, 13:27 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Wait so you guys can apply with high school mark?
3/13/18, 13:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: If you have a highschool diploma of VWO level then you can apply
3/13/18, 13:29 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: it was really advised to also have a specific kind of math but that's about it. But we have a lot of different high school levels and you need to have the highest one
3/13/18, 13:29 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh ok makes more sence now
3/13/18, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: we have vmbo-kader, vmbo-basis, vmbo-t, havo, vwo, gymnasium as a basis in ascending order
3/13/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Where is Mavo in that list
3/13/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or was that some vmbo level
3/13/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: that's vmbo-t i think
3/13/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ahh
3/13/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And then there's even some extra guidance form of vmbo iirc
3/13/18, 13:31 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: So many levels 🐦
3/13/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: yeah you also have LWOO and stuff
3/13/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And then one step lower is a mental hospital
3/13/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 57568254‬: Mavo was the old system
3/13/18, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: but these are the regular levels, but you've got many different extra's aswel
3/13/18, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: What level are they offering?
3/13/18, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: for english now?
3/13/18, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: I doubt that it’s higher than C2?
3/13/18, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Yeah
3/13/18, 13:32 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: don't know if they stated that exactly
3/13/18, 13:33 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: but i doubt they'll give higher than C2 since that's already close to native and on an academic level
3/13/18, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: the courses are mostly for academic writing but if you took something like IB English it probably won't be that helpful for you
3/13/18, 13:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Quick fact if your IQ IS LESS THAN 85 you are 90% less likely to find ANY kind of job in US.( below 79 you are clinicly  retarded ) and 10-15% of americans fall in this group between 79-85🧠
3/13/18, 13:36 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: spam
3/13/18, 13:38 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Don't spam pls
3/13/18, 18:49 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: <Media omitted>
3/13/18, 18:50 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: The int[][] should be a square matrix
3/13/18, 18:50 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: That's what this says
3/13/18, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: To make the relation well defined, so the relation between all possible pairs can be indicated
3/13/18, 18:51 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Ahh got it! Thanks! Makes sense.
3/16/18, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Someone in this group that is familiar with setting up a DNS server ? Preferably with BIND on Linux?
3/16/18, 17:54 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: 👆
3/16/18, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Bind9 on a raspberry pi
3/16/18, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hmm, I am trying to get Bind to work on a virtual machine, but it cant find my zone file -.-
3/16/18, 17:56 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Even though it 100% exists and it is able to find other files in that folder
3/17/18, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just to be sure
3/17/18, 10:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Everyone that is not yet signed up for their Q4 courses:

the deadline is 25-03
3/17/18, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Thanks
3/17/18, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is there anyone in this group that knows whether for the USE course "robots everywhere" [0LAUK0], the meeting contributions are taken into account as well for the individual final grades?
3/17/18, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Considering the teachers are writing down stuff during the weekly checkup meeting
3/17/18, 23:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well they don’t really now ur name
3/17/18, 23:34 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I think your individual grade only depends on peer review
3/17/18, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: hmm
3/17/18, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: thanks for sharing your view :)
3/17/18, 23:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
3/17/18, 23:42 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well meetings affect the group grade I believe
3/17/18, 23:43 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Like the way you answer their questions and so on and whether they feel you know whatcha doin
3/17/18, 23:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: There is an individual effort included in the way different members would answer questions according to how well they are aware of their team's research, one could argue
3/17/18, 23:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think you could be right, would just prefer my thought to be reality 😂
3/17/18, 23:53 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I also thought so but for my group they never actually asked my name so they don’t really know who’s who
3/17/18, 23:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They have the images on your campus card available online, so I reasoned they could very well have those on one of their laptops
3/17/18, 23:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I understood from a team member that last year there we significant differences among a team
3/17/18, 23:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Like 4.6 up to a 7
3/17/18, 23:55 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just peer reviews could not have caused that
3/18/18, 00:08 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Well I don’t like this system a lot and hope it will never apply again cause I know many ppl who did so much but were so shy they couldn’t say anything at the meeting which resulted in tutor believing he/she doesn’t now anything and barely contributes
3/18/18, 00:08 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Especially at the engineering design
3/18/18, 00:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Hmm I partly agree, except that in engineering design it was stressed out like a 100 times (at least by our tutor) that telling what you did since the last meeting would improve your meeting grade a lot.

He even gave some people tips in case they did not talk enough yet
3/18/18, 00:19 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: For it was like 
Meeting 1 you talk to less
Meeting 2 you talk to much
3/18/18, 00:20 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Once it was like one student didn’t say anything st all during a meeting and I was like 50/50 
And tutor was like, “everybody did great, and you talk too less”
3/18/18, 00:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I was like “ common this guys didn’t even say a word “ (in my head obviously)
But whatever
3/18/18, 00:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Sorry for spam
3/18/18, 00:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Sounds like you had a shit tutor :/
3/18/18, 00:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I got hated hahaha
3/19/18, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What does ~ in Python do?
3/19/18, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: binary ones complement
3/19/18, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It flips the bits basically
3/19/18, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah people are using it on data
3/19/18, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So it takes the complement of that data Iguess
3/19/18, 10:13 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: https://docs.python.org/2/library/operator.html#mapping-operators-to-functions
3/19/18, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/operator.html#mapping-operators-to-functions same goes for 3.6 btw
3/19/18, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which you're probably using
3/19/18, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Yeah thanks
3/19/18, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It's for people from data analytics
3/19/18, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ah
3/19/18, 10:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: They want to remove data from a table
3/19/18, 10:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So they specify the data removed and copy the table with the complement of the wrong data
3/21/18, 13:05 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Can someone explain me why the tu decide to make by mail not working on my apps and then dont make sure the webmail is working?
3/21/18, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: They’re switching the mail to office365 I think
3/21/18, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You can login on outlook.office365.com
3/21/18, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Jup
3/21/18, 13:10 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Thnx
3/21/18, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I received an email this morning in my standard windows 10 mail app that the conversion was finished
3/21/18, 13:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And it works without having to do anything myself
3/21/18, 13:26 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: I have to reconfigure everything
3/21/18, 13:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In which application?
3/21/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Outlook for android and windows
3/21/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Both had to be reconfigured for me
3/21/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Ahh right
3/21/18, 13:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did the guide the TU supplied work?
3/21/18, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Outlook just asked me to sign in again
3/21/18, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: This time for office 365
3/21/18, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That worked perfectly fine
3/21/18, 13:34 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: That still didnt work for me
3/21/18, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Had to delete the account and add it again
3/21/18, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Nothing works for me
3/21/18, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lol Martin
3/21/18, 13:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You just have to login with ur email address instead of TUe\...
3/21/18, 13:35 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Strange i can go in my tue timetable perfectly fine didnt have to do anything
3/21/18, 13:36 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: And the e mail
3/21/18, 13:48 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's a genetic issue
3/21/18, 14:07 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Anyone here who has had success connecting to shared folders on TUe VPN on Linux?
3/21/18, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: What are those shared folders for
3/21/18, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Getting the windows software files
3/21/18, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I want to get photoshop on my desktop PC but my laptop is running linux
3/21/18, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Afaik you can only get that while being physically at the tue
3/21/18, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Exactly
3/21/18, 14:50 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: doesnt the vpn allow to you to be physically at the tue though?
3/21/18, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: There is a way supposedly, but that requires specific knowledge about rerouting all ur stuff and making ur pc think it’s at the tue
3/21/18, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nope
3/21/18, 14:51 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: well, thats stupid
3/21/18, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes, because limitations of one of the most used protocols in the world are stupid...
3/21/18, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yes, because restricting students from spending all TUe software licenses on friends and family or even selling them is stupid...
3/21/18, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Oh no wait, that makes perfect sense 🤔🤔
3/21/18, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: That isn't stupid, It is about complaining that the IP exactly works as intended that is stupid
3/21/18, 14:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: True, but they could’ve made it available when connected through vpn
3/21/18, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Like with some of the software they offer
3/21/18, 14:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: But it makes perfect sense for them to only allow installation whilst physically at the tue
3/21/18, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: Thanks for the helpful not-arrogant replies guys, apreciate it
3/21/18, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Geen probleem
3/21/18, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I am phisically at the tue
3/21/18, 15:22 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: That's why I'm asking how to do it on my linux laptop
3/21/18, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Maybe you can download it from Adobe directly and update the license with the link on the tue website
3/21/18, 15:30 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: That way you can get tue newest versions of Adobe CC programs at Windows at least
3/21/18, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Alternatively, use an ftp client on your laptop while you are physically at the TU and download the executable you need, then install it on your desktop at home
3/21/18, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: That's what worked for me
3/21/18, 15:38 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Worked for me as well (for the adobe package)
3/21/18, 15:52 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: That was indeed my idea, but the problem is to get the install files in the first place
3/21/18, 15:53 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Or if someone could download the license file from the tue site and share it, that may also solve my problem
3/21/18, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: how are those replies arrogant? 🤔
3/21/18, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: She said not-arrogant
3/21/18, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: fucktard
3/21/18, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah but they were not at all helpful for achieving his goal, so sarcasm is very likely in this context
3/21/18, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: fucktard
3/21/18, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I have no further reply

3/21/18, 17:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I just heard that Beau is not a she. My apologies Beau, it was an assumption because of your name
3/21/18, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If he was a she it would be Belle anyway

3/21/18, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: this is the no spam chat

3/22/18, 09:57 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Does anyone have some good resources, either paid or free, to gain a better understanding of either C or C++ as a Java programmer?
3/22/18, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: code academy
3/22/18, 10:02 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: 😂
3/22/18, 10:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I think youtube tutorials are better than codecademy
3/22/18, 10:21 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Any particular tutorials in mind?
3/22/18, 10:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nope, sorry ;p
3/22/18, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i was being sarcastic lel
3/22/18, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: If you've had Operating Systems you could also just try out different things and program stuff in C instead of in Java
3/22/18, 10:27 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Just start coding some random program
3/22/18, 10:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Learn things as you go along
3/22/18, 10:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Worked for me
3/22/18, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Also C++ includes C so you can use whichever, C++ is more like java though (OO)
3/22/18, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: No worries! ^^
3/22/18, 10:42 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Thanks guys! I indeed had OS. Was hoping to find some sort of crash course in the C++ language and then wanted to start doing projects indeed
3/22/18, 10:44 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: id say just start ur project, or a simple one, and go trial and error
3/22/18, 10:45 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: that way you can watch more specific tutorials for the problems you encounter
3/23/18, 17:32 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Shouldn't there be slides of Tuesday's and maybe today's programming methods lectures on Canvas?
3/23/18, 17:35 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Were there lectures?
3/23/18, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: They are. Check in the files
3/23/18, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Okay, thanks!
3/24/18, 12:42 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Can somebody recommend a deepening course for next quartile? I already have two elective packages scheduled and one empty time slot for q4 so have no idea what to choose
3/24/18, 12:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: do you need next year linear algebra?
3/24/18, 12:44 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: because there is a crash course in it for  first year CS in q4, might be handy
3/24/18, 12:57 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You mean linear algebra and applications or linear algebra for data science?
3/24/18, 13:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: 2DBI00 linear algebra and applications I believe. @31642623926  can you confirm ?
3/24/18, 13:10 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I believe I have a crash with this one
3/24/18, 13:10 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: :c
3/24/18, 15:04 - ‪+40 728 617 862‬: guys is there a group for programming methods?

3/24/18, 18:07 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys, is anyone taking complex analysis, analysis 2 or intro to numerical computation?
3/24/18, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Run now you still can.
3/24/18, 18:08 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: ?
3/24/18, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: @31630168397 has done analyse 1,2, and 3 afaik
3/24/18, 18:08 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Analysis is hard as shit
3/24/18, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: I have done analysis 1 and 2 as well
3/24/18, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: I can describe it as pretty fucking hard
3/24/18, 18:09 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Is it really hard?
3/24/18, 18:09 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Oh okey got ya
3/24/18, 18:09 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Haha
3/24/18, 18:09 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Not my choice then, don’t really want to do a retake in August
3/24/18, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: But if you like maths, than it can be quite an interesting course
3/24/18, 18:11 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Damn the choice is hard
3/24/18, 18:11 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: There are so less courses for q4
3/24/18, 18:12 - Bas Gieling: if you take complex analysis youre gonna have the most amazing guy as lecturer tho
3/24/18, 18:12 - Bas Gieling: *oliver tse*
3/24/18, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: Can confirm
3/24/18, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: You could do process theory in q4
3/24/18, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: It starts next year
3/24/18, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: (So perhaps you can switch it with a course you planned for next year)
3/24/18, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Can confirm
3/24/18, 18:44 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I would do so but for next year q4 I only have final project
3/24/18, 18:44 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Complex analysis is also as hard as analysis 1,2 and 3?
3/24/18, 18:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Analysis 2 is easier than analysis 1 (more application than proving, but still a lot of proofs), and I heard of people taking it without the analysis 1 preknowledge
3/24/18, 18:48 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: This message was deleted
3/24/18, 18:50 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Don't know about complex analysis, apart from the amazing teacher, but the assumed preknowledge seems to hold a lot more than e.g. analysis 2
3/24/18, 18:51 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Alright got ya guys, thanks a lot! Saved me from taking a course which I would most surly fail
3/24/18, 20:57 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Guys does anyone know whether for DBL information systems we can choose teams on our own?

4/3/18, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Haha yes
4/3/18, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Although the app works fine
4/3/18, 11:10 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: it's up for me
4/3/18, 11:15 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: works fine for me too
4/3/18, 11:17 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: ... and now it works for me as well
4/3/18, 15:34 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Has anyone here had 2IC60 Computer networks and security already? If so, are the instructions/practicals mandatory?
4/3/18, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I have, do not think they are mandatory
4/3/18, 15:35 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Not 100% sure though
4/3/18, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 48019387‬: No, they are not
4/3/18, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 48019387‬: Fact :)
4/3/18, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Alright, thanks!
4/3/18, 15:41 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: And are the lectures useful?
4/3/18, 15:42 - ‪+31 6 48019387‬: Hmm, depends how good you are with absorbing information in big chunks 😃
4/3/18, 15:44 - ‪+31 6 48019387‬: I would advise to go still, because you can ask a question/get answer much quicker instead of circling or dwelling on the issue by yourself at home
4/3/18, 15:45 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Yeah, that's true. Thank you!
4/3/18, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: On osirisplanapp I just got a notification that DBL App Development (quartile 3) next year will have a modified time slot, it will now be in time slot D. This overlaps with Lab on offensive computer security. Are there other people who have the same problem?
4/3/18, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 30674224‬: 👋🏻

4/3/18, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Oh I read dbl algo
4/3/18, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 31192870‬: Same thing tbh
4/3/18, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: no
4/3/18, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: cuz dbl algo is probz gonna be in timeslot B
4/3/18, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 23080897‬: Same, but with buying behaviour and innovation
4/3/18, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Those of you who is taking DBL app development this quartile, do you know what exactly should final presentation cover?
4/3/18, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Goals of the app
Short design description
Demo (video or Android AVD or directly from the phone or tablet if you can...)
Reflection on the development process (what went well what didn't; any other observations)
Suggestions on the possible improvements for the course
4/3/18, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: @31628151420
4/3/18, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: _Suggestions on the possible improvements for the course_ from what I've gathered this point will have lots of suggestions lol
4/3/18, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: pretty random, but okay?
4/3/18, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: The course is pretty shit
4/3/18, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: All this stuff though. It's in one of the recent announcements on canvas
4/3/18, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Thank you
4/3/18, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: Did not realize there is announcement on canvas.
4/3/18, 19:40 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Is anyone else failing testSolveWithSimpleReasomer ?
4/3/18, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: In what way?
4/3/18, 19:40 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: I have 3 commands when the test wants 5 commands on stack
4/3/18, 19:41 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: I dont see why would there ever be a need for 5 commands to fill 4 fields
4/3/18, 19:41 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They want you to add commands of length 0 to the stack too I think
4/3/18, 19:41 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Hmm
4/3/18, 19:41 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Okay i will try
4/3/18, 19:43 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Actually I am adding them already
4/3/18, 19:43 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: I have one with length 0 and one with length 3
4/3/18, 19:45 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Then you may have forgotten to add some other commands somewhere or removed some that should have stayed on the stack?
4/3/18, 19:46 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: I add them all. I think its maybe wrong emptycellreasoner
4/3/18, 19:52 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Yea that was it.
4/3/18, 19:53 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: What did you do wrong there? I'm having the same issue
4/3/18, 20:23 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: My empty cell reasoner was wrong
4/3/18, 20:23 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: I think their comments are misleading
4/3/18, 20:24 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: You should iterate over all empty cells but you should return value after first empty cell found
4/3/18, 20:24 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: Then it passes the tests
4/3/18, 22:31 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: This message was deleted
4/3/18, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Does anyone know what the different modes in Programming Methods GA2 are for? It seems like the user should be able to edit the puzzle in edit mode, but that is not the case for me. I am wondering if that is because I did something wrong in some weird way?
4/3/18, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: It looked like most of the GUI functions weren't implemented by the teachers, there were a lot of not-filled-in // TODO's by them...
4/3/18, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: I think that functionality should not work, as it is on the todo list in the dummy package
4/3/18, 23:01 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Ah oke! Thought so! Wanted to be sure. Thanks! :)
4/4/18, 16:45 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is it correct that Programming Methods will not be in Q3 but in Q2 next year?
4/4/18, 16:53 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: It says so in the new curriculum
4/4/18, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Where did you find this :)?
4/4/18, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: You can find it on the website
4/4/18, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: <Media omitted>
4/4/18, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: And were we informed that this was going to happen, just to know before I start opening my mouth to Bloo
4/4/18, 16:55 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: You should check the colloquim slides for that I guess
4/4/18, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Are you kidding me 🧐
4/4/18, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I put programming methods in Q3 next year because I have the followup course in Q2 (wrong way around)
4/4/18, 17:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: So now I have both in Q2?
4/4/18, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Is it software engineering?
4/4/18, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/4/18, 17:03 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Because that course is a joke
4/4/18, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And not even a good one
4/4/18, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But now the programming methods quartile is suddenly gone
4/4/18, 17:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I don't think it'll be a big problem but I would've preferred 3-3 instead of 4-2 :p
4/4/18, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: What is the course code of the colloqium
4/4/18, 17:12 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Apparently Im not enrolled
4/4/18, 17:13 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: 2IC02
4/4/18, 17:14 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Thanks :)
4/4/18, 17:16 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Well, thats great now i also have 4-2 😕
4/4/18, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And do you also have web analytics like me?
4/4/18, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because now programming methods overlaps with that major course in timeslot
4/4/18, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: ..
4/4/18, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Took it this year already, so i got sorta lucky that way
4/4/18, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/4/18, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Yeah, like we have enough space to change our courses around at that point...
4/4/18, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Nope
4/4/18, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: This was my only way to puzzle without overlapping other courses
4/4/18, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/4/18, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Anyone has the course declarative Programming in their schedule? 
They suddenly moved quartile according to the planapp without any notification whatsoever
4/4/18, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh, I do!
4/4/18, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: It's Q1 time slot A now for whatever reason, so can't pick it anymore I guess 😑
4/4/18, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Roel trying to squeeze more money out of people for going too quickly
4/4/18, 17:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Prepare for the Fontys email recommendation
4/4/18, 17:26 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: They just randomly change course timings without checking for any correlation or overlapping with other courses I feel like
4/4/18, 17:28 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: That course than changed timeslots twice in 3 years
4/4/18, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: Then
4/4/18, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Well, this is proof that I fucked myself tho, shouldve been at that meeting
4/4/18, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Even if you was, how would you have changed it.. too little time imo
4/4/18, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: No, I could have chagned it
4/4/18, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: This was Q1
4/4/18, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes this was in Q1 Year 2, meaning that the puzzle we made as a schedule had already started
4/4/18, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Changing one course wouldv'e meant a chain reaction
4/4/18, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Might even have needed to change electives from first or second quartile
4/4/18, 17:41 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which was abundantly late at that point
4/4/18, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I get you guys' struggle, it sucks big time, however for me it wouldnt have been a problem
4/4/18, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Im just an idiot
4/4/18, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just play the part. I'll count you along the unlucky ones
4/4/18, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: I could have easily swapped 2 courses and have no problem, but Q3 is over now, so cant go back in time hahaha
4/4/18, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Nah
4/4/18, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Don
4/4/18, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: t
4/4/18, 17:42 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because the timeslot was not provided and you cannot assume them to overlap mandatory courses
4/4/18, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm not using your name ;)
4/4/18, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Ah alright than okay ;)
4/4/18, 17:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just some counter for people affected
4/4/18, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: <Media omitted>
4/4/18, 18:00 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Alright if they're gonna push that through I'll be unable to do one of my mandatory courses
4/4/18, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: That rule is bullshit though
4/4/18, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Everyone does it
4/4/18, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Agreed
4/4/18, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 17878796‬: They won't always push that through. If you really need to do 2 in the same timeslot you can even get like a quarantine-session if the exams are at the same time. Not recommended tho
4/4/18, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's gonna be a fucked up quartile already :(
4/4/18, 18:03 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Checked up on this at Roel and Yves. They said it was perfectly okay to do, but you may have some risk in overlap for an interim tests or some mandatory lecture. Those risks are your own problem when you have overlap, but you can prevent this by checking up with the schedule beforehand by asking the lecturer about it.
4/4/18, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Since when is the timeslot for programming methods for next year known?
4/4/18, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Because I did never see it before today
4/4/18, 18:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Only thing included in the kickoff slides is the change from Q3 to Q2
4/4/18, 18:09 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Anyone has DBL algorithms in the upcoming quartile??
4/4/18, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Yes me
4/4/18, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: Almost everyone lol
4/4/18, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 50582478‬: I think most people did that Q2
4/4/18, 18:17 - ‪+31 6 30168397‬: Ive Done this multiple times already
4/4/18, 18:23 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: If you need a group
4/4/18, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: yeah i do
4/4/18, 18:24 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Want to work together again? ;)
4/4/18, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Sure!
4/4/18, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: I've done this twice now
4/4/18, 18:36 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: And I'm doing it again next quartile
4/4/18, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Alright that settles my mind a bit
4/4/18, 22:48 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: I could tag along 👌🏻
4/4/18, 22:51 - Luke Houben: Same here actually🖐🏻

4/4/18, 23:33 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: You mean no-one is going to join them now and ask for them when they actually start the next quartile?
4/4/18, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Basically but still we have them
4/4/18, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: thanks Job :)
4/4/18, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Np
4/5/18, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: Not sure how many people also have 0HAUB0 USE next quartile?
4/5/18, 00:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If you mean 0ZAUB0 then yeah 🙋🏿‍♀
4/5/18, 00:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Oh wait
4/5/18, 00:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That’s 1ZAUB0 apparently

4/6/18, 12:16 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: does anyone know if the TU/e announced the switch of prometho to Q2 from Q3? If so when did they announce it
4/6/18, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Prometho?
4/6/18, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: programmingmethods
4/6/18, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It is (sadly) included in the slides of the kickoff meeting Q1 Year 2
4/6/18, 12:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Although they did not include the specific timeslot
4/6/18, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: aah alright, so a bit too late to complain I guess then :/ just got fucked over and realized Im doing 5 subjects next year Q2
4/6/18, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: oh boii
4/6/18, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: can't you fix 4 courses this quartile or is it too late for that?
4/6/18, 12:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: or do you already have 4
4/6/18, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: I already had 4 courses planned that quartile
4/6/18, 12:20 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: all of which ar eonly given in Q2
4/6/18, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: all forced?
4/6/18, 12:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: like you have to do em?
4/6/18, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: ur gonna have to go ask special permission for that son
4/6/18, 12:24 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: you cant just register for 5 subjects
4/6/18, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: was the limit really 4?
4/6/18, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: damn son
4/6/18, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yeah
4/6/18, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Only if you're doing 2 bachelors
4/6/18, 12:25 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: even if you do two bachelors you have to ask permission for a 5th subject
4/6/18, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: im not sure if they are even going to consider letting you do 5 subjects if you do just one bachelor
4/6/18, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but you could ask ofcourse
4/6/18, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: i mean depending on what subjects you are going to have it is possible
4/6/18, 12:26 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: possibly even doable
4/6/18, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: they're pretty lenient if it was they themselves who fucked you over in the first place though
4/6/18, 12:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: like what happened with BIS this quartile
4/6/18, 12:29 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Is one of them dbl algorithms?
4/6/18, 12:32 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: I am doing double bachelors and 5 courses this quartile but I havent asked permission to anyone. I just subscribed
4/6/18, 12:32 - Bas Gieling: uhm, this is not supposed to be possible
4/6/18, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 10866847‬: Yeah i know but like usual shit doesnt work 😅
4/6/18, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Yeah same here last quartile
4/6/18, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 46753206‬: Did 5 no complaints
4/6/18, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Löl get your shit together Osiris
4/6/18, 12:33 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: What, are you going to say that osiris is a broken piece of shit?
4/6/18, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: new planapp is going to roll out soon
4/6/18, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: that is, OsirisPlanApp2.0
4/6/18, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: but first to other faculties i believe
4/6/18, 12:34 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: guess they are scared since we were so critical last time
4/6/18, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: "oh no, actual feedback"
4/6/18, 12:41 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: Oh do I just email the faculty for that?
4/6/18, 12:42 - ‪+31 6 42876586‬: And nope
4/6/18, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Is there an active group of computer networks and security in the coming quartile?
4/6/18, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: the already is
4/6/18, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: scrool back fro the links
4/6/18, 16:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Or click "links"
4/6/18, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 43969749‬: It's called CNaS
4/6/18, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Got it
4/7/18, 02:40 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: Is there a Q3 "1ZSUC0 Organizing entrepreneurship" whatsapp group? Or someone here that got a hold of a proper digital version of the book? Need some figures and pages from it but it my version is not properly numbered and can't ctrl-f because the pdf are images and not text.

4/7/18, 02:42 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Should be correct
4/7/18, 02:42 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Dont know if ctrl f works though
4/7/18, 02:46 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: yest hat version, ctrl-f apparently works on 4 of the 528 pages.
4/7/18, 02:46 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: What are you looking for exactly
4/7/18, 02:46 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Because after every chapter
4/7/18, 02:47 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: There is a 1-2 page summary
4/7/18, 02:47 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Of that chapter

4/7/18, 02:47 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: You got special info
4/7/18, 02:47 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Thats the only pdf i have seen
4/7/18, 02:47 - ‪+31 6 14418848‬: Of the book
4/7/18, 02:48 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: figures I can find, but that still leaves a few pages I can't pinpoint in a wrongly numbered pdf.
4/7/18, 02:49 - ‪+31 6 34743945‬: book with correct page is on the drive
4/7/18, 02:49 - ‪+31 6 34743945‬: in the folder of the course
4/7/18, 02:49 - ‪+31 6 34743945‬: here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iyEIwi4en5zklE3ezwbkSBMRyTNI9gXD
4/7/18, 02:49 - ‪+31 6 34743945‬: is this what you are looking for?
4/7/18, 02:50 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: yes, ty
4/7/18, 02:51 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: Hadn't noticed yet there was a different version there.
4/7/18, 02:54 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: not really, using a summary from a friend that pointed towards the book a few times.
4/7/18, 02:58 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: seems to be the same version. ctrl-f works in google drive but not if you download it as pdf. 😢
4/7/18, 03:06 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: nvm I was still looking at the old document. I should probably go back to sleep. ty for the help guys. (P.S. sorry for this spam)
4/7/18, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Anyone have any tips on where to buy a domainname for cheap?
4/7/18, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: possibly including webhosting, not sure if i want that
4/7/18, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: just for some small websites of my own / experimenting
4/7/18, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Depends on the extension you want, like .com or .me
4/7/18, 15:16 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: You can get a free domain name with the Github student pack
4/7/18, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 47311973‬: I use OVH for webhosting+domain name
4/7/18, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Not free webhosting tho
4/7/18, 15:17 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: But renewal is expensive for that one
4/7/18, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Oh, don' t know about that
4/7/18, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Depending on the type of experimenting why even get a domain name?
4/7/18, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Just use the server ip if it's for personal use
4/7/18, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yeah, but where's the fun in that ;)
4/7/18, 15:23 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: You can host a simple static site via GH pages but if you want more control or use stuff like php or a database you can get basic hosting (2.40€/month at ovh, free domain for first year) if you also want Django or NodeJS or host some other services you have to look at a small VPS (also not too expensive 2.40€/month at ovh for example)
4/7/18, 15:24 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: @31646670518
4/7/18, 15:26 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Ovh sounds pretty good gonna look into that while i dont wanna study thanks! :p
4/7/18, 15:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: For VPS hosting, few can beat time4vps.eu
4/7/18, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 81710817‬: Actually same price for annually only price difference is when you want a shorter time, then time4vps becomes more expensive
4/7/18, 17:33 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Are there answers to the exam of April 2016 for data bases?
4/7/18, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Is there an easy way to count words in a LaTeX report?
4/7/18, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: are you using overleaf?
4/7/18, 21:06 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Yes

4/16/18, 22:37 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Thoughts?
4/16/18, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: sucks balls
4/16/18, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: online thing it does is increase the evening break, which we never need
4/16/18, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: what does decreasing the lunch break help for the lecture room shortages
4/16/18, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it does jack shit
4/16/18, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: "heavy use of streaming"
4/16/18, 22:38 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: If this is true, then I really don't care about the 10 hr thing at all
4/16/18, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: Not sure how they would define "heavy" though
4/16/18, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: true, but why would this 10 hour format help if all it does is decrease the break time pretty much
4/16/18, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Quick responses also mean 24-48 hours
4/16/18, 22:39 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: do the math :p
4/16/18, 22:41 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Maybe those 45 minuets are hard needed when you have 10th hour one day and 1st the next day
4/16/18, 22:42 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I really hate the fact that now not every lecture starts at x:45
4/16/18, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Not I have to take that also into account
4/16/18, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: yep.. it was so easy
4/16/18, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: 30 is free, 45 means start
4/16/18, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: at all times
4/16/18, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and the break was long enough to go to the center for whatever reason
4/16/18, 22:43 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Just upgrade your fucking internet abbo and let us stream
4/16/18, 22:44 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Ow wait they have a backbone of the internet so they don’t really have an excuse
4/16/18, 22:49 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
4/16/18, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: So does this mean that we again made  our planning for nothing?
4/16/18, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: good observation Job!
4/16/18, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I am really curious to what that'll mean indeed
4/16/18, 22:52 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No they'll just throw around the timeslots in the week probably
4/16/18, 22:52 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They say that D3 and B3 changed in the schedule
4/16/18, 23:05 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I think that the biggest mistake they are making here is that they are favoring less active students over active students, where "active student" means someone who is a member of a committee, a "medezeggeschapsorgaan", such as the FR, the UR or the SR, or is actively working on his career orientation by visiting lunch lectures or other career events. While the amount of less- or inactive students is significantly higher, I personally think that the active students are really vital to forming the active student community we have nowadays
4/16/18, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: A practical example is committe meetings, who are now mostly during lunch breaks, would not be possible, or at least a lot less effective
4/16/18, 23:07 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also important to note here is that I think that the student community is important for the TU/e to distinguish itself from the other universities in the Netherlands, and provide the feeling of being home and being accepted that, at least for me, was an important reason to go to the TU/e
4/16/18, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wow, again one of the few moments I can 100% agree with Rick
4/16/18, 23:08 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: on fire
4/16/18, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: But I do see a plusside to this
4/16/18, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Roel will now have to fit his kickoff's in 15 minutes less :p
4/16/18, 23:09 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: good luck
4/16/18, 23:10 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, this is in line with other decisions of the TU/e, like not hosting the OAJ anymore and it's dies natalis, which are pretty typical student traditions, because the university wants to turn into a typical American university
4/16/18, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Next step will probably being doing something to the intro week, which they have been doing for some years now, like discouraging traditions such as "doorhaal donderdag"
4/16/18, 23:13 - ‪+48 690 443 882‬: school shootings when
4/16/18, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's good for their annual revenue to turn American :p
4/16/18, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: that much I'll grant them
4/16/18, 23:15 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This is one of the reasons they are turning this way, it will get them quite a bit more money if they attract more students
4/16/18, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: wait, attracting more students? they wanted less right
4/16/18, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: there's not enough space already
4/16/18, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And especially in a certain category, who are attracted by a certain type of university
4/16/18, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: and they're creating selections
4/16/18, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: foreigners you mean
4/16/18, 23:16 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, students that meet certain criteria
4/16/18, 23:17 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Pfew I'm really happy that's after our generation. I got 6's tops in middle school
4/16/18, 23:18 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Same, but in a few years the realisation will set in that they really need the students who actually do stuff besides their studies, who actually need the 1.15 hour break
4/16/18, 23:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: few years? Dayumn.. nowadays that's a lot
4/16/18, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: I am happy with the fact that it is not the 12 hour system. But I do feel like if they optimize in other ways like streaming it would help a lot more than this
4/16/18, 23:22 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Didn't you guys know, the tue is trying to fetch more international money, all but 3 studies are english now and due to the numerus fixus a lot of non-dutch (eastern) europeans were dropped as they forgot to hand in their papers on time and failing the acceptence tests in general while asians / indians probably did way better.

Suspiciously asians pay 10.000 a pop while europeans "only" 2000

Internationals also don't care about student culture as most dont participate anyways.
4/16/18, 23:23 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Deepest tue lore
4/16/18, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: From what I understood the government in NL pays the remaining 8000 for each of us
4/16/18, 23:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or is that not true
4/16/18, 23:25 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Probably comes with way more strings attached though
4/16/18, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I think that your wording is a bit unecessarily harsh and a bit racist/discriminating, but especially your last sentence is something I think that the TU/e is forgetting, namely the student culture, which is a very integral part of Dutch student life
4/16/18, 23:26 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: And like bettina said, they get monies based on students grades
4/16/18, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Wait what did Storm say that was racist, or are you kidding :p
4/16/18, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, adressing certain racial groups isn't the nicest thing to do, and also not the smartest, given the events of past weeks
4/16/18, 23:28 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I think more internationals should get more involved with student culture, but our student culture is really focussed on dutch student culture so it kind of messes with the international university the tue wants to be
4/16/18, 23:29 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Yeah i should probs watch out
4/16/18, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Im in an international focussed culture association though so I should be fine for now👌🏻👌🏻
4/16/18, 23:30 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Completely agree, and I would also like to encourage international students who are following this discussion to join in the discussion, and also try joining the Dutch student life, which might seem intimidating, but is very open to people not familiar with the Dutch language in most cases
4/16/18, 23:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, I can say that at least some associations are actively working on becoming more friendly and open towards international students
4/16/18, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: have i missed something?
4/16/18, 23:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what are the events of the past weeks?

4/16/18, 23:35 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Did the group consist of easter europeans or did the group target them?
4/16/18, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I remember it being one of the two
4/16/18, 23:36 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, the members of the group were pretty homogenous
4/16/18, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: But the content being shared was mostly antisemitic and against people from middle eastern countries
4/16/18, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: damn alright
4/16/18, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: seems a bit like our spamchat

Really helped me out
4/18/18, 20:10 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Tactical dot .
4/18/18, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 53634447‬: Luna "closes" at 2 am. But the printer is still accessible.
4/18/18, 21:40 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: For all your late night printing needs
4/21/18, 00:01 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: <Media omitted>
4/21/18, 00:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Cellphone photo's are not even acceptable it says. That's the way I've been backing up all my handwritten notes for two years and it works clear as daylight.
4/21/18, 00:03 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is our teacher a dinosaur?
4/21/18, 00:04 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: yyeah cant we send another angry mail before we get weird stuff all over again?
4/21/18, 00:04 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: <Media omitted>
4/21/18, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Meh maybe just wait for the first lecture. If it's still weird at that point we'll ask for clarity
4/21/18, 00:05 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Seems like this happens each year, don’t think they just came with this idea for our year especially
4/21/18, 00:05 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm already happy that they do not ask for the actual paper version 😂
4/21/18, 00:06 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Exactly, so we'll see eventually :)
4/21/18, 00:06 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Imma gonna go cry anyway 🤷‍♂
4/21/18, 00:07 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That's your right as a student
4/21/18, 00:43 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: R mentioned, time to run
4/21/18, 08:12 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: For 2ID90. Is it correct that we don't have any lectures for that course next week? The lecture of Tuesday doesn't appear in my time table next week and friday there are no classes because of Kings day
4/21/18, 09:19 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Do you mean 2DI90? If so, same for me
4/21/18, 09:48 - ‪+31 6 30686090‬: There is a planner in Files on Canvas. It’s indicated there when we have lectures

4/21/18, 09:56 - ‪+40 740 200 106‬: Are there any whatsapp groups for q4?

4/21/18, 11:58 - ‪+31 6 42052325‬: They note using apps like Lens on your phone to "scan" the assignments is allowed, as long as it is legible
4/21/18, 16:38 - ‪+31 6 12224941‬: you can scan for free at any of the tu printers
4/21/18, 18:11 - ‪+31 6 18542302‬: This message was deleted

4/22/18, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Does someone here know if and how it possible to sync the office 365 / exchange people thingy with other email clients (like thunderbird). I can't really find anything on syncing the people's app with other services, and just importing / syncing contacts doesn't work
4/22/18, 16:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: <Media omitted>
4/22/18, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yeah I've synced my email and such but the people app doesn't seem to be synced
4/22/18, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: So if I don't have an tue email address in my contact list it doesn't auto search for it
4/22/18, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Which is a kinda neat feature to have
4/22/18, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Oh hmm
4/22/18, 16:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I just noticed as well
4/22/18, 17:17 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Is mytue down?
4/22/18, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Doesn't seem to work no
4/22/18, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: ytue.nl is all you need
4/22/18, 18:49 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: Any new whatsapp groups?

4/22/18, 20:42 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Guess you guys were too early
4/22/18, 20:45 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I should write a book: "The whatsapp search functionality and you" or "How to scroll up 10 messages to find the answer you're looking for"
4/22/18, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: This is honestly revolutionary
4/23/18, 10:34 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: is there a groupchat for introduction to computational science?
4/23/18, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: What is the course code?

4/23/18, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yep
4/23/18, 14:33 - Kevin Jilissen: No
4/23/18, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Android or iPhonehone ?
4/23/18, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: iPhone*
4/23/18, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: I had that from before the office365 migration
4/23/18, 14:33 - Kevin Jilissen: Android
4/23/18, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 44497802‬: Hmm alright well
4/23/18, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: What to do when you cannot login to every Tuesday website anymore just out of no where
4/23/18, 22:32 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: It says username or password is incorrect
4/23/18, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Tue website*
4/23/18, 22:33 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Try again in a couple minutes, I sometimes also have this out of the blue
4/23/18, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I already did
4/23/18, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I could login to osiris
4/23/18, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 44376992‬: Probably wait some 15mins, happens every once in a while
4/23/18, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: En then I couldn't login to any website anymore
4/23/18, 22:34 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Including Osiris again
4/23/18, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Your account may have been blocked
4/23/18, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Permanently?
4/23/18, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nah if it’s nothing important wait until tomorrow
4/23/18, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It’ll probably be fine then
4/23/18, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I’ve had that like 3 or 4 times already
4/23/18, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Solves itself every time
4/23/18, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Solved*
4/23/18, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: After how much time?
4/23/18, 22:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: No clue, sometimes 30 minutes but once it was a couple of hours I think
4/23/18, 22:52 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Not sure what causes it
4/23/18, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: If you mistype your password 3 times (ore once while configuring something like outlook or wifi which will keep trying) your account will be locked for 15 minutes
4/23/18, 22:54 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: I do not have a tue laptop but reinstalled my wifi drivers and then in happened
4/23/18, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: But I think I can login again
4/23/18, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ah ur laptop probably tried accessing the tue network with your computer credentials, which obviously don’t match your tue credentials
4/23/18, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: At least that’s what happened to me once
4/23/18, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: In the same situation
4/23/18, 22:55 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Probably config error in your wifi settings (defaults don't work always, you need to change some settings)
4/23/18, 22:56 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: https://intranet.tue.nl/universiteit/diensten/ict-services/hulp-en-ondersteuning/handleidingen/netwerk-services/connectivity-as-a-service/wifi-op-de-campus/
4/23/18, 22:57 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: The config should be described somewhere over there
4/23/18, 22:58 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: No it's fine now after waiting :)
4/23/18, 23:00 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Yes, but if ita your wifi settings which cause it it will just happen again once you're at the camput with your device
4/23/18, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Noo it's not
4/23/18, 23:06 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Pretty sure
4/24/18, 11:22 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: There is a kickoff meeting during the break today right? Someone that can tell me where this will take place?
4/24/18, 11:23 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Aud 1
4/24/18, 11:24 - ‪+31 6 57590265‬: ty
4/24/18, 14:04 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: is there a 2IC60 group?
4/24/18, 14:06 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: nvm got it
4/24/18, 14:20 - Bart van Dooren: It suddenly says in osirisplanapp and osiris itself that I am not registered for Q3 subjects anymore, is this normal? I did say so about 15 min ago untill I added an extra course in planapp due to some changes next year
4/24/18, 14:21 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Lemme check
4/24/18, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Same
4/24/18, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 31177227‬: Q3 courses aren't listed for me either in osiris anymore, so should be okay
4/24/18, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Makes sense tho, since Q3 is over
4/24/18, 14:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Waat?
4/24/18, 14:22 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Oh .. uhm ok
4/24/18, 14:22 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nee dimi
4/24/18, 14:23 - Bart van Dooren: ooh okay thanks guys, I never check osiris or planapp so was wondering if something went wrong
4/24/18, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: If you hadn’t mentioned it I would never have seen it 😂
4/24/18, 14:23 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They both should not be trusted anyway
4/24/18, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Only the registration email is legally binding according to Roel
4/24/18, 14:24 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Even though Osiris is supposed to be the only administrational app
4/24/18, 14:24 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: TU/error
4/24/18, 14:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: TU/ecnical difficulties
4/24/18, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Dude just stop please
4/24/18, 14:30 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: It makes perfect sense to not be registered anymore for a course you have finished
4/24/18, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: "finished"
4/24/18, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: True
4/24/18, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: we dont have grades for most courses so we dont actually know if we are done with the course
4/24/18, 14:31 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: At least officially, finished doesn’t mean passed 😂😂
4/24/18, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Yeah but then you’ll be automatically registered for the resit, so still nothing to worry about
4/24/18, 14:32 - ‪+31 6 34027520‬: 😂👌🔥💯
4/24/18, 14:33 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: pls don't do that here
4/24/18, 16:14 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: <Media omitted>
4/24/18, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: No spam please
4/24/18, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 20885116‬: Do you know where I can download InDesign? (No, googling "Tue InDesign" did not work)
4/24/18, 16:17 - Kevin Jilissen: https://intranet.tue.nl/universiteit/diensten/ict-services/hulp-en-ondersteuning/software-tue-werkplek/adobe-cc/
4/24/18, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I did the google and it worked
4/24/18, 16:25 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Whole adobe package download and then you can select which ones you need
4/24/18, 16:26 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Only possible on campus
4/24/18, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Or you can just download from adobe itself and then use the TU/e license update
4/24/18, 17:17 - Bas Gieling: how is it spam tho
4/24/18, 17:18 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: as it is unrelated advertisement, which we have not allowed in the past either
4/24/18, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Consistency, +1
4/24/18, 17:20 - Bas Gieling: unrelated to..?
4/24/18, 17:20 - Bas Gieling: its useful imo
4/24/18, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it's not directly related to course material, but rather recreational activities
4/24/18, 17:21 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: which is fine, just preferably not in this chat
4/24/18, 17:22 - Bas Gieling: hmm, alright
4/24/18, 18:22 - ‪+31 6 55500718‬: It's really not recreational since it is a nice skill that you can put on your resumé
4/24/18, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Addition to resumé: wannabe ID’er
4/24/18, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sounds really attractive
4/24/18, 19:10 - Joris Peters's security code changed. Tap for more info.
4/24/18, 19:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: Yes, but so are a lot of good conferences hosted in this city. But if we would post announcements about those things in this group it would drown out a lot of conversations about courses, or general study advice. Which is what this group is intended for. So it would be better suited to post this information in the other chat.
4/24/18, 22:49 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I think that especially in this group some interesting career related opportunities/conferences certainly can be highlighted, as long as it isn't something like the Aleph "De wil van een vrouw doet er #niettoe" party, I don't think anyone minds
4/24/18, 22:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Also, RE: the use of InDesign: if you ever need to make a nice looking document, LaTeX is not the way to go, and you want InDesign
4/24/18, 22:51 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: For example the NWERC sponsor document is made in InDesign
4/25/18, 10:37 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: Advertisements are just not what this group is for.. They are literally what I would label “spam”
4/25/18, 10:38 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: yeah but indesign is a tool not a skill, using indesign won't make your documents better if you can't even design to begin with
4/25/18, 10:39 - ‪+31 6 14549685‬: ugh chill its just one text post. been arguing if its spam or not for 2 days now. who cares... -_- arent you spamming atm by debating weather if its ad or not

4/25/18, 17:28 - Luke Houben: Maybe it was just a misclick

4/25/18, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: As long as we kill him swiftly we'll be able to assume guilty
4/25/18, 17:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: if you find him, i will threaten him and john will blow him up
4/25/18, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Look out with these kind of messages. Bettina does not like them
4/25/18, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: words can seriously break your bones nowadays because of butthurt causes

4/25/18, 17:31 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Just the fact that this is a real issue makes me sad.. :(

4/25/18, 17:33 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: What is that drive omg i didnt know about any drives. Can someone provide me with link about the drives we have for subjects ?

4/26/18, 10:01 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes, it is

He is not responding to our 2AC30 group so far
4/28/18, 15:18 - ‪+31 6 48019387‬: I know him very well, contacted him already
He was surprised since apparently he hasn't received any email or canvas notification 😳
4/28/18, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh I got a mail from a group member who got a reply from me and the fourth member, so maybe he wrote down the wrong email address for Rens?
4/28/18, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Could be. Can you give my number to Rens so he can contact me?
4/28/18, 15:21 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: oh nevermind he already did haha

4/28/18, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Mostly just inform your team and make sure to NOT do it again?
4/28/18, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: can happen once in a while
4/28/18, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 43157069‬: And do your work for the week
4/28/18, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: preferably a lot even before the meeting, so people can see that you're serious

5/4/18, 20:32 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Maybe but the curriculum is not gonna be the same probably so you'll need to do extra courses I guess
5/4/18, 20:36 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: And you will need to get trough the lottery
5/4/18, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: I think it is up to each lecturer (in this case in tue) to decide if you can get a exemption for each similar course you took at delft
5/4/18, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: At least it was like that for me
5/4/18, 20:49 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Like the lecturer of calculus gave an exemption based on me taking calculus in different uni
5/4/18, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Did you get the grade of the other university?
5/4/18, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: No grade on osiris, just says exemption
5/4/18, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Ahh
5/4/18, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: @31648187618 maybe you know? Although i never heard you mention such things
5/4/18, 23:02 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: daan knows it all
5/5/18, 00:04 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: To my understanding the bachelors are on paper just as different as two random other bachelors, and P's contain different knowledge and courses.

However, my experience with them was 3 years ago so not sure.

5/8/18, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: apart from that idk, they dont mention any breaches or stuff
5/8/18, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: which they should if that were the case
5/8/18, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: but would they if they should
5/8/18, 15:32 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: probably not :p
5/8/18, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: eh idk
5/8/18, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: its kinda against the law not to?
5/8/18, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or is that one not yet enforced?
5/8/18, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: “To ensure that nobody else has access to your information” could imply a breach
5/8/18, 15:33 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: In tue communication terms
5/8/18, 15:36 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: I'd just send them an email asking point blank whether there was a breach or not
5/8/18, 15:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Jort, you can write clear emails :p

5/8/18, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: What about like, already mentioning the reason in the initial email?
5/8/18, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: nah that wouldve been too easy man
5/8/18, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: He actually got a reply from them after just one email
5/8/18, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: That is quite the achievement
5/8/18, 16:56 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Even within the same week!
5/8/18, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: IT services are quite decent. They automatically make a ticket for issues you have, give you a trace number and all
5/8/18, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <insert name here>
5/8/18, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: “decent”
5/8/18, 16:57 - Kevin Jilissen: after the comma
5/8/18, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Oh then this is a self-managing entity within the TU/error
5/8/18, 16:57 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: dude, I obviously put that in as a joke as the original email just said dear,
5/8/18, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: yes it is
5/8/18, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: idk if just “dear,” is better tho
5/8/18, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: This is just a way too literal translation, since in Dutch "Beste," is a pretty valid addressing way for a letter
5/8/18, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: anyway, so if we dont change the password we wont be forced to but we simply lose access?
5/8/18, 16:58 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: it's the academic level clowns like Julian Schmaltz that trend to fail at communication
5/8/18, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: They didn't have the mandatory professional skills and peer reviews back in the day 😂
5/8/18, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes, in which case you probably need to go to ict services to get it sorted. And you don't want to meet those people
5/8/18, 16:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: rip
5/8/18, 17:00 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: And the queues at the service desk will be immense, since EVERYONE will have forgotten, probably
5/8/18, 17:36 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: How / where should you apply for your propedeuse if you got all the first year courses just now?
5/8/18, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: Osiris
5/8/18, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: https://osiris.tue.nl/osiris_student_tueprd/DiplomaAanvragen.do
5/8/18, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Should be here
5/8/18, 17:37 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Ahh thanks!
5/8/18, 17:38 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Do you actually need to have applied for a P be4 you can get your bachelor?
5/8/18, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: You have to get your P in order to start on your SEP
5/8/18, 17:39 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Ah, so i need to apply for it haha
5/8/18, 17:40 - ‪+31 6 50858649‬: Thanks
5/8/18, 17:46 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: I hope so, otherwise USE Ethics was truly useless.
5/8/18, 17:48 - Bart van Dooren: Does someone know how to change the password of the Tue laptop? Do I have to be at the Tue for this because it says domain controller unavailable
5/8/18, 17:49 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Is that even up for discussion? 😂
5/8/18, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: A fix for most issues is to install your own OS
5/8/18, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Hardly, but them not sticking to their own ethics talks is the last nail in the coffin for that course.
5/8/18, 17:50 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: True haha
5/8/18, 18:12 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: What do they mean with examenzitting when applying for your propedeuse?
5/8/18, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Ontging
5/8/18, 18:14 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Nothing*
5/8/18, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: The exam commission has to approve your propodeuse, that’s it afaik
5/8/18, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: You don’t have to be ther
5/8/18, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: There
5/8/18, 18:15 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: In fact, ur not even invited to the party
5/8/18, 18:18 - ‪+31 6 34642931‬: Ah okay thnx

5/8/18, 18:28 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Then he's ahead, I only got 2.
5/8/18, 18:29 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: It wasn't sent to my TU/e email address, but to a different one (which I think I used when signing up for the study)
5/8/18, 18:31 - ‪+31 6 42877931‬: Yeah they must’ve messed up when trying to send the research project email
5/8/18, 18:32 - ‪+31 6 50889435‬: Messed up _several times?_
5/8/18, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: could this be considered a spam message?

5/9/18, 07:46 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: @31643470096 not necessary
5/9/18, 13:07 - ‪+31 6 10765957‬: Full disclaimer: I'm doing my internship at Secura.

If you are interested in security and hack for fun (like me), I have a great way for you to show off your hacking skills: participate in the Secura student CTF! You can form groups of up to four students and the winners get 2048, 1024 xor 512 euros. Officially, the registration period are over but TUe students can still sign up this week :) More info at https://www.secura.com/ctf .

5/9/18, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Please next time send this is the spam chat
5/9/18, 13:12 - ‪+31 6 10765957‬: Sorry, I wasn't aware of its existence
5/9/18, 13:13 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: We already discussed this before.    extra curricular activities are not part of the core study so either if you really think it is related ask Jort Luke or me beforehand and will discuss  and let you know if it is allowed or send it in the spam chat
5/9/18, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: Can we not set up some kind of advertisements chat? People might be interested in stuff like this and the spamchat hardly seems the place to look for this kind of information?
5/9/18, 13:46 - ‪+31 6 37270737‬: Or just allow it here, but that doesnt seem to be up for discussion

5/9/18, 15:57 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: for anyone taking the course "Introduction to Computational Science": The lecturer sent us an email stating that we have to hand in something monday, details would be given in the studyguide. The study guide, however, just says "Deadling Practical work week 1". What even is this practical work? lol
5/9/18, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 28377200‬: Last year it were Matlab assignments
5/9/18, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 54918944‬: if you mean the course 2WN50 it is: 

Chapter 1 – 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, 17, 18, 21, 34, 35, 40, 41, 42
5/9/18, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 54918944‬: not Deadling Practical work week 1 but Deadling Practical work chapter 1 it says :)
5/9/18, 17:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: right, thanks
5/9/18, 17:53 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Does anyone know if the ICT services are open tomorrow?
5/9/18, 17:55 - ‪+31 6 11753688‬: The whole uni is closed
5/9/18, 18:01 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Well, that sucks. I fucked up big time by locking myself out of my laptop and now I can't access anything TUe related...
5/9/18, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: rip
5/9/18, 18:38 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how?
5/9/18, 18:39 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Indeed, how
5/9/18, 18:42 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I am ashamed to say this as a cs student, but I changed my password to something randomly generated, stored it in secure software such that I don't have to remember it just yet and turned down my pc, forgetting the windows login is also changed because of that.
5/9/18, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Looool
5/9/18, 18:43 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That sucks
5/9/18, 18:44 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: rip cas
5/9/18, 18:45 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: :')
5/9/18, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 24533109‬: Haha löl
5/9/18, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Eh
5/9/18, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Is that your only laptop?
5/9/18, 18:46 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Like, you don’t have a separate desktop or something?
5/9/18, 18:53 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Can you still access your tue mail from some device?
5/9/18, 19:14 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Nope, that is the problem. I did not set up the email on my phone yet. So I can't use the recovery options.
5/9/18, 19:16 - ‪+31 6 20156447‬: Rip
5/9/18, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: Https://access.tue.nl
5/9/18, 20:12 - ‪+31 6 81537496‬: You can reset your password from there
5/9/18, 20:18 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: damn that seems like something I would do too
5/9/18, 20:19 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: but you can call the tue when they're open and they'll probably don't give a damn
5/9/18, 20:28 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: True, not the biggest problem in the world, but then I have to wait till monday, which sucks.
5/9/18, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I tried that, but never received an e-mail on my personal account
5/9/18, 20:29 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: If you have a live usb with you you can copy the database file and unlock it on another pc.
5/9/18, 20:39 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: let's hope he hasn't encrypted his drive
5/9/18, 20:40 - ‪+31 6 37340548‬: I would say it is quite unlikely that the drive is encrypted, but let's hope so for him.
5/9/18, 20:41 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Otherwise he should just hack his computer as that's what my mom thinks software science is about
5/9/18, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I don't, but I also don't have a live USB lying around unfortunately.
5/9/18, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: I'll just do this then. How could I not have thought about that before?!
5/9/18, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Thanks for the suggestions at least!
5/9/18, 23:55 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Does anyone know if it's possible to use the laser cutter on the TU/e? (if you're not an ID student)
5/9/18, 23:56 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: i think it is written somewhere that only id and some masters can use it. But you can always try and  bribe an Id student to do it for you
5/9/18, 23:57 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: <Media omitted>
5/9/18, 23:59 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: Hmm alright thanks!
5/10/18, 00:02 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: There are also other laser cutters on the campus
5/10/18, 00:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: For example there are multiple in vertigo
5/10/18, 00:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Those are for bouwkunde students
5/10/18, 00:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Btw if you dont mention you're not an ID student they probably won't do a background check
5/10/18, 00:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: And if you use the bouwkunde one you can just ask any of the students there if you can requesr it through them
5/10/18, 00:08 - ‪+31 6 41261514‬: That sounds doable, I'll take a look
5/10/18, 09:50 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: this is exactly what my brother said
5/11/18, 16:34 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: can someone post the link to the 2IC60 chat?
5/11/18, 16:37 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: https://chat.whatsapp.com/5X1nG0s21CYIRNkKVyN1h7

Could you text me once you’ve joined ?
5/11/18, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 46670518‬: Sure thanks
5/12/18, 20:03 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: how can i check the ID of a student. i need Rick Wouters ID so i can submit the comp networs essay assignment thingy... but he isn't on his phone i assume
5/12/18, 20:24 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Try the webmail and then search for Rick
5/12/18, 20:25 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Ok iwill thanks
5/12/18, 20:54 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Or call him, thats a thing ya know?
5/12/18, 20:54 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Didnt pick up
5/12/18, 20:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: But eveeything is solved now
5/12/18, 20:55 - ‪+359 88 639 2842‬: Thanks 🐻
5/12/18, 20:57 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: He's away with GEMOLD afaik, the gewis version of wie is de mol so no communication is allowed
5/12/18, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I am there as an assistant :p
5/12/18, 20:58 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: So communication is allowed
5/12/18, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I only was in a forest without my phone
5/12/18, 20:59 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: (p.s. I didn't get raped)
5/12/18, 21:05 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Ah
5/12/18, 22:16 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sad
5/12/18, 22:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: shame
5/13/18, 09:46 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: 🐢
5/13/18, 11:00 - ‪+31 6 42007885‬: Keep it civilized @31642623926  @31643470096  @31621372984
5/13/18, 11:14 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Just stating some facts
5/13/18, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so
5/13/18, 15:59 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: for anyone taking introduction to computational science:
5/13/18, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm trying to solve question 42 of chapter 1
5/13/18, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
5/13/18, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what am i doing wrong?
5/13/18, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: if anyone else knows please let me know too
5/13/18, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: I'm trying to approximate the value of sin(x) with the taylor series of sin
5/13/18, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: a is the term im adding to the sum next
5/13/18, 16:00 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: S is the sum
5/13/18, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: and E is the relative error, if E reaches 0.000001 the loop should stop
5/13/18, 16:01 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: somehow, this function gets nowhere close to the real value of sin
5/13/18, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: What are you using?
5/13/18, 16:03 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Which language/program
5/13/18, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: matlab
5/13/18, 16:04 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: First time using matlab or no?
5/13/18, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: well, ive been using it since this quartile
5/13/18, 16:05 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so no, this is not the first program ive written but it is the first course ive had to use it for
5/13/18, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: There might be something going wrong with your operations, you have standard * but in some cases you should use .* and vice versa
5/13/18, 16:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: * is a matrix operation and .* Real number operation or smth like that (pls don't kill me matlab wizards)
5/13/18, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: There are no matrixes in this program so you shouldn't have to use .*
5/13/18, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yeah i was gonna say this is the other way around
5/13/18, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: .* is a matrix operation
5/13/18, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: * is matrix multiplication, .* Is elementwise matrix multiplication
5/13/18, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I did comp sci last year so I don't remember too well, sorry
5/13/18, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: how about just.. normal numbers tho
5/13/18, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: like, 2*65
5/13/18, 16:08 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: Then they both give the same result
5/13/18, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so it shouldnt matter whether i use .* or *
5/13/18, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: Yeah
5/13/18, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so.. see any problems with my function?
5/13/18, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: you're just doing S += a right?
5/13/18, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yes
5/13/18, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: S = Sold + a is the same as S = S + a
5/13/18, 16:11 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: since I just set Sold to the value of S
5/13/18, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: right now it approximates sin(65) at 7.6054e+10 while it is in fact just 0.9063
5/13/18, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so.. what the hell
5/13/18, 16:12 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: I believe your a is wrong
5/13/18, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it is, i just changed it
5/13/18, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: it was in the picture at least
5/13/18, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i changed it to this:
5/13/18, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: <Media omitted>
5/13/18, 16:13 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: theres a lot of redundant brackets there but they help me understand the function better
5/13/18, 16:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: E = ((S+a)-S/(S+a)) = abs(a) / (S+a) right?
5/13/18, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: no, Sold is the S without a
5/13/18, 16:16 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so E = ((S+a)-S)/S
5/13/18, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: |((S+a)-S)/S|
5/13/18, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: =|a/S|

5/13/18, 16:17 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: I know i'm doing some retarded things but I just want to see what your complete function does
5/13/18, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: yea
5/13/18, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i mean that doesnt really change anything, and the question states it like this
5/13/18, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: so thats why i put it that way
5/13/18, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 54682617‬: Where do we hand it in actually?
5/13/18, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: during the instruction tomorrow
5/13/18, 16:19 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: you have to actually write/print it all out and hand it to him in a bundle

5/13/18, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: heres the full question btw, maybe im missing something?
5/13/18, 16:20 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: You should actually get an error on your first run, since you divide by zero🤔
5/13/18, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: do i though?
5/13/18, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: But the mistake is in the question x is in radians
5/13/18, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: i divide by factorial((2*n)+1) = factorial((2*0)+1) = 1
5/13/18, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: oh hang on
5/13/18, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: In your error formula
5/13/18, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: with the E you mean
5/13/18, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: The first Sold is zero
5/13/18, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck me sideways
5/13/18, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 13891416‬: 65 radians is to far from 0 to give accurate taylor
5/13/18, 16:22 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: why do theY GIVE THE FUCKING TAYLOR SERIES EXPANSION IN RADIANS IF THEY WANT US TO DO IT IN DEGREES
5/13/18, 16:23 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: what the hell
5/13/18, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: that fixed it
5/13/18, 16:24 - ‪+31 6 21372984‬: fuck

5/14/18, 08:03 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: otherwise make sure you're registered for them
5/14/18, 08:05 - ‪+31 6 29972436‬: The thing is, I will be automatically registered if I fail, but the grades are not online yet. And I kind a need to know when the resit is already just in case that I have to take the resit.
5/14/18, 08:17 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: in that case you might be able to find the information on the course's canvas page

5/16/18, 12:48 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: That’s weird

5/16/18, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: Haha
5/16/18, 12:49 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: I tried to add my personal outlook account to it as well. But then outlook ended up with two different 'trash' folders, and it couldn't handle that
5/16/18, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Hmm strange
5/16/18, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I have two mail accounts running on it as well, works like a charm
5/16/18, 12:50 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: For my parents there’s even 3
5/16/18, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: For me it completely freaked out when I added the second one
5/16/18, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 24797029‬: But oh well
5/16/18, 12:51 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Sounds like something it could do 🤔

5/16/18, 15:56 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Are there more people here whose laptops won't go into sleep mode anymore whilst being plugged in after the battery change? Mine will not go into sleep mode when I close the lid, press the sleep button or do it via windows menu whilst the power adapter is plugged in. According to the settings it should do so but it doesn't. It just blacks the screen out but keeps running and when you press a key/use the mousepad it the screen just lights up again.
5/16/18, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 40998750‬: even after waiting for a few secs?
5/16/18, 16:07 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Yup
5/16/18, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: It's rather fucking annoying because it looks like it's going into sleepmode and then I put it in my bag and because it is still running it gets really hot.. And the battery got replaced because it was a fire hazard but this is an even bigger hazard imho lol
5/16/18, 16:18 - ‪+31 6 24553225‬: that happened to me a few times as well, but idk how, it just randomly stopped doing that after applying updates and restarting the pc
5/16/18, 16:21 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: I've had this issue ever since the battery was changed like 1.5 months ago. Everything (inc bios) is fully uptodate but the issue persists
5/16/18, 16:28 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: Go to ur power settings
5/16/18, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I vaguely remember there being settings for such things
5/16/18, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: There are
5/16/18, 16:29 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: And they all say the laptop should go to sleep

5/18/18, 13:01 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: eh, might also be that you have to use ur email

5/18/18, 18:02 - ‪+31 6 11804442‬: I believe logging in on the mail server in a browser should fix it

5/18/18, 21:09 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: does anyone know if there will be a solution to the timeslot problem of webanalytics and programming methods next year q2?
5/18/18, 21:11 - ‪+31 6 43222030‬: Afaik @31648187618 has already asked Bloo about this so that they can try and fix it with the exams or something like that? Afaik the lectures will just stay as is and you'll have to choose which ones to attend
5/18/18, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: Because we only have till 2020 to finish our bachelor right?😅
5/18/18, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 81646972‬: Slightly troublesome if i have to postpone programming methods😂
5/18/18, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: There won't be a solution, you can ask for quarantine for the exams if they are on the same day
5/18/18, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 36467748‬: Afaik
5/18/18, 23:12 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Yes I have been quite clear about that with both Roel and Yves in person and via email.

It is our own fault for not taking programming methods in Year 2, even though the plannings rarely not allow that and they schedules those two mandatory major courses in the same timeslot.

But that fuckup of theirs aside, they will not let the exams be in the same timeslot. And even if they do, we'll be fine through individual arrangements I'll enforce through the exam committee if need be.
5/18/18, 23:14 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I'm pretty sure they are aware of the stupidity of the matter, considering their responses are quite defensive instead of denying
5/18/18, 23:21 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Programming methods = software engineering, right?
5/18/18, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No, programming methods iirc is gonna be in Q2 next year
5/18/18, 23:37 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: And directly overlaps with web analytics, which is mandatory for some of us as well
5/18/18, 23:38 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Software engineering is also in that quartile

5/22/18, 09:37 - ‪+31 6 14538949‬: Hi everyone, 
The programme director for Mathematics and Computer Science, Marloes van Lierop, has asked me to remind everyone who is interested, to register for the Alumni Speed Dating event. She feels that this would be a great opportunity for everyone to talk to alumni who have offered their time to help guide students in their future decisions such as which masters they would want to take or what jobs are out there for computer science students. Registration closes tomorrow at midnight and is open to all second year and third-year computer science students. The link is: https://goo.gl/forms/K6D1M27Xhj0LB2ve2. If you have any other questions please contact me directly and not through this WhatsApp page so that no unnecessary spam is created for the rest.

5/22/18, 09:39 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: nah, this all good
5/22/18, 09:40 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, given the fact that Anne's awesome telescopes were spam, this certainly is spam
5/22/18, 09:41 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: This is useful for students stuff, don’t agree with you Rick
5/22/18, 09:41 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: If everything that is useful for students is allowed, then this is gonna be one hell of a spam stream
5/22/18, 09:45 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: This is directly related to our study and is organised by our department
5/22/18, 09:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I'd say that the department has its own channels for that ;)
5/22/18, 09:46 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: At least, I hope so
5/22/18, 09:46 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: As if i Read email
5/22/18, 09:50 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Well, at least now you're able to go on a date, Storm
5/22/18, 09:51 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Nah they'll find a way to reject me
5/22/18, 21:14 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: So for all people that took dbl app development last quartile, are we never going to get our grades? This is getting ridiculous..
5/22/18, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: Daan to the rescue
5/22/18, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: In this case it was mainly due to serious private issues for the lecturer and the fact that he was way too lenient to tutors that failed to deliver peer review
5/22/18, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You have more information?
5/22/18, 21:15 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: It's annoying as fuck but considering this is a DBL I would not worry too much
5/22/18, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: it's insta-pass if you did your part
5/22/18, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You know anything about if the grades are coming any time soon?
5/22/18, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: No details, but it's not the case that the lecturer is being lazy
5/22/18, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I assume they are
5/22/18, 21:16 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: not sure
5/22/18, 21:20 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: The message he sent about not having the peer reviews of some people also doesn't really help if he doesn't specify the people he is still missing those peer reviews from since the tutors are incompetent
5/22/18, 21:21 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Also no deadline for that was set either, hence people could still be handing them in
5/22/18, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: It also has to dop with the tutor of my group, and one other group disappearing and not handing in the peer assesment form things. Thus we had to to that manually
5/22/18, 21:25 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: afaik all my group members have handed it in, but I can't speak for the other group that was subjected to the same tutor as ours
5/22/18, 21:35 - ‪+31 6 36541943‬: Other group also handed it in
5/23/18, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: TURTLEMAN
5/23/18, 23:27 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: I DEMAND EXPLANATION

5/24/18, 09:42 - Bas Gieling: afaik this is still all we know
5/24/18, 09:54 - ‪+31 6 26223821‬: 😔 oh this course...
5/24/18, 21:44 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: App dev is finally here
5/24/18, 21:45 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Woopwoop
5/24/18, 21:52 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Since when do the people of Osiris work in the evening?
5/24/18, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Supposedly it is an automated system
5/24/18, 21:57 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Which makes it even weirder that it seems to stop Friday around 17:30
5/24/18, 22:06 - ‪+31 6 29323398‬: No work on Sundays Daan!
5/24/18, 22:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: "supposedly"

5/29/18, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: You can tutor me starting Q1 next year for some easy courses
5/29/18, 14:40 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Might be wrong tho

5/29/18, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 21963083‬: Also depends on how many ECTS you have
5/29/18, 14:40 - ‪+40 740 200 106‬: It says here how much per hour
5/29/18, 14:40 - ‪+31 6 48019387‬: Depends on the amount of ects / years you have completed
5/29/18, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Will do
5/29/18, 14:41 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thanks
5/29/18, 14:42 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Im serious

5/29/18, 14:58 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: about 11 - 12 - 13 euros an hour depending on the 60 / 120 / 180 ects
5/29/18, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: Calculus 😅, datamodelling q afterwards
5/29/18, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Ahh😂
5/29/18, 15:27 - ‪+31 6 10720282‬: They try not to assign tutors to students from the same major for calculus
5/29/18, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 10770524‬: I meant 1 on 1 @31681422900 @31610720282
5/29/18, 16:09 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Iknow

5/30/18, 10:25 - ‪+31 6 83228337‬: Try with tue/ in front of s number
5/30/18, 10:26 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Thanks
5/30/18, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or TUE\
5/30/18, 10:29 - ‪+31 6 43470096‬: or s....@tue.nl
5/31/18, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Is there a chat for PaS?
5/31/18, 14:48 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Also for 2b should we assume a day is any 24 hour interval?
5/31/18, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 23837581‬: yes
5/31/18, 14:49 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: Aha thanks
5/31/18, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: So the chance that the interval being exactly 24 once and never greater than that?
5/31/18, 14:52 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I think the chance of the interval being \geq 24 at exactly one time
5/31/18, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Or
5/31/18, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Hmm
5/31/18, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: No, I think you're right
5/31/18, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: If it is greater you already have more than 1 occurance
5/31/18, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: You're wasting resources Rick
5/31/18, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: or does \geq do more than \ge
5/31/18, 14:53 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: Yes, just realised that as well
5/31/18, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 42623926‬: I like the consistency, @31648187618 , or does \le do the same as \leq?
5/31/18, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: I never use \leq and \geq
5/31/18, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Did not know they existed when I started using \ge and \le :p
5/31/18, 14:54 - ‪+31 6 48187618‬: Are these both exactly the same?
5/31/18, 14:59 - ‪+31 6 19855736‬: I have no idea how to calculate that though
5/31/18, 17:18 - ‪+40 728 617 862‬: hey, the "This exercise will not be graded" next to exercise 8 in the PS homework implies I can still get the 2 points for attempting all exercises even if I don't do it?
5/31/18, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: That's computer networks and securty
5/31/18, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Not probability
5/31/18, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: wrong course
5/31/18, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: Probability you just get points for the selected exercises
5/31/18, 17:19 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You also get some points for attempting
5/31/18, 17:19 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: For probability
5/31/18, 17:19 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: 2 to be exact
5/31/18, 17:19 - ‪+31 6 81422900‬: You do not
5/31/18, 17:19 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: And other 8 come from 4 exercises
5/31/18, 17:20 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Wasn’t it?
5/31/18, 17:20 - ‪+40 728 617 862‬: yea that is what I knew too
5/31/18, 17:20 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I also thougt that this was only for computer networks
5/31/18, 17:20 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Oh right, sorry you correct
5/31/18, 17:21 - ‪+40 728 617 862‬: okay then, that s good news thank yoou
5/31/18, 17:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: So if you simply don’t do 8 you still can get a 10?...
5/31/18, 17:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Kinda strange considering the fact that they do not give any feedback on the exercises that are not graded
5/31/18, 17:21 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: What’s even a point to submit this exercise then?...
5/31/18, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: I'm not 100% sure but I guess
5/31/18, 17:22 - ‪+31 6 21606619‬: Maybe it's somewhere in the course description
5/31/18, 17:22 - ‪+40 728 617 862‬: for the ones that are really eager to learn?:))
5/31/18, 17:23 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I didn’t say there is no point of doing it 
I said no point of submitting as you don’t get feedback for the exercises that are not graded :)
5/31/18, 17:25 - ‪+40 728 617 862‬: okay then that is a really good question..
5/31/18, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: because he provides the solutions to the questions
5/31/18, 17:25 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: so you can verify if you understand some of the key concepts of the course
5/31/18, 17:26 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: You still get solutions and can verify your work without submitting it tho :P
5/31/18, 17:27 - ‪+31 6 28151420‬: some prefer to think about problems first rather than immediately resorting to the solutions :P
5/31/18, 17:27 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: I am no saying let’s not do or submit this exercise I just find it’ strange and wanted to point it out
5/31/18, 17:28 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Yes, again, I said not submitting 
No submitting does not implying not doing the exercises
5/31/18, 17:29 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Maybe I just miss society part of the USE 👨🏻‍🏫
5/31/18, 17:29 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: Philosophic questions ahahah
5/31/18, 17:29 - ‪+7 985 341-22-64‬: (Sorry for spam)
