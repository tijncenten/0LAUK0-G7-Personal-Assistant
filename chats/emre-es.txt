06/03/2016, 08:59 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: I did had one idea to prevent disks from flipping while loading. The disks have holes in the middel, so if we are allowed to temporarely hold some sort of long stick in the tube while loading. All disks will land on top of each other and wont flip. And after loading the user can remove the stick againg. With stick I mean something like a Satay skewer(saté prikker)|1

27/03/2016, 14:05 - Emre Aydogan: Sorry that i couldnt attend today's meeting|0
27/03/2016, 14:05 - Emre Aydogan: I seriously just returned from the store|0
27/03/2016, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 40231202‬: Not a problem|0
27/03/2016, 14:05 - ‪+971 56 740 6641‬: No problem
We didn't do anything productive|0
27/03/2016, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 40231202‬: Only thing we said|1
27/03/2016, 14:05 - ‪+31 6 40231202‬: Let's meet this Sunday|1
27/03/2016, 14:06 - Emre Aydogan: Okay ^^|0
28/03/2016, 16:41 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: do we want the display to be written on at a fixed interval or at certain points in the main loop? ie: when we update the amount of black disks|1
28/03/2016, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 40231202‬: I would say black and white all the time?|1
28/03/2016, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 40231202‬: And the state changes|1
28/03/2016, 16:47 - ‪+31 6 40231202‬: If that's possible?|1
28/03/2016, 16:48 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: Thats nog gonna work, then the fixed time write will sometimes interfear with the other write or the other wat around|1
28/03/2016, 16:49 - ‪+31 6 40231202‬: So displaying everything all the time is impossible?|1
28/03/2016, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: You need tot switch between all the digits really fast, but if you where to for example write at constant intervals the amount of black and white but the state change only when it actually occurs, it might happen that they both want to write at the same time but to two different digits. Thats when things will go wrong|1
28/03/2016, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 40231202‬: And just keep de state on all the time|1
28/03/2016, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: So either everything at fixed interval or everything when it happens|1
28/03/2016, 16:51 - ‪+31 6 40231202‬: And update it when it changes|1
28/03/2016, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: I would say fixed interval, but i dont know how you guys think about it|1
28/03/2016, 16:52 - ‪+31 6 40231202‬: Like black white changes when they get sorted|1
28/03/2016, 16:54 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: Nvr mind, i think One of them will not look good because they will not all be written to equally and thus the intensity wil change between the digits.|1
28/03/2016, 17:30 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: <Media omitted>|1
28/03/2016, 17:31 - ‪+971 56 740 6641‬: haha|0

31/03/2016, 13:11 - ‪+31 6 44458351‬: And in the next loop it will "know" that the button was pressed|1
31/03/2016, 13:17 - ‪+31 6 44458351‬: Are you sure that you are using the newest version of the Java program? It looks old.|1

03/04/2016, 11:20 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: i've been testing the code on the emulator and found that when you keep the button pressed it will regester it and stop after it registered it twice. the problem is not that it doesnt register, the problem is that is doesnt check the button frequently enough. ill try to make it so that it checks more often|1
03/04/2016, 11:25 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: oh and im not gonna sail the whole weekend, at most only tomorrow|1

06/04/2016, 17:58 - Emre Aydogan: But what works and what doesnt right now Laurence?|1
06/04/2016, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 44458351‬: How is it going?|1
06/04/2016, 17:58 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: The counter should now work|1
06/04/2016, 17:59 - ‪+971 56 740 6641‬: I dont understand why we need a java doc|0
06/04/2016, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 40231202‬: I'll join you laurence|1
06/04/2016, 17:59 - ‪+971 56 740 6641‬: its extremely similar to the UPPAAL model|1
06/04/2016, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: But still have to look at the abirt button|1
06/04/2016, 17:59 - ‪+31 6 44458351‬: I might stay after but I'd like to sleep in. My weekend sucked|0
06/04/2016, 18:01 - Emre Aydogan: Okay Laurence can you post a version of the latest .asm to droobox|1

06/04/2016, 18:03 - Emre Aydogan: Okay sure|0
06/04/2016, 18:03 - Emre Aydogan: That part isnt urgent right now anyway|0
06/04/2016, 18:04 - Emre Aydogan: Then all I need is for someone to write a coding standard paragraph for the Software Implementation document|1
06/04/2016, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: Had some time and uploaded it|1
06/04/2016, 18:07 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: Its draftV1.2|1

06/04/2016, 18:08 - Emre Aydogan: Thanks 👍|0
06/04/2016, 19:35 - Emre Aydogan: Laurence I need to write something about us 'testing' the assembly code and encountering errors and how we fixed those errors.|1
06/04/2016, 19:36 - Emre Aydogan: Can you give me some examples of error you found and briefly say how you fixed them|1
06/04/2016, 19:36 - Emre Aydogan: For example the motors going crazy when sorting a white disc|1
06/04/2016, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: fixed that by changing a bit pattern that was wrong for the output, the counter thingy not counting fixed by lowering a timer (the timer determinds when the button may be pushed again), wrong motors running fixed also by changing bit pattern, to much power draw, fixed by moving light from output 1 to 7|1
06/04/2016, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: if you need more i can send more, but this is what i can remember in 5 sec|0
06/04/2016, 19:39 - ‪+31 6 49652138‬: Black disc were sorting faster than the white discs last week|1
06/04/2016, 19:40 - ‪+31 6 14375335‬: i think thats because of the disks landing closer to the black basket and i dont thing the code has anything to do with it|1
06/04/2016, 19:50 - Emre Aydogan: Okay thanks|0
06/04/2016, 21:02 - Emre Aydogan: I need to answer the question: How do we use memory, the stack and are some registers reserved for certain operations?|1
