12-09-17 10:31 - Joost: Could you print my HWA for me? That would be very helpful 😀. The document is on drive|1
12-09-17 10:31 - Luke: Hahaha Yeah thats possible|1
12-09-17 10:31 - Joost: Thx!|0
12-09-17 10:32 - Natalia: My printer refused to work today, so I took a laptop again 🙈|1

12-09-17 16:34 - Luke: This is the agenda for next week|1
12-09-17 16:34 - Luke: Someone wanna add something ?|1
12-09-17 16:53 - Hannes: Think its alright|1
12-09-17 16:56 - Luke: Do I also have to mail this to Nienke|1
12-09-17 17:44 - Hannes: I didnt|1
12-09-17 17:44 - Hannes: She didnt mentioned it aswell in the meeting so i guess you dont have to|1
12-09-17 21:09 - Hannes: How late were we going to meet tomorrow? @31634647614 @31636488574|1
12-09-17 21:15 - Roos: Half ten in meta right?|1
12-09-17 21:16 - Hannes: yes but i wasn’t sure|1
13-09-17 09:22 - Joost: Im at metaforum|1
13-09-17 09:25 - Joost: On the 1st floor|1
13-09-17 09:34 - Hannes: We are sitting in the back, when you arrive from the main entrance|1
13-09-17 11:44 - Hannes: we were thinking about solutions and practical ways to make the drones work. but it had a lot of negative traits. We than looked at zeppelin based transport but we concluded that you need almost 900 liters per kg construction to keep it mid-air and that it would cost a lot. We were convinced that transportation by ground-vehical would be the most practical, easiest and safest.|1
13-09-17 11:44 - Hannes: i will send the document of zeppelin based transport and joost will send it about drones|1
13-09-17 11:44 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
13-09-17 11:45 - Hannes: if anyone knows a solution about the problems we saw than it we could make it work|1
13-09-17 11:45 - Hannes: otherwise im strong in favor of making a ground-vehical|1
13-09-17 11:45 - Luke: I strongly believe we can make a drone|1
13-09-17 11:45 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
13-09-17 11:46 - Hannes: please read the word document|1
13-09-17 11:46 - Luke: But I dont know Wich problems you saw offcourse|1
13-09-17 11:46 - Joost: If we can counter all the problems in the PDF file, then we could do it|1
13-09-17 11:47 - Luke: I will look at the file tonight|1
13-09-17 11:47 - Luke: I dont have the time right now|1
13-09-17 11:47 - Hannes: yeah sure|1
13-09-17 11:49 - Luke: But good work looking into it 👍🏼|1
13-09-17 11:50 - Luke: But we should also know the possible implications of building a vhicle that needs to drive on a rough terrein|1
13-09-17 11:51 - Hannes: yes indeed, but if that would be much easier, practical and safer|1
13-09-17 11:51 - Hannes: since we were planning on specialising on the grabbing function|1
13-09-17 12:00 - Natalia: I'm gonna look at the document later as well, cause I'm also in favor of building a drone, and the fact that drones with the same functionality exist clearly prove that it's possible|1
13-09-17 12:03 - Hannes: we dont know if its possible due to the constraints we have|1
13-09-17 12:03 - Hannes: for example the budget|1
13-09-17 12:19 - Natalia: Well there are many examples online of what is possible|1
13-09-17 12:19 - Natalia: http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/arduino-quadcopter-built-using-arduino-yun-development-board-09-06-2015/|1
13-09-17 12:19 - Natalia: https://www.google.nl/amp/www.instructables.com/id/DIY-ARDUINO-FLIGHT-CONTROLLER/%3famp_page=true|1
13-09-17 12:20 - Luke: Everything is possible if you put in enough effort 😏👌🏽|1
13-09-17 12:24 - Hannes: Well i believe it is possible, altough hard and has a lower chance of succes. But i dont see the advantage that the drone has over a ground-vehicle. I think you need to put a lot of efford in the built, calculation and other things in the drone. If you put that time in a ground-vehicle, im sure you can make that vehicle faster and more reliable|1
13-09-17 12:26 - Luke: But not more special|1
13-09-17 12:26 - Luke: And the idea is to learn the most out of it|1
13-09-17 12:27 - Luke: Not to get the simpelst passes|1
13-09-17 12:27 - Natalia: The advantage is that you make something interesting, whereas I'm pretty sure most people will make some sort of a truck :)|1
13-09-17 12:33 - Joost: We need to get four motors with the same power, we need to do the drone almost perfectly symmetrical,we need to pick the casualty symmetrical up, we can't buy a stabilizer, motors cost us already 40 euro's...


I agree that a drone is way cooler and way more interesting but I believe it has a 99% chance of failing|1
13-09-17 12:35 - Luke: We dont need to pick op 4 casualties at ones|1
13-09-17 12:35 - Luke: We can choose to Only pick up one at the time|1
13-09-17 12:35 - Luke: Because I think that is more realistic as Well|1
13-09-17 12:36 - Luke: This means we could also choose for a two propeller drone instead of 4 Which means we Only need two motors|1
13-09-17 12:36 - Joost: Yeah but how are you going to pick a casualty symmetrically up?|1
13-09-17 12:36 - Joost: 2 propeller is even more unstable|1
13-09-17 12:36 - Luke: We should look into that|1
13-09-17 12:37 - Joost: I have, on the internet people state that quad is best for stability and for beginners building it|1
13-09-17 12:37 - Luke: What I mean to say is that offcourse if wont be easy and Maybe we will fail. But the idea is to challange oursels and try to learn as much as possible and the wat you learn the most is to encounter problems not avoiding them by choosing the "easy" way|1
13-09-17 12:38 - Luke: We are not "biginners" we are egineers studying at tue|1
13-09-17 12:39 - Hannes: I think that as original as possible is the preference|1
13-09-17 12:39 - Luke: And I believe a quad is most stable, thats also Why it already has been done a milion times|1
13-09-17 12:39 - Hannes: I think it is more important to have something reliable|1
13-09-17 12:39 - Hannes: And that we specialise in the grabbing motion|1
13-09-17 12:40 - Hannes: Requirements are more important than lookd|1
13-09-17 12:41 - Joost: I think building a ground vehicle is challenging enough|1
13-09-17 12:41 - Hannes: Yes indeed|1
13-09-17 12:41 - Luke: We will discuss this friday|1
13-09-17 12:41 - Hannes: Joost and i had an idea but not enough time to work it out|1
13-09-17 12:42 - Luke: But the argument "it is easier" Does not count for me|1
13-09-17 12:42 - Hannes: We were planning to do that on friday|1
13-09-17 12:44 - Hannes: Well it was not meant that way, but i dont want us to get stuck on a drone that might work might not. If we would have spend that time on a ground-vehical we can have a more specialised rod that would meet the requirements faster and better|1
13-09-17 12:44 - Joost: It is easier is not the argument. The arguments are in the pdf file, moreover the argument it is more difficult does not count for me|1
13-09-17 12:44 - Hannes: What joost sais|0
13-09-17 12:44 - Luke: Hahahaha|0
13-09-17 12:45 - Luke: Why you came to college, to learn right? So finding challanges must be an argument, otherwise you should not be studying|1
13-09-17 12:45 - Hannes: So you find making a ground-vehicle not challenging?|1
13-09-17 12:46 - Luke: Well I am not saying it is "easy" but it sure aint innovative|1
13-09-17 12:47 - Hannes: If you have an innovative grabbing plus storing mechanism it is innovative|1
13-09-17 12:47 - Hannes: Besides the innovative part.is a preference right?|1
13-09-17 12:47 - Hannes: Not really a requirement|1
13-09-17 12:47 - Luke: It is a requirement|1
13-09-17 12:47 - Joost: Sorry Luuk, I have not build anything in my life yet... therefore starting with a drone seems to me impossible and my research confirmed it (however with 400 euro's it is possible).
I have never programmed anything and never build anything, so a ground vehicle seems to me like a very big challenge|1
13-09-17 12:48 - Hannes: Well if you have one part that is inmovative, for example the gravbing motion, it meets the requirement|1
13-09-17 12:48 - Luke: Again we will discuss this friday|1
13-09-17 12:48 - Hannes: Yess|1
13-09-17 12:48 - Hannes: Till friday!|0
13-09-17 12:48 - Luke: We are with five people so we will vote on it|1
13-09-17 12:49 - Hannes: Please read the pdfs so you can see what arguments we had|1
13-09-17 12:49 - Luke: I will|1
13-09-17 12:50 - Luke: If 3 of you want a ground  ROD I will accept that and we go for that|1
13-09-17 12:50 - Luke: I Just prefer drone|1
13-09-17 12:50 - Joost: Our Shitty protypes should be linked to the vehicle. For a ground vehicle there are other options than for drones.


We tried to look up how we were going to make a drone, we failed... so before we are voting for a drone, I would like to know how 😬|1
13-09-17 12:51 - Luke: You are not going to find out making a drone in one afternoon 😂|1
13-09-17 12:52 - Joost: I understand, but knowing if it is possible can be done|1
13-09-17 12:52 - Luke: It has been done so it is possible|1
13-09-17 12:52 - Joost: Within 70 euro's?|1
13-09-17 12:52 - Joost: With grabbing arms?|1
13-09-17 12:53 - Luke: Why grabbing arms|1
13-09-17 12:53 - Joost: Picking up*|1
13-09-17 12:53 - Luke: Thats not a requirement just an idea|1
13-09-17 12:53 - Luke: There are more options|1
13-09-17 12:54 - Hannes: the preliminary design with prototype must be ready within 9 days eh|1
13-09-17 12:54 - Natalia: Uff what a heated discussion and I can't even participate cause I'm having tests in other subjects 😊 I'll get back to reading about this stuff in the evening. For now there's some info on how it's done in the articles that I sent earlier|1
13-09-17 12:54 - Hannes: then we need to presentate that|1
13-09-17 12:55 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
13-09-17 12:55 - Luke: A lot of examples for making drones for less then $100|1
13-09-17 12:56 - Luke: And that is inclusing the parts we already have|1
13-09-17 12:56 - Luke: Meaning that it is possible|1
13-09-17 12:57 - Hannes: well i dont want to follow a tutorial of someone else... if a person that has a lot of experience can make a drone within 99 dollars with parts that are complete (probably). does not mean we can do that/should that|1
13-09-17 12:58 - Natalia: Basically I agree that the flight controller is the hardest part to make and probably too expensive to buy, but if we master making it we're good|1
13-09-17 12:58 - Luke: You are only talking about the face a drone is hard to make, What makes you believe an quad is easier and How are you going to make a quad without looking at any tutorials ?|1
13-09-17 12:58 - Natalia: Quad is 100% the option to go for, will be too unstable otherwise|1
13-09-17 12:59 - Joost: That's what the internet indeed says|1
13-09-17 12:59 - Natalia: And of course we need to look at the tutorials and many many many of them|1
13-09-17 12:59 - Hannes: yeah sorry that is my bad|0
13-09-17 12:59 - Luke: 2000 years ago they also said the world was flat 😂|0
13-09-17 13:00 - Hannes: well we will talk it on friday|0
13-09-17 13:00 - Joost: What are we going to do with the Spa?|1
13-09-17 13:00 - Joost: SPs|1
13-09-17 13:01 - Hannes: sps?|0
13-09-17 13:01 - Luke: Just make something|1
13-09-17 13:01 - Luke: It is Just a first prototype and can always be adjusted to eather drone or quad|1
13-09-17 13:02 - Luke: It is Just to gather ideas|1
13-09-17 13:02 - Joost: Okay thanks|0
13-09-17 16:02 - Natalia: https://youtu.be/4gJVcfd98bg|1
13-09-17 16:03 - Natalia: Something to consider maybe. Doesn't even need extra power|1
13-09-17 17:49 - Roos: I do not really understand what we have to make for tomorrow, something from that list with picking up solutions. But how do we know that we are not all making the same thing? 🙈|1
13-09-17 18:02 - Natalia: Yeah you need to make a prototype of a picking up solution, whichever you like best :) for example, I found this solution with a claw that I posted earlier so I'll probably try making something like it|1
13-09-17 18:12 - Roos: Okay I will do it tomorrow haha|0
13-09-17 18:28 - Joost: I will use a digging machine like thing|1
13-09-17 18:30 - Roos: Shal I make the net? 🙊|1
13-09-17 18:30 - Joost: Picking up with a net is fone|1
13-09-17 18:36 - Roos: Is it already done?|1
13-09-17 18:36 - Joost: No, but transporting with a net is not a way of picking up,sorry I was not clear|1
13-09-17 18:37 - Roos: Ahhh okay|0
13-09-17 18:39 - Luke: You can pick up with a net|1
13-09-17 18:48 - Roos: That is what I meant|0
13-09-17 19:57 - Natalia: Luke, can you please upload that arduino book you were talking about? 😊|1
13-09-17 20:28 - Luke: I will look for it|1
13-09-17 20:28 - Luke: I really think I have I Good idea about grabbing someone en at the same time store them|1
13-09-17 20:29 - Luke: Will explain it friday|1
13-09-17 20:30 - Natalia: Nice. Will you make a prototype of it?|1
13-09-17 20:31 - Luke: Yes I will try|1
13-09-17 20:31 - Luke: Just not sure if it is a perfect idea so i am curious to your feedback on it|1
13-09-17 20:32 - Natalia: Let's see on Friday :)|0
13-09-17 20:39 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
13-09-17 20:39 - Luke: I putted it on drive|1

13-09-17 20:40 - Natalia: Awesome, thank you!!|0
13-09-17 20:44 - Luke: Np|0
13-09-17 20:48 - Hannes: I have an idea aswell for grabbig an storing in one motion|1
13-09-17 21:08 - Natalia: 👍🏻👍🏻|0
14-09-17 08:35 - Joost: Ive updated the planning 📆. Could you all have a look at it and give feedaback?|1
14-09-17 10:13 - Joost: Can someone have a look at my HWA 3 and maybe give some feedback? 😀|1
14-09-17 10:42 - Hannes: Im going to make my prototype first, if i have enough time i will look at yours|1
14-09-17 12:21 - Hannes: your ssa looks great joost|0
14-09-17 12:21 - Hannes: sorry hwa|0
14-09-17 12:23 - Joost: 🙂|0
14-09-17 17:13 - Joost: @31650972942 Maybe should add a part where you say what external people said about your design. Or bullshit about it 😉|1
14-09-17 17:42 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
14-09-17 17:42 - Luke: My prototype 😂👍🏼|1
14-09-17 17:47 - Luke: Hahahaha hannes you prototype really looks like a lot of fun|0
14-09-17 17:47 - Luke: You sort of fly into the net ?|1
14-09-17 18:04 - Natalia: Really like your prototype Luke 👍🏻 that's exactly what we were talking about last meeting, now made real 😄👍🏻|0
14-09-17 18:07 - Luke: Thanks|0
14-09-17 18:07 - Luke: It needs some explanation Because I thought about some isseus|0

15-09-17 13:02 - Natalia: Unfortunately can't|0
15-09-17 13:14 - Luke: Hannes did you print my hwa and the agenda ?|1
15-09-17 13:33 - Hannes: Not yet|1
15-09-17 13:33 - Hannes: Im not yet at the tue|0
15-09-17 14:33 - Luke: Im already in the paviljoen kantine|1
15-09-17 14:36 - Hannes: Ill be there in 15 minutes prob|1
15-09-17 14:38 - Luke: okay|0
15-09-17 14:38 - Hannes: Im at the printing shop|1
15-09-17 14:38 - Hannes: Do i need to print aomethig?|1
15-09-17 14:38 - Hannes: Something?|1
15-09-17 14:38 - Luke: Yeah if you could|1
15-09-17 14:38 - Luke: My HWA3 and the agenda times 6?|1
15-09-17 14:38 - Hannes: Are the files on drive?|1
15-09-17 14:38 - Hannes: Yeah sure|1
15-09-17 14:38 - Luke: yes|1
15-09-17 14:38 - Luke: My hwa is in the hwa map|1
15-09-17 14:39 - Luke: and the agenda in the minutes/agenda mao|1
15-09-17 15:01 - Joost: Where are you?|1
15-09-17 16:08 - Luke: http://www.droneybee.com/arduino-quadcopter-guide/|1
16-09-17 10:56 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
16-09-17 10:58 - Natalia: Oh my 😃 heaven! 👏🏻|0
16-09-17 10:58 - Luke: Hahahaha Nice one 👌🏽|0
16-09-17 11:06 - Hannes: Haha nice|0
16-09-17 11:52 - Joost: The camera will be underneath the drone, facing downwards?|1
16-09-17 11:52 - Luke: Kind of|1
16-09-17 11:53 - Luke: It doesnt face downwards I think, is faces frontwards and can rotste 360 degrees|1
16-09-17 11:57 - Natalia: The gimbal is mounted facing downwards|1
16-09-17 11:59 - Natalia: <Media weggelaten>|1
16-09-17 11:59 - Natalia: Like that|1
16-09-17 12:34 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
16-09-17 12:35 - Luke: Looks nice and good idea about the colours 👍🏼|0
16-09-17 12:36 - Natalia: I really like it too, good job so far 👏🏻|0
16-09-17 12:36 - Joost: And I will build it in away that you could easily remove the arduino part, and the camera part and the Mantis Claw|1
16-09-17 12:40 - Hannes: nice one!|0
16-09-17 13:32 - Natalia: I have a suggestion. Maybe it would be better if I focus on the necessary parts for the drone cause I'm now kind of doing it anyway (need to know which work better with which for programming). And someone else focuses on the silicon padding for the claw? Hannes? :)|1
16-09-17 13:38 - Luke: Id hannes want to do the claw Im fine with it, But i would like to coleberate with the one making the drone/programming Because I also have expirience in prototyping with arduino, so that would mean I collaborate with you natalia if hannes aggrees|1
16-09-17 13:39 - Hannes: I dont mind, i will work on it sunday and monday if necessary|1
16-09-17 13:40 - Luke: I also will be working on it this sunday|1
16-09-17 13:40 - Luke: So you two may decide who joins me with the prototype?|1
16-09-17 13:41 - Natalia: Ok thanks Hannes, I really think I'm more useful at electrical/programming part than 3D :)|0
16-09-17 13:41 - Natalia: So Luke we do this together then|1
16-09-17 13:41 - Luke: Okeay for me|0
16-09-17 13:42 - Natalia: I think I'm gonna start a document on in our drive a bit later today about what I found so far|1
16-09-17 13:42 - Luke: Sounds Good|0
16-09-17 13:43 - Luke: I dont have time today But I will look at it tomorrow|1
16-09-17 13:43 - Natalia: Okay|0
16-09-17 13:53 - Roos: Wow nice prototype Joost!!|0
16-09-17 14:11 - Joost: I think I do not have the right equipment to build the Mantis Claw. However I could build two claws (out of 6). I could also build a combination between Luuks idea and the Mantis Claw|1
16-09-17 14:11 - Luke: Yeah you could make that|0
16-09-17 14:12 - Joost: I do not know how beautiful it will be 🤔|0
16-09-17 14:12 - Luke: If someone can make a visualisation of the claw in CAD? Than we can put it on the poster en explain the idea even if the prototype doenst look exact the same ?|1
16-09-17 14:14 - Natalia: That would be great, yes (the visualization)|0
16-09-17 14:14 - Luke: But can someone make that, I dont know How CAD works, you @31650972942 ?|1
16-09-17 14:23 - Hannes: Yess|1
16-09-17 14:23 - Hannes: I will do that tomorrow|1
16-09-17 14:28 - Luke: Nice|0
16-09-17 14:32 - Joost: Uhm the Mantis Claw is very hard to make... can we use the shitty prototype?|1
16-09-17 14:32 - Natalia: Sure, but like.. it's really shitty 🙈|1
16-09-17 14:50 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
16-09-17 14:50 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
16-09-17 14:50 - Joost: Anyone more ideas?|1
16-09-17 14:51 - Luke: Looks Nice|0
16-09-17 14:51 - Natalia: Looks great 👍🏻|0
16-09-17 14:52 - Natalia: For the claw, I don't know, maybe you have some better hinges than the ones I used in the prototype and could remake it with the same principle, but better?|1
16-09-17 14:53 - Luke: Maybe use aluminium folie like I did|1
16-09-17 14:53 - Luke: And Just rope|1
16-09-17 14:55 - Natalia: Also|0
16-09-17 14:55 - Natalia: Maybe we should add the legs?|1
16-09-17 14:56 - Natalia: For landing|1
16-09-17 14:57 - Natalia: <Media weggelaten>|1
16-09-17 14:57 - Joost: Are we going to use legs?|1
16-09-17 14:57 - Natalia: Well landing on a camera would not be the best idea|1
16-09-17 16:36 - Joost: Fair point 😂|0
17-09-17 11:06 - Roos: <Media weggelaten>|1
17-09-17 11:28 - Joost: The 5 design concepts don't have to be on the poster. The prototypes will be shown on a table.|1
17-09-17 11:29 - Joost: By the way I can't make the Mantis Claw with Lego so we are going to use natalia's prototype?|1
17-09-17 11:31 - Joost: And I would like to start with making ideas and calculations with the landing system|1
17-09-17 11:52 - Roos: <Media weggelaten>|1
17-09-17 11:54 - Luke: Wooow which program are you using roos ?|1
17-09-17 11:54 - Luke: Looks really Good 👌🏽👍🏼|0
17-09-17 11:55 - Roos: Indesign 😊|1
17-09-17 11:56 - Luke: First time you use it ?|1
17-09-17 12:00 - Roos: Yes, but with some help of youtube|1
17-09-17 12:00 - Luke: I think it looks really Good, especially for a first time User 👍🏼👍🏼|0
17-09-17 12:01 - Joost: It looks indeed really nice|0
17-09-17 12:10 - Natalia: Looks great, Roos! 👍🏻👍🏻|0
17-09-17 12:11 - Natalia: Though I think the 5 concepts should be on the poster too|1
17-09-17 12:11 - Natalia: Just briefly|1
17-09-17 12:13 - Natalia: As for my prototype, like I said yesterday, maybe someone could remake it and make it look more elegant, I don't know? Like if someone has hinges like I used but thinner. Any volunteers? 😄|1
17-09-17 12:18 - Roos: My prototype also does not look really nice, so maybe it is not a good idea that I try to remake yours 🙈|1
17-09-17 12:22 - Natalia: Haha okay 😅 someone else maybe?|1
17-09-17 12:53 - Joost: I do not have any experience with building prototypes and I think also not the right materials for it 😬|1
17-09-17 13:10 - Hannes: hi i have a problem with editing the mantis claw. i can import the stl-files from the site but those files i cant edit|1
17-09-17 13:10 - Hannes: so should i start a mantis-claw on my own|1
17-09-17 13:10 - Hannes: or should we adjust the claw after the printing?|1
17-09-17 13:11 - Hannes: i think the best solution would be to e-mail the professor whether or not this is allowed since we are printing a whole object|1
17-09-17 13:12 - Hannes: this was also already said in the meeting but did anyone e-mail to it a professor?|1
17-09-17 13:12 - Hannes: i'll start with the frame|1
17-09-17 13:15 - Natalia: Yeah I'm planning to email them today but I think we agreed on modifying the mantis claw with padding (silicon etc). So I was gonna ask if we can combine several found technologies like that. Cause I'm pretty sure if I just ask "can we use an existing design" the answer will be no|1
17-09-17 13:15 - Hannes: yes but if the answer is no even if we modify the claw than we need to make it our own right?|1
17-09-17 13:16 - Hannes: it can be done though|1
17-09-17 13:16 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
17-09-17 13:16 - Hannes: also are the measurements known for the arduino kit?|1
17-09-17 13:17 - Natalia: Well my idea is to ask a question that way so that the answer is yes 😬|1
17-09-17 13:17 - Hannes: haha nice|0
17-09-17 13:18 - Natalia: I'll be doing the work on the parts later today :) got myself a scale so all good 😬|1
17-09-17 13:18 - Hannes: ah oke|0
17-09-17 13:26 - Natalia: Also bought some books on drone building, you guys might find them useful too, I've uploaded them to the drive|1
17-09-17 13:28 - Hannes: ill look at it|0
17-09-17 13:42 - Hannes: did anyone already had a link for the propellers?|1
17-09-17 13:44 - Natalia: not entirely sure about them yet, but something like that|1
17-09-17 13:44 - Natalia: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-propeller-with-dji-fitting-10x4-5-black-ccw-2pcs.html?___store=en_us|1
17-09-17 13:48 - Hannes: thx!|0
17-09-17 13:58 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
17-09-17 13:59 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
17-09-17 14:00 - Luke: Most tutorials I saw they were rectangular|1
17-09-17 14:00 - Hannes: ah than ill make it rectangular|1
17-09-17 14:00 - Luke: Because arduino ect are rectangular|1
17-09-17 14:00 - Joost: The arduino is rectangular, hopefully that is going to be the maximum width and length we need it to make|1
17-09-17 14:01 - Luke: Yeah|0
17-09-17 14:02 - Natalia: No arduino is not the maximum width and length, there should be a board with accelerometer etc next to it|1
17-09-17 14:02 - Hannes: can you please give those maximum width and lengths|1
17-09-17 14:02 - Hannes: need those for the frame|1
17-09-17 14:04 - Joost: I will start working on different landing systems, is that okay? I'm asking because it was not one of my HWA.|1
17-09-17 14:05 - Natalia: Arduino is 6 x 7.3 cm, I'd say double the the width and maybe +30% on the length|1
17-09-17 14:05 - Natalia: So about 10x12 cm|1
17-09-17 14:06 - Hannes: i will make it symetrical|1
17-09-17 14:06 - Natalia: But that's approximately|1
17-09-17 14:06 - Hannes: so 12 x 12|1
17-09-17 14:07 - Natalia: Cause I can't tell for sure how all the board stacking will work out, but I hope it will be enough|1
17-09-17 14:07 - Natalia: Ok|0
17-09-17 14:07 - Natalia: Joost, landing systems design would be great 👍🏻|0
17-09-17 14:14 - Hannes: i dont think i can design the frame on my own, i cant really say how long everything needs to be and how it should fit. I will look for every part with specifications and i will work tomorrow on the cad-model in metaforum. If anyone can join me with solutions and for where every part should be, that would be great|1
17-09-17 14:16 - Natalia: What time do you plan to be in meta tomorrow?|1
17-09-17 14:16 - Hannes: i can be there after the break|1
17-09-17 14:17 - Hannes: so 13:45|1
17-09-17 14:21 - Natalia: I have a class then :( But tonight I'll try to find as much info as possible for you to work with|1
17-09-17 14:21 - Hannes: ah no problem|0
17-09-17 15:11 - Hannes: there is a problem|1
17-09-17 15:11 - Hannes: we thought that the mantis-claw could be printed at the tueshop or something at vertigo|1
17-09-17 15:11 - Hannes: but that is not the case|1
17-09-17 15:11 - Hannes: we have a certain amount of material for lasercutting|1
17-09-17 15:11 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
17-09-17 15:12 - Hannes: we can use a 3d-printer at shapeways|1
17-09-17 15:12 - Hannes: but in my experience those are expensive af|1
17-09-17 15:17 - Hannes: we can make the frame with the aluminum u-profiles and the plywood|1
17-09-17 15:20 - Natalia: Hm damn that workshop has some really limited options.. maybe we should still try and request a price from shapeways?|1
17-09-17 15:21 - Hannes: yess but then a problem is that i couldnt saw the mantis-claw inside the shop of shapeways, i think the person who own the intelectual property rights is the only one who can add that to the shop of shapeways|1
17-09-17 15:22 - Hannes: since im not sure if you can just upload their work|1
17-09-17 15:24 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
17-09-17 15:24 - Hannes: and expensive af|1
17-09-17 15:24 - Hannes: this is only one part out of five|1
17-09-17 15:24 - Hannes: and the smallest|1
17-09-17 15:24 - Hannes: the whole construction of the mantis claw would be very expensive|1
17-09-17 15:24 - Hannes: so i dont think 3d printing is an option|1
17-09-17 15:26 - Natalia: Hm yeah.. maybe we could order laser cutting somewhere outside the tue? And that would be cheaper than 3D and possibly inside our budget?|1
17-09-17 15:27 - Hannes: yeah could be|1
17-09-17 15:27 - Hannes: i'll try to find something|1
17-09-17 15:29 - Hannes: also i tried to calculate the amount of thrust the propellers could generate, but those formulas are very vague. Maybe joost can help me with that this week?|1
17-09-17 15:29 - Natalia: Okay thanks 👍🏻|0
17-09-17 15:32 - Hannes: we could however, make it out of plywood|1
17-09-17 16:30 - Natalia: You think it will work?|1
17-09-17 16:33 - Hannes: im not sure 4 mm is not really thick|1
17-09-17 16:33 - Hannes: but we can try|1
17-09-17 16:33 - Hannes: since we have a lot of plywood available|1
17-09-17 16:34 - Hannes: if it doesnt work we can glue two of those together perhaps|1
17-09-17 16:42 - Natalia: Okay yes sounds good! But I guess we should still look for a backup laser cutting place|1
17-09-17 16:54 - Luke: You can glue them together|1
17-09-17 16:55 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
17-09-17 16:55 - Luke: This is a machine I made with plywood from vertigo|1
17-09-17 16:55 - Hannes: Ah nice!|0
17-09-17 16:55 - Luke: And glued all together|1
17-09-17 16:56 - Luke: And i painted it with woodpaint which made it look Nice|1
17-09-17 17:19 - Joost: I calculated the weight of our landing mechanism if we did it with wood (700kg/m3). It depends on the length but It will probably be like 0.200 kilograms|1
17-09-17 17:20 - Joost: To be sure between 0.200 and 0.300
You can read it in my hwa 4 or the document landing mechanism on drive|1
17-09-17 17:20 - Hannes: i didnt find a clear solution how to calculate the amount of thrust, can you help me on monday?|1
17-09-17 17:20 - Joost: Monday morning or afternoon?|1
17-09-17 17:20 - Hannes: afternoon|1
17-09-17 17:21 - Joost: I have a lecture in the afternoon till half past 5|1
17-09-17 17:21 - Hannes: ah too bad|0
17-09-17 17:22 - Joost: I will look some things up tomorrow and try to help, otherwise we'll proceed the thrust for the next hwa|1
17-09-17 17:22 - Hannes: yess|0
17-09-17 19:05 - Joost: I did some research for how you can calculate the thrust. However I think its more complicated then just a force reaction|1
17-09-17 19:06 - Hannes: it is|1
17-09-17 19:06 - Hannes: and i saw some experimental data with the same propeller|1
17-09-17 19:07 - Hannes: but im not sure if we can assume those as correct|1
17-09-17 19:07 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
17-09-17 19:07 - Joost: This could be helpful|1
17-09-17 19:08 - Hannes: it could be helpfull but im not sure if we have all of the experimental determined coefficient|1
17-09-17 19:08 - Hannes: and it is not smart to just buy a certain propeller and experiment to find out we dont have the correct one|1
17-09-17 19:11 - Joost: I assume that thrust works just like a reaction force but the velocity of the air and area will differ much. Moreover aerodynamica will make understanding flying even more difficult|1
17-09-17 19:12 - Hannes: im not sure if we can calculate it|1
17-09-17 19:13 - Hannes: i think we need an arduino setting to channel how much watt the motors give|1
17-09-17 19:13 - Hannes: and by trial and error see how much W will generate enough lifting force|1
17-09-17 19:18 - Joost: We should calculate with assumptions to know what kind of propellors and motors we need, I think|1
17-09-17 19:19 - Hannes: yes we can make rough estimates but still i think we also need to make a setting to channel the amount of power the motors are running|1
17-09-17 19:19 - Hannes: and not just an on and off switch|1
17-09-17 19:20 - Joost: You mean like we need to be able to adjust the power to the motors?|1
17-09-17 19:20 - Hannes: yes|1
17-09-17 19:21 - Joost: Yeah I agree. We probably need to do lots of testing with the motors 😉.|1
17-09-17 19:21 - Hannes: also because the theoretical amount of lifting force might differ to the practical force|1
18-09-17 10:46 - Hannes: Do we have a certain requirement that the drone needs to be x amount of minutes airborn?|1
18-09-17 10:47 - Hannes: since the motors we chose have a maximum power output of 200 W each|1
18-09-17 10:47 - Luke: I think 45min|1
18-09-17 10:47 - Hannes: ah oke|0
18-09-17 10:47 - Luke: Because that is How long the run takes|1
18-09-17 10:47 - Luke: So at least 45min, I would aim for 60min to be sure|1
18-09-17 10:48 - Hannes: ah oke i will see how much capacity the poweroutput needs to have|1
18-09-17 10:48 - Luke: Okido|0
18-09-17 11:04 - Hannes: uhm we might have a problem, i assumed for the worst so i assumed all motors uses the maximum amount of W that is 200 . Then i looked at batteries that have an acceptable pricerange (10 euros) and we have 0,5 % of battery capacity available if we used the maximum settings|1
18-09-17 11:04 - Hannes: i think i calculated it right|1
18-09-17 11:06 - Hannes: im not sure that the motor uses 200 W since that is really a large number|1
18-09-17 11:06 - Hannes: but it is stated in the describtion so im a bit confused|1
18-09-17 11:07 - Joost: Uhm I have an example of a motor which needs 11.1V and 10.6A at his maximum|1
18-09-17 11:08 - Joost: This motor provides 410 thrust|1
18-09-17 11:08 - Hannes: well p=u*i so that is not really that much power|1
18-09-17 11:08 - Joost: 410 gram|1
18-09-17 11:08 - Hannes: that is way more likely|0
18-09-17 11:08 - Hannes: 410 N???|0
18-09-17 11:08 - Hannes: oh 410 g|0
18-09-17 11:08 - Joost: No 410 gram,I read it wrong|0
18-09-17 11:09 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
18-09-17 11:09 - Luke: Guys I think I have a problem..|1
18-09-17 11:10 - Joost: Oh no|0
18-09-17 11:11 - Luke: I am really not feeling well scince yesterday and hoped it would be better today so that I could work on my hwa. I was trying to work on it right now but I really cant focus because off a headache and dizziness..|1
18-09-17 11:12 - Joost: It is not a problem. Try to get better first 👍🏼! Will you be there on Tuesday?|1
18-09-17 11:13 - Luke: I know it comes at a shitty time and I hope I will soon get better so that I can help on everything before friday|1
18-09-17 11:13 - Luke: No sure if I will be there tomorrow, depends on how I feel.|1
18-09-17 11:15 - Luke: But @31623773620  did you already make a start with our part of the hwa? I dont think I can add a lot today But Maybe I can have a look at it and add something later on today or tonorrow if I feel better?|1
18-09-17 11:15 - Hannes: beterschap!|0
18-09-17 11:16 - Hannes: maybe a bit late|1
18-09-17 11:16 - Hannes: but look what i found|1
18-09-17 11:16 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
18-09-17 11:16 - Hannes: how cool is this|0
18-09-17 11:16 - Luke: Hu What is that ?|1
18-09-17 11:16 - Luke: What are those round things ?|1
18-09-17 11:17 - Hannes: weels|1
18-09-17 11:17 - Luke: Hahaha sick|0
18-09-17 11:17 - Hannes: so it is way more efficient|1
18-09-17 11:17 - Hannes: doesnt have to overcome the gravitational force|1
18-09-17 11:18 - Hannes: but the idea of a drone is a bit lost haha|1
18-09-17 11:18 - Hannes: maybe we can have that as a backup-plan|1
18-09-17 11:18 - Hannes: if we dont succeed in making a drone|1
18-09-17 11:19 - Luke: Good idea to keep it in mind|0
18-09-17 11:19 - Natalia: Get better, Luke! Like I told you yesterday, I've also been ill all weekend, but I'm working now, so I'll have something by the evening 👍🏻|1
18-09-17 11:20 - Luke: Oow yeah you were feeling ill to? Are you feeling better right now ?|1
18-09-17 11:22 - Natalia: Yes, I think I texted you that yesterday. Not very well right now, but gotta work :)|1
18-09-17 11:24 - Joost: Восстановление|0
18-09-17 11:26 - Natalia: Hahaha Joost thanks! 😄 you've kinda just told me to repair myself but it's subject appropriate so I'll take that 😄|0
18-09-17 11:28 - Luke: Hahahaha|0
18-09-17 11:54 - Joost: Google translate sucks|0
18-09-17 12:18 - Roos: Get well soon Luke and Natalia!!|0
18-09-17 12:25 - Luke: Thanks roos|0
18-09-17 12:28 - Hannes: natalia do you already have the measurements for the parts you have?|1
18-09-17 12:48 - Natalia: Thanks Roos!|0
18-09-17 12:49 - Natalia: Hannes, for the parts that I have yes|1
18-09-17 12:49 - Natalia: Uploaded that to the drive|1
18-09-17 12:49 - Hannes: ah thank you!|0
18-09-17 12:49 - Hannes: the parts you had were the biggest right?|1
18-09-17 12:50 - Natalia: But I'm still reading on the best configuration, for example turns out the motor shield will be useless|1
18-09-17 12:50 - Natalia: In size or in weight?|1
18-09-17 12:50 - Hannes: size|1
18-09-17 12:50 - Hannes: lenght and width|1
18-09-17 12:51 - Natalia: Yes, except maybe the battery|1
18-09-17 12:52 - Hannes: ah oke thx|0
18-09-17 12:55 - Natalia: I think 12x12 for the central plate should be a fair size|1
18-09-17 12:58 - Hannes: I will design it 12x12|1
18-09-17 12:59 - Hannes: How lomg should the arms be?|1
18-09-17 12:59 - Hannes: A bit longer than the radius of a propeller i think?|1
18-09-17 13:05 - Natalia: <Media weggelaten>|1
18-09-17 13:05 - Natalia: Sort of, or even more or less the same?|1
18-09-17 13:12 - Hannes: Ah thx this helps! I will have an idea and a cad file for the frame today. I wont be able to have an estimate of the budget since i am not able to determine the type of engine, propeller and battery in one hwa|1
18-09-17 13:13 - Natalia: Well that's what I'm working on :)|1
18-09-17 13:14 - Hannes: Ah great it was not really clear|0
18-09-17 13:14 - Luke: Really sorry that am I not much of a help today|0
18-09-17 13:14 - Hannes: I was stuck on that|0
18-09-17 13:14 - Hannes: Noo no sorry|0
18-09-17 13:14 - Luke: For next hwa I will do more|0
18-09-17 13:14 - Luke: And you guys can have a break ✌🏼|0
18-09-17 13:15 - Hannes: Haha no need for that just focus on getting rest|0
18-09-17 13:15 - Luke: Do you guys think it will be a big problem for my grade if I dont have a hwa4 ?|1
18-09-17 13:15 - Luke: And should I mail someone about that ?|1
18-09-17 13:15 - Natalia: Hey remember I asked you that we exchange tasks? Like I do the parts, budget etc with Luke, and you do the frame and think how to pad the mantis claw for safety? So I'm doing as agreed :)|1
18-09-17 13:16 - Natalia: @Hannes|1
18-09-17 13:16 - Natalia: Will you do something about the mantis claw by tomorrow?|1
18-09-17 13:16 - Natalia: Luke, maybe mail Nienke?|1
18-09-17 13:17 - Hannes: Luke you should submit a pdf file that states that you are ill|1
18-09-17 13:18 - Hannes: That is what tutors said at previous dbls|1
18-09-17 13:18 - Hannes: I already did somethig with the mantis claw :)|1
18-09-17 13:20 - Natalia: Oh nice! Like with adding soft parts etc?|1
18-09-17 13:23 - Hannes: Well more an idea like adding a platform of plywood and after assembling just add some soft parts to the platform|1
18-09-17 14:30 - Natalia: Ok :) can you estimate approximately how much the frame and the claw would weigh?|1
18-09-17 14:32 - Hannes: The frame i can calculate exact the claw im.not sure|1
18-09-17 14:32 - Hannes: But the claw will be made out of plywood|1
18-09-17 14:33 - Hannes: So that wont be that heavy righy?|1
18-09-17 14:49 - Natalia: So like 100g or something? :)|1
18-09-17 14:49 - Hannes: if we use all aluminum (which is not the case) than we have 196,83 g|1
18-09-17 14:50 - Hannes: but that wont be the case, Im still working on the frame so i will give the exact number if i have them|1
18-09-17 14:51 - Luke: But we still have te make a new verdien of the claw right? Because the basic one is not human ?|1
18-09-17 14:52 - Hannes: the solution about the humane part was that we just glue a wooden platform at the end of the arms i thought|1
18-09-17 14:52 - Hannes: and on that platform softening|1
18-09-17 14:52 - Luke: Yeah but will that work? Think we have to look in to that right ?|1
18-09-17 14:52 - Luke: Maybe something for a new hwa|1
18-09-17 14:53 - Hannes: yeah maybe i think it will work|1
18-09-17 14:53 - Luke: 👌🏽|0
18-09-17 14:53 - Natalia: Ok then I'll assume 200g for the claw for now and you let know about the frame later|1
18-09-17 14:55 - Hannes: the claw will be lighter than that i think since it is from plywood and not aluminum|1
18-09-17 14:56 - Natalia: Yes but maybe we could still think about making it from aluminum like from a 3rd party laser cutting|1
18-09-17 15:05 - Hannes: we could, we could also try the plywood version and if that does not hold we can cut it from aluminum from 3rd party. since it will probably require the same format|1
18-09-17 15:05 - Hannes: so no double work or anything and it might be a large reduction in cost|1
18-09-17 15:05 - Luke: I Agree with that|0
18-09-17 15:06 - Natalia: Yes sounds good|0
18-09-17 15:30 - Hannes: what do you think about a frame like this|1
18-09-17 15:30 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
18-09-17 15:31 - Hannes: it is not finished yet since the arms can move a bit too much due to only one hole|1
18-09-17 15:31 - Hannes: but there can be easily a plywood platform on this|1
18-09-17 15:34 - Luke: Isnt the platform a bit big compared to the arms?|1
18-09-17 15:35 - Hannes: well i have a platform of 12,1*12,1 cm|1
18-09-17 15:35 - Hannes: and the arms are 10 cm|1
18-09-17 15:35 - Hannes: the arms only needs to be as long as the radius of the propellers right?|1
18-09-17 15:36 - Luke: Not sure|1
18-09-17 15:36 - Hannes: the mass of this aluminum construction is 119,5 g|1
18-09-17 15:36 - Luke: I didnt look in to it|1
18-09-17 15:37 - Hannes: well if the only thing that is needed for the arms is enough length in order to seperate the propeller from its base so that it can move as much air as possible then i dont think it needs to be any larger|1
18-09-17 15:39 - Luke: Agree|0
18-09-17 15:40 - Luke: Only one thing, shouldnt the middle part be more closed?|1
18-09-17 15:40 - Hannes: it will be closed of with plywood|1
18-09-17 15:40 - Hannes: since we have enough of that|1
18-09-17 15:40 - Luke: Oké Sounds Good|0
18-09-17 15:40 - Hannes: thx!|0
18-09-17 15:41 - Joost: It probably doesn't need any more length|1
18-09-17 15:52 - Natalia: If the arms are attached only at the corners like that wouldn't that be a bit unstable?|1
18-09-17 15:53 - Hannes: yes and im working on a solution|1
18-09-17 15:54 - Hannes: but the holes needs to be 10 mm apart from eachother and can only have a 42 mm diameter|1
18-09-17 15:54 - Hannes: so we cant put two after eachother on the same frame|1
18-09-17 15:56 - Natalia: Maybe consider an H frame?|1
18-09-17 15:57 - Hannes: that is possible but doesnt help with the problem|1
18-09-17 15:58 - Hannes: i will calculate how much length of aluminum we can use with the current frame first|1
18-09-17 16:25 - Hannes: ahh i had something i just have a few mm too little|1
18-09-17 16:25 - Hannes: i was making a double frame like this|1
18-09-17 16:25 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
18-09-17 16:27 - Hannes: we could make an outer frame just for stabilizing the arms out of plywood?|1
18-09-17 16:32 - Hannes: i have an idea but im not sure if im going to have it before 6 but it will be before the meeting|1
18-09-17 16:49 - Natalia: Hm I guess we better discuss it during the meeting, looks a bit too complicated to me right now 🤔 but I don't know really|1
18-09-17 16:50 - Natalia: Are you taking into account that we'll have a landing system with this frame now?|1
18-09-17 16:51 - Hannes: i havent thought about the landing system yet but i think we can manage with that|1
18-09-17 16:53 - Natalia: Ok :)|0
18-09-17 17:08 - Hannes: yess i managed to do it|1
18-09-17 17:08 - Hannes: the holes are alligned|1
18-09-17 17:08 - Hannes: and we can cut it from the six parts|1
18-09-17 20:34 - Luke: Guys I doubt that I will be at the meeting tomorrow. At the moment I dont feel good at all 😪|1
18-09-17 20:34 - Luke: This afternoon I thought it was going better but right now I feel even badder then this Morning|1
18-09-17 21:14 - Hannes: Ah hope you get better soon|0
19-09-17 08:29 - Natalia: Guys, I'm really sorry but I think I won't be able to come either, not feeling well at all 🙁 I'm gonna email Nienke|1
19-09-17 09:32 - Jodi Grooteman: I have had an accident but i'm feeling a lot better now. So I just had a meeting with a engineering design team person and he told me that i could work  in this group from now on. So I will be at the meeting to help with the robot|1
19-09-17 08:31 - Natalia: I should have been the chair woman, and Roos the secretary I believe, I suggest we swap the order, first you'll be the chairwoman Roos and afterwards me. Ok?|1
19-09-17 08:31 - Luke: Same problem for me 😢 But that really sucks for you guys Hannes, Joost and Roos. Can you manage without us?|1
19-09-17 08:33 - Natalia: Yes it really sucks we got ill at the same time|0
19-09-17 08:35 - Luke: Yeah I hear that it is a small epedemic|0
19-09-17 08:38 - Natalia: Damn :(|0
19-09-17 08:50 - Joost: Take your rest!|0
19-09-17 08:59 - Natalia: Thank you Joost!|0
19-09-17 09:16 - Roos: That is fine Natalia! Make sure you get well first, that is most important at the moment ☺|1
19-09-17 09:17 - Roos: Did you already had any time to make the agenda?|1
19-09-17 09:30 - Natalia: Thank you Roos 🙏🏻 yes, I've uploaded it to the drive 😊|1
19-09-17 09:33 - Jodi Grooteman: I have had an accident but i'm feeling a lot better now. So I just had a meeting with a engineering design team person and he told me that i could work  in this group from now on. So I will be at the meeting to help with the robot|1
19-09-17 09:34 - Joost: Im very happy that you can join again. We are meeting today at 11.45 in vertigo 9.08A|1
19-09-17 09:35 - Natalia: That's great to hear Jodi! 😊 which major are you btw?|1
19-09-17 09:36 - Jodi Grooteman: Oke, thanks. I will be there 😊|1
19-09-17 09:36 - Jodi Grooteman: I'm from psychology and technology|1
19-09-17 09:36 - Jodi Grooteman: You?|1
19-09-17 09:37 - Joost: Natalia is from Software Science, Luuk is from Industrial Design, Hannes is from Mechanical Engineering, Roos is from (Technische bedrijfskunde) and Im from Applied Physics|1
19-09-17 09:39 - Joost: Roos is from industrial engineering (i think that is the English version 😉 )|1
19-09-17 09:40 - Hannes: A great to have you jodi|0
19-09-17 09:40 - Hannes: Natalia and luke take your rest|0
19-09-17 09:41 - Jodi Grooteman: Oeh nice. All different studies|0
19-09-17 09:42 - Natalia: Yes! Do you have any programming experience? :)|1
19-09-17 09:42 - Natalia: Thank you Hannes!|0
19-09-17 09:44 - Jodi Grooteman: I have had an programming course|1
19-09-17 09:44 - Jodi Grooteman: So a little bit I think haha|1
19-09-17 09:48 - Natalia: Haha okay 👌🏻 Maybe we can use that 😊|0
19-09-17 09:59 - Roos: Great Jodi!|0
19-09-17 10:00 - Roos: Joost, we switched chairman/secretary with next meeting, that souls mean that you are the secretary today. Are you okay with that?|1
19-09-17 10:24 - Joost: Yeah I'm fine with that|1
19-09-17 10:41 - Natalia: Hannes, I have an update for the frame. We need to be using props that are 10 inches in diameter, so that's something to take into account for the size|1
19-09-17 10:54 - Hannes: 10 inches diameter?|0
19-09-17 10:54 - Hannes: Damn that is big|1
19-09-17 10:55 - Hannes: One inch is 2,54 cm right?|1
19-09-17 10:55 - Hannes: Are you sure? 25,4 cm is not small|1
19-09-17 11:24 - Natalia: Yes, that's an optimal one for the kind of motors I'm looking at which in turn we need for the kind of weight we'll be carrying. The whole thing is coming together at about 1 kg + mantis claw, + casualty makes it let's say 1.3 - 1.4, so we need a big and stable quad for that|1
19-09-17 11:38 - Joost: The big question is how much our motors + propllere can produce on thrust|1
19-09-17 12:04 - Natalia: Well they say a good thrust weight ratio for our purposes (slow flight, lots of hovering) is 2:1, 3:1. So let's say 3-4.5 kg thrust. So 1.125 thrust per motor. Get a motor that produces max 1.2kg thrust, is most efficient with the 10inch prop and that's approximately the combo|1
19-09-17 12:24 - Joost: Okay thanks|0
19-09-17 12:58 - Joost: Which motor were you looking at?|1
19-09-17 12:59 - Natalia: 2212 920kv|1
19-09-17 12:59 - Natalia: What's the plan for Friday? :)|1
19-09-17 13:22 - Hannes: the plan for friday will be in the minutes|1
19-09-17 13:22 - Hannes: i think the best solution is to ask in a droneshop what for propellers plus motors plus battery cappacity we need|1
19-09-17 13:22 - Hannes: since the motor you send had a very high power output|1
19-09-17 13:23 - Hannes: and battery cappacity is extremely expensive|1
19-09-17 13:23 - Hannes: in uden and den bosch there is a rc-shop|1
19-09-17 13:25 - Natalia: I've uploaded the full specifications file to the drive|1
19-09-17 13:25 - Natalia: You can find all calculations there|1
19-09-17 13:25 - Hannes: ah great|0
19-09-17 13:32 - Luke: http://www.yankodesign.com/2017/09/19/anti-drowning-drones/|1
19-09-17 13:32 - Luke: Hahaha I just saw this in my fb timeline|1
19-09-17 14:42 - Roos: I just uploaded the poster 😊|1
19-09-17 14:43 - Roos: Did I miss a lot after the regular meeting?|1
19-09-17 14:43 - Joost: I'm going home and I will upload the minutes in about 45 minutes|1
19-09-17 14:44 - Joost: A lot of tasks haven't been devided yet|1
19-09-17 14:45 - Joost: Hannes and I are going to a drone shop later this day to ask if they can give us some information or help us 😁|1
19-09-17 14:45 - Hannes: not that much but the main part was that we talked about the amount of power that is going to the motors and how we are going to supply that amount|1
19-09-17 14:45 - Hannes: since 4 motors with 200 W each is really not an option|1
19-09-17 14:46 - Hannes: also i think the requirement of 45 min in air is also really not possible|1
19-09-17 14:46 - Joost: This evening I hopefully be able to talk to a friend who knows a lot about drones. Maybe he can help us out with finding good motors|1
19-09-17 14:46 - Hannes: im glad if we are going to manage 5 min since storing energy is not really simple|1
19-09-17 14:46 - Natalia: Why are 4 motors not an option?|1
19-09-17 14:46 - Hannes: and expensive|1
19-09-17 14:46 - Hannes: 4 motors can be an option|1
19-09-17 14:46 - Hannes: but not that strong|1
19-09-17 14:46 - Hannes: since it requires a lot of power|1
19-09-17 14:46 - Joost: 200 W is too much power|1
19-09-17 14:47 - Natalia: Have you checked what I've uploaded?|1
19-09-17 14:47 - Natalia: It shows exactly how it's possible|1
19-09-17 14:47 - Hannes: well yes but how are you going to have the powersupply?|1
19-09-17 14:47 - Hannes: if we want to be in the air for 45 min|1
19-09-17 14:47 - Hannes: with 800 W|1
19-09-17 14:47 - Hannes: that is 600 Wh|1
19-09-17 14:47 - Natalia: And yes, obviously 45 minutes flight is not an option, that configuration gives 10-15 minutes|1
19-09-17 14:47 - Hannes: still 10 minutes|1
19-09-17 14:48 - Hannes: if you look how much storage that requires|1
19-09-17 14:48 - Natalia: Like we simply can forget about 45 minutes, we won't make a drone like that|1
19-09-17 14:48 - Hannes: and how expensive that is|1
19-09-17 14:48 - Hannes: yes that is not realistic|0
19-09-17 14:48 - Natalia: The expenses are also listed|1
19-09-17 14:48 - Natalia: But we don't need 45 minutes|1
19-09-17 14:48 - Natalia: Why would we keep a drone flying for 45 min?|1
19-09-17 14:49 - Hannes: yeah the details about the parts are nicely listed|1
19-09-17 14:49 - Natalia: All we need is to show that it's able to fly and to pick the casualty|1
19-09-17 14:49 - Hannes: yes indeed|0
19-09-17 14:49 - Hannes: the 45 min was said somewhere|1
19-09-17 14:49 - Natalia: That was the duration of the test|1
19-09-17 14:49 - Hannes: since we needed to have a requirement with a measurable standard|1
19-09-17 14:49 - Hannes: ah oke nvm than|0
19-09-17 14:49 - Natalia: But that's like with all the talking and preparation etc|1
19-09-17 14:50 - Natalia: So I don't think anybody would have anything against a drone flying for 10 minutes, that already would be a nice accomplishment|1
19-09-17 14:50 - Hannes: but still if we are going to have a 10-15 min flight we need more than 100 Wh of storage|1
19-09-17 14:50 - Hannes: with these engines|1
19-09-17 14:50 - Hannes: 100 wh of storage with enough voltage-output for 4 motors of these|1
19-09-17 14:51 - Hannes: i have my doubts|1
19-09-17 14:51 - Hannes: therefore me and joost are going to a radio-control store|1
19-09-17 14:51 - Hannes: and talk with experts on what they recommend|1
19-09-17 14:51 - Joost: And how their drones are able to stay in the air as long as possible|1
19-09-17 14:51 - Hannes: yes indeed|0
19-09-17 14:52 - Natalia: Well I based this on like a ton of tutorials that I've read where people accomplished the goal with a similar or weaker specs|1
19-09-17 14:52 - Natalia: But sure :)|1
19-09-17 14:52 - Hannes: i do believe your specs are right!|1
19-09-17 14:52 - Hannes: but have you looked for the storage aswell?|1
19-09-17 14:53 - Hannes: since one battery with 11.1 voltage and a capacity of 3000 mAh is really small|1
19-09-17 14:56 - Natalia: Well I can't say for sure of course about that battery and its flight time, added that one based on someone's experience using it for I think a 12 minute flight with slightly smaller weight|1
19-09-17 14:56 - Natalia: So yes, I'm not against asking what they'd say about this in a drone shop obviously :)|1
19-09-17 14:57 - Hannes: yeah i will keep the rest up to date|1
19-09-17 14:58 - Natalia: Ok :)|0
19-09-17 15:06 - Hannes: i asked two from electrical engineering and 2 others from mechanical and they all say that the ratio between the power and the capacity is absurd. if we use the formule P=U*I 
for P=189*4
U=11,1 
than I=68 A|1
19-09-17 15:06 - Hannes: a capacity of 3Ah is really really insufice|1
19-09-17 15:07 - Hannes: a required power for a car-engine is 800W|1
19-09-17 15:22 - Joost: Can you check my minutes? By the way do I need to do more with the minutes? Like sending them to Nienke or something?|1
19-09-17 15:22 - Hannes: you need to email them|1
19-09-17 15:23 - Natalia: <Media weggelaten>|1
19-09-17 15:24 - Natalia: This calculator thinks it would hover for 6 minutes with a similar battery (higher cell count)|1
19-09-17 15:25 - Joost: I found a drone motor which is very good, it uses 20W|1
19-09-17 15:25 - Joost: 15W*|1
19-09-17 15:25 - Hannes: oke i think it is best to just ask the person of the rc-shop|1
19-09-17 15:25 - Natalia: But that's with a maximum weight I calculated, maybe I added too much for casualties and claw and frame, cause I don't really know how much they're gonna weigh|1
19-09-17 15:26 - Natalia: But yes asking would be best|1
19-09-17 15:29 - Joost: I think the W in that document is not the right amount 😉|1
19-09-17 15:30 - Natalia: Which document?|1
19-09-17 16:38 - Hannes: well me and joost just came back from the rc and modelshop. we asked to the guy at the counter and he said he didnt have the knowledge to say exactly what kind of engine we needed and etc. He did say that we should probably have around 50 W for each motor. He also said that it is probably the cheapest to buy a whole drone and to dissassemble it for the motors. That way you know for sure if you have the right motors with the right propeller for a certain weight.|1
19-09-17 16:39 - Hannes: i was wrong about the required capacity of the drone, he suggested a 7V 2000mAh battery that would give the drone a 6-10 minute flight|1
19-09-17 16:40 - Natalia: So the guy suggests to buy a drone of this size which would cost like 500 and disassemble it for the motors?|1
19-09-17 16:40 - Hannes: they cost around 70 euro or something|1
19-09-17 16:41 - Hannes: the motors plus propellers plus other components are individual more expensive than whole|1
19-09-17 16:41 - Natalia: Can you give me a link to a drone like that?|1
19-09-17 16:41 - Hannes: and that is retail price|1
19-09-17 16:41 - Hannes: uhm it was in the shop i will look for it|1
19-09-17 16:42 - Natalia: Thank you|0

19-09-17 16:44 - Hannes: if we can buy the first one second-hand somewhere than we are surely oke|1
19-09-17 16:46 - Natalia: Uhm but these are completely different types of drones not meant for carrying any camera or any other weight? How can we possibly compare them?|1
19-09-17 16:49 - Hannes: yes this one is extremely light so that is not a perfectly comparable|1
19-09-17 16:56 - Hannes: i will look if i can find something comparable tomorrow, and maybe send some e-mails to other shops|1
19-09-17 16:56 - Hannes: maybe those can help more|1
19-09-17 17:03 - Natalia: To be honest, I'm a little confused. I've been researching this thing the whole weekend and outlined a decently working configuration that only needs to be tweaked in terms of flight time vs weight. I can send you multiple links where people discuss building a drone exactly like that. So why do we need to look elsewhere, especially at solutions that don't even come close in terms of lifting capacity?|1
19-09-17 17:05 - Luke: Hey guys an girls I am starting to feel a little bit better|1
19-09-17 17:05 - Luke: I have been lying on bed all day 😢|0
19-09-17 17:05 - Luke: What did I miss out and what can I do before friday ?|1
19-09-17 17:36 - Hannes: Im a little confused aswell and i was a bit sceptical. I dont have experience in drones and the amount of power was really high. If you still have the links could you send them?|1

19-09-17 17:51 - Natalia: No problem :)|0
19-09-17 19:19 - Joost: We need a DC motor~information from a masterstudent|1
19-09-17 19:22 - Natalia: They are dc|1
19-09-17 19:23 - Hannes: Is the processor strong enough to have 4 motors at the same time?|1
19-09-17 19:25 - Natalia: Yep|1
19-09-17 19:54 - Hannes: Ah oke nice|0
20-09-17 11:54 - Roos: Just a question for the PDF; who likes to do (part of) the presentation?|1
20-09-17 11:54 - Joost: Only two people at maximum can present|1
20-09-17 12:03 - Luke: I dont mind presenting|1
20-09-17 12:03 - Luke: Im feeling Good today btw 👍🏼|0
20-09-17 12:03 - Luke: Is there a hwa for friday ?|1
20-09-17 12:08 - Joost: No, but we need to prepare for the PD|1
20-09-17 12:13 - Luke: Yeah sorry that I was not able to contribute this week|0
20-09-17 12:13 - Luke: I didnt read everything. Could someone tell me What we have done and What we have to do?|1
20-09-17 12:13 - Luke: And especially What I can do ?|1
20-09-17 12:17 - Natalia: Guys, when do you plan to print the poster? They say the print shop will be too busy on Friday|1
20-09-17 12:17 - Hannes: Tomorrow the poster will be printed|1
20-09-17 12:18 - Natalia: Ok great 👌🏻😊|0
20-09-17 12:19 - Luke: Nice|0
20-09-17 12:27 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
20-09-17 12:27 - Joost: Can everyone check the text part of the poster 🙂 ?|1
20-09-17 12:28 - Hannes: In the minuts there is a some kind of todo list for friday|1
20-09-17 12:28 - Hannes: I will work on explaininh the mantis-claw|1
20-09-17 12:30 - Natalia: Hm I think we need to edit the "X"s in the requirements. Like put in the actual number of casualties, speed etc? Cause we put X when we didn't know what we would be doing|1
20-09-17 12:31 - Hannes: yes that is indeed important|0
20-09-17 12:32 - Natalia: And maybe remove "difficult to pick up a casualty" from the list of cons. Cause during this presentation we are supposed to prove that we're able to do it and we're kinda writing the opposite on the poster :D|1
20-09-17 12:37 - Hannes: maybe for the requirements:
-at least rescue 1 casualty
-locate the casualty within 60 seconds
-carry 0,25 kg
-reach a velocity of 2 m/s (walking speed)
-less pressure on the casualties so that 0 limbs will be detached (amount of pascal is unknown for the breaking point of the 3d-printed models)
-has to be able to fly for 5 minutes (insted of have a battery with at lest x mAh)|1
20-09-17 12:50 - Natalia: I agree with this list 👍🏻|0
21-09-17 07:53 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
21-09-17 07:53 - Joost: Any more comments on the poster (besides the foto)?|1
21-09-17 07:56 - Hannes: Typo at the requirements zere must be zero|1
21-09-17 07:57 - Hannes: Other than that none|1
21-09-17 07:57 - Hannes: At the presentation should i say something about the mechanics of the mantisclaw?|1
21-09-17 08:00 - Joost: Who are going to be presenting the poster. We need at max 2 persons|1
21-09-17 08:09 - Roos: I think that I made an error in your lastname 🙊|1
21-09-17 08:36 - Hannes: i can talk a bit about the specialisation (mantis claw) and maybe frame but the other things i have lesser knowledge of|1
21-09-17 09:06 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
21-09-17 09:06 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
21-09-17 09:24 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
21-09-17 09:25 - Joost: Hopefully last version of the poster? Anyone any last comments on it?|1
21-09-17 09:25 - Hannes: nope no comments looks great|0
21-09-17 09:30 - Roos: Nice!!|0
21-09-17 09:33 - Luke: Yeah looks great ! 👍🏼|0
21-09-17 09:34 - Hannes: we might have a problem regarding the mantis claw btw|1
21-09-17 09:35 - Hannes: the thickness of the parts that we downloaded and assumed was right was 3 mm|1
21-09-17 09:35 - Hannes: the thickness of the plywood is 4 mm|1
21-09-17 09:35 - Hannes: so the drawings need to be adjusted to the 4 mm otherwise the material are too thick to fit in each other|1
21-09-17 09:36 - Hannes: but im not sure if we can adjust that|1
21-09-17 09:38 - Hannes: luke is there an option to slim plywood in the workplace at vertigo?|1
21-09-17 09:38 - Hannes: with accuracy and not too much trouble ofcourse|1
21-09-17 09:38 - Joost: https://www.amazon.com/Mantis-Drone-Claw-grabber-drone/dp/B019755BUW|1
21-09-17 09:38 - Hannes: that is always an option|1
21-09-17 09:39 - Hannes: and than adjust the claws so it is more humane and we dont buy a whole function|1
21-09-17 09:40 - Joost: The Mantis claw moves outwards when hitting the ground due to that the middle want to go down and forces the arms to go outwards. However when the middle is lifted up the claws will go inwards and stay inwards. I think we can remake the same principle.|1
21-09-17 09:40 - Hannes: well the mechanics of the claw arent that simple to remake but we can try ofcourse|1
21-09-17 09:41 - Joost: But making it thicker is not a problem|1
21-09-17 09:41 - Joost: For the mechanical side|1
21-09-17 09:41 - Hannes: it is a problem|1
21-09-17 09:41 - Hannes: the parts wont fit anymore|1
21-09-17 09:41 - Joost: for the printing side it probably is|1
21-09-17 09:42 - Hannes: well not really for printing|1
21-09-17 09:42 - Hannes: it just wont fit in each other|1
21-09-17 09:42 - Joost: If we make everything bigger?|1
21-09-17 09:42 - Hannes: that is the problem|1
21-09-17 09:42 - Hannes: you cant edit those files|1
21-09-17 09:42 - Hannes: only move|1
21-09-17 09:46 - Joost: 🙁|0
21-09-17 10:36 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
21-09-17 10:37 - Hannes: well here are the parts of the mantis-claw|1
21-09-17 10:37 - Hannes: but still too thick|1
21-09-17 10:43 - Natalia: Love the final prototype, Joost! 👍🏻👍🏻|0
21-09-17 10:49 - Jodi Grooteman: The poster looks nice and also the prototype!|0
21-09-17 10:49 - Jodi Grooteman: Can someone maybe put me in the Dropbox?|1
21-09-17 10:50 - Jodi Grooteman: Then i will print the poster this afternoon|1
21-09-17 10:50 - Hannes: i was responsible for the explanation of mantis-claw but the import to dxf and adjusting took longer than expexted, we still need a prototype for the mantis-claw right?|1
21-09-17 10:50 - Hannes: is there anyone available that can work/help on that part?|1
21-09-17 10:53 - Natalia: I have a really terrible prototype of it and I was asking for the past week if anyone can work on improving it but found no volunteers 😬|1
21-09-17 10:53 - Hannes: well in the meeting i said yes|1
21-09-17 10:53 - Hannes: but i have a bit of trouble with the other tasks i said yes to|1
21-09-17 10:54 - Hannes: and that is the making of the dxf file that gave me a lot of trouble|1
21-09-17 10:54 - Hannes: so i dont have that much time|1
21-09-17 10:55 - Hannes: i can skip the lecture tomorrow and rewatch it in the weekends so i have more time but im not sure if i can fix the dxf-file problem since i cant adjust the parts|1
21-09-17 10:56 - Jodi Grooteman: I want to help but I have never worked with dxf|1
21-09-17 10:56 - Jodi Grooteman: So I dont know if I can help|1
21-09-17 10:56 - Hannes: well we could work on the prototype|1
21-09-17 10:57 - Hannes: that is not software issues|1
21-09-17 10:57 - Hannes: only tinkering haha|1
21-09-17 10:57 - Natalia: Yes that quite a problem with dfx, I hope you can manage it|1
21-09-17 10:57 - Jodi Grooteman: Okay, I want to help then haha|1
21-09-17 10:57 - Natalia: Jodi, yes, maybe you can help|0
21-09-17 10:58 - Hannes: we could push the problem of the software files forward and focus on the mantis-prototype?|1
21-09-17 10:58 - Roos: I have a meeting during the break, after that I could help with the easy stuff haha|1
21-09-17 10:59 - Natalia: I don't know, I mean it doesn't really have to be perfect (the prototype) right?|1
21-09-17 10:59 - Natalia: So maybe the software problem is more important?|1
21-09-17 11:00 - Hannes: it is more important but not for friday|1
21-09-17 11:00 - Natalia: Jodi, what's your email address, I'll add you to the google drive?|1
21-09-17 11:01 - Natalia: Hm yes but we also have a plan B prototype already|1
21-09-17 11:01 - Natalia: So I don't know :)|1
21-09-17 11:04 - Jodi Grooteman: Jodi.grooteman@hotmail.com|1
21-09-17 11:04 - Hannes: luke do you know if there is a machine available to make the plywood thinner?|1
21-09-17 11:04 - Hannes: @31623476352|1
21-09-17 11:06 - Natalia: Jodi, sent you a link|1
21-09-17 11:06 - Jodi Grooteman: Thank you!|0
21-09-17 11:06 - Natalia: So, the way you could help|1
21-09-17 11:06 - Natalia: Go to the drive, to the folder HWA3|1
21-09-17 11:07 - Natalia: Find HWA3 - N.Golova|1
21-09-17 11:07 - Natalia: There are pictures of the mantis claw prototype in the there, the way it is now|1
21-09-17 11:07 - Natalia: So maybe check them out and see if you can make something like that but better :)|1
21-09-17 11:09 - Jodi Grooteman: Okay, i will try haha|0
21-09-17 11:09 - Natalia: 👍🏻😄|0
21-09-17 11:21 - Luke: Im not sure, their are machines to "Sand" plywood But those are not accurate, you have to do that by hand.|1
21-09-17 11:22 - Hannes: is it possible?|1
21-09-17 11:22 - Luke: I am available friday from around 14:00 untill the presentation.|1
21-09-17 11:22 - Hannes: only the end parts are required to be 3 mm|1
21-09-17 11:22 - Luke: Well Maybe if you lasercut everything in 4mm and after lasercutting you could Sand them a little bit untill they fit ?|1
21-09-17 11:23 - Luke: That might be possible But not very accurate|1
21-09-17 11:23 - Hannes: yeah that could work|1
21-09-17 11:23 - Hannes: just trail and error|1
21-09-17 11:23 - Luke: Yes|0
21-09-17 11:23 - Luke: But dont forger, if you wanna lasercut at tue you have to make a reservation|1
21-09-17 11:23 - Hannes: well that fixes the problem of the dxf-files|1
21-09-17 11:24 - Hannes: forger?|1
21-09-17 11:24 - Luke: Glad I could help 👌🏽|0
21-09-17 11:24 - Luke: I mean forget|1
21-09-17 11:24 - Hannes: ah oke|0
21-09-17 11:24 - Hannes: am i allowed to do that?|1
21-09-17 11:24 - Hannes: or do you need to do that?|1
21-09-17 11:24 - Luke: Dont know, Nienke said that Only ID students are allowed at vertigo|1
21-09-17 11:24 - Luke: So I think I have to be with you|1
21-09-17 11:25 - Hannes: ah oke, we have an id in the locker with engineering design on it. can we use that to gain acces?|1
21-09-17 11:25 - Hannes: i heard someone say it but i wasnt sure|1
21-09-17 11:25 - Luke: Im not really sure|1
21-09-17 11:25 - Luke: I think we should Just go to vertigo and ask|1
21-09-17 11:25 - Hannes: yeah indeed|0
21-09-17 11:26 - Luke: But do you want it printted before tomorrow? Because I dont think that will be possible|1
21-09-17 11:27 - Hannes: nope it is not for the prototype|1
21-09-17 11:27 - Luke: Okeay|0
21-09-17 11:27 - Hannes: but for the actual design|1
21-09-17 11:27 - Luke: Maybe we can go to vertigo tomorrow if you have time ?|1
21-09-17 11:28 - Hannes: if that is printed and thinned than we have a working picking up mechanism|1
21-09-17 11:28 - Luke: Just to ask what is possible|1
21-09-17 11:28 - Hannes: well tomorrow i will work with jodi on the prototype so it might be better to work on it another time|1
21-09-17 11:28 - Luke: We can work on the prototype in vertigo ?|1
21-09-17 11:28 - Luke: Than I can join you guys and help|1
21-09-17 11:29 - Hannes: it has 37 components so i think it takes a while to thin it out|1
21-09-17 11:29 - Hannes: ah nice|0
21-09-17 11:29 - Luke: Yeah we wont do that tonorrow|1
21-09-17 11:29 - Luke: I Only mean asking What is possible so that we know that upfront|1
21-09-17 11:29 - Hannes: and we still need to buy bolts for that|1
21-09-17 11:29 - Hannes: ah for the prototype?|1
21-09-17 11:29 - Luke: And Maybe make a reservation for lasercutting next week or something|1
21-09-17 11:30 - Hannes: yeah sure!|0
21-09-17 11:30 - Luke: Plus vertigo is that place to work on prototype|1
21-09-17 11:30 - Hannes: ah me and jodi will be meeting at meta|1
21-09-17 11:30 - Hannes: and than go to action or something for components for prototype|1
21-09-17 11:31 - Luke: Im fine with that but if I where you I would also look at vertigo shop, they have a lot of prototype components over there|1

21-09-17 11:32 - Hannes: ah than we wil begin before that|1
21-09-17 11:32 - Luke: Maybe a little bit earlier|1
21-09-17 11:32 - Hannes: dont know if we could make the prototype if we start at 14|1
21-09-17 11:32 - Luke: I agree|0
21-09-17 11:32 - Luke: You guys can start and I join when my other meeting is finished|1
21-09-17 11:33 - Hannes: yeah sure|0
21-09-17 13:06 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|0
21-09-17 13:06 - Luke: Maybe interesting for us|0
21-09-17 13:06 - Luke: Oow wait 20sep was last wendsday|0

21-09-17 13:08 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|0
21-09-17 13:08 - Luke: Same for this one|0
21-09-17 13:08 - Luke: Learing how to fly a drone would have veen very usefull|0
21-09-17 13:08 - Natalia: Yessss aahhh how did we miss it :(|0
21-09-17 13:08 - Luke: 😪|0
21-09-17 13:09 - Natalia: Sucks|0
21-09-17 13:09 - Natalia: Now we have to learn everything ourselves 😄|0
21-09-17 13:10 - Luke: Jup|0
21-09-17 14:57 - Natalia: Guys, I've reading the course manual and they say the poster should have the chosen specialization function described there and what solution we found for it|1
21-09-17 14:57 - Natalia: And we don't really have it there|1
21-09-17 14:58 - Natalia: *been reading|1
21-09-17 15:01 - Natalia: Also we need to bring and present all 5 prototypes|1
21-09-17 15:04 - Natalia: So I think it would be nice to edit the poster a bit more|1
21-09-17 15:06 - Natalia: Also they say the budget form must be delivered tomorrow too, guess I'm gonna finish that|1
21-09-17 15:07 - Hannes: Well i can talk a bit about the specialized function that is the mantis claw|1
21-09-17 15:08 - Natalia: They say they want it on the poster|1
21-09-17 15:12 - Jodi Grooteman: But I also have to print it almost because the printshop closes at 5 right?|1
21-09-17 15:12 - Natalia: Yes, better print it today|1
21-09-17 15:13 - Natalia: Can you edit the poster, Jodi?|1
21-09-17 15:13 - Natalia: Also they say we need to print a copy of it in A4|1
21-09-17 15:14 - Natalia: And just the photos of the prototype on a separate paper (top and side view)|1
21-09-17 15:16 - Roos: I already filled in the reclaim (the budget form)|1
21-09-17 15:23 - Joost: I can edit the poster|1
21-09-17 15:26 - Natalia: Ok great :)|0
21-09-17 15:59 - Jodi Grooteman: <Media weggelaten>|1
21-09-17 16:00 - Jodi Grooteman: So I print this and the poster in A1 and A4|1
21-09-17 15:48 - Hannes: Is there a hwa deadline for 6 o clock?|1
21-09-17 15:48 - Hannes: Since the preliminary design is tomorrow|1
21-09-17 15:49 - Joost: What do i need to do|1
21-09-17 15:49 - Joost: And there is no deadline|1
21-09-17 15:49 - Hannes: Ah thx|0
21-09-17 15:49 - Joost: But what should I edit with the poster?|1
21-09-17 15:49 - Natalia: Next hwa is till 25th|1
21-09-17 15:50 - Hannes: Maybe a small picture of a mantis claw|1
21-09-17 15:53 - Natalia: Just say something like we wanted to specialize in picking up the casualties that are hard to reach so we chose a drone and a mantis claw that can pick up pretty much any kind of object, so this combo is the best for reaching difficult places|1
21-09-17 15:53 - Natalia: Something like that. But maybe s little more in detail or something|1
21-09-17 15:55 - Hannes: Printshop is open till 8 btw|1
21-09-17 15:59 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
21-09-17 15:59 - Joost: Where should i add text on the poster?|1
21-09-17 16:00 - Natalia: Under the tue logo?|1
21-09-17 16:01 - Joost: That will not look that good 🤔|1
21-09-17 16:02 - Jodi Grooteman: <Media weggelaten>|1
21-09-17 16:02 - Natalia: Poster in a1 and a4|1
21-09-17 16:02 - Natalia: This only in a4|1
21-09-17 16:02 - Jodi Grooteman: So I print this and that yes haha|1
21-09-17 16:02 - Jodi Grooteman: Okay|0
21-09-17 16:07 - Jodi Grooteman: Can I already print?|1
21-09-17 16:08 - Natalia: No, Joost is making one last edit|1
21-09-17 16:09 - Jodi Grooteman: Okay, because it is crowded here so I dont want to wait too long 😬|1
21-09-17 16:10 - Natalia: Damn I'm afraid it's gonna be getting more and more crowded as Friday approaches 🙈|1
21-09-17 16:11 - Jodi Grooteman: Yeah i think that too|0
21-09-17 16:47 - Joost: Uhm|0
21-09-17 16:47 - Joost: I have changed it|1
21-09-17 16:47 - Joost: But not with text|1
21-09-17 16:47 - Joost: I don't know where to put it|1
21-09-17 16:48 - Natalia: Under the tue logo|1
21-09-17 16:48 - Joost: Yeah but then there is random text on the poster....|1
21-09-17 16:49 - Natalia: It's not random, it's pretty important|1
21-09-17 16:50 - Joost: I know....|0
21-09-17 16:50 - Natalia: So what's the problem 😬|1
21-09-17 16:51 - Joost: I know it's important but it is random...|1
21-09-17 16:51 - Natalia: Not sure what you mean|1
21-09-17 16:52 - Joost: All the text is at the bottom and then random text at the top|1
21-09-17 16:53 - Natalia: I don't see the problem in text being in several places on a poster|1
21-09-17 16:55 - Joost: The last version is on the drive so edit what you want 😉|1
21-09-17 16:55 - Roos: I understand what Joost means, that was also my struggle 🙈|0
21-09-17 16:57 - Natalia: Uhm ok I'll edit it|1
21-09-17 17:32 - Natalia: Joost, I've updated it|1
21-09-17 17:32 - Natalia: Now please update the background image there, cause since I don't have it on my computer it became blurry in the poster|1
21-09-17 17:34 - Joost: Photos are always blurry with InDesign, converting it to pdf almost always fixes the problem 😀|1
21-09-17 17:35 - Natalia: Not in this case|1
21-09-17 17:35 - Joost: Okay :(|0
21-09-17 17:35 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
21-09-17 17:36 - Natalia: You like suggesting that I do it myself?|1
21-09-17 17:37 - Joost: Ummm... if you don't want to do it. I will do it later this evening|1
21-09-17 17:40 - Joost: But I hope it's not a problem that this will be around 22.00|1
21-09-17 17:41 - Jodi Grooteman: Uhm yes because im still waiting for printing and tomorrow morning I have no time because im going to work on the prototype|1
21-09-17 17:42 - Natalia: Yeah I did|1
21-09-17 17:42 - Natalia: Jodi you can print|1
21-09-17 17:45 - Jodi Grooteman: Ohh oke nice|0
21-09-17 17:47 - Joost: Who is going to do the presentation of our poster tomorrow?|1
21-09-17 18:44 - Joost: I prefer not doing the presentation|1
21-09-17 18:49 - Natalia: Me neither 😬|1
21-09-17 18:56 - Jodi Grooteman: Me neither|1
21-09-17 18:56 - Jodi Grooteman: Ik have printed the poster enz|1
21-09-17 18:57 - Joost: YEAH 😁😁😁👍🏼|0
21-09-17 19:05 - Natalia: 👍🏻👍🏻|0
21-09-17 19:43 - Roos: I also prefer not doing the presentation 😇|1
21-09-17 19:44 - Luke: Hahaha someone has to present 😂|0
21-09-17 19:45 - Luke: I dont wouldnt mind presenting except I missed like all off last week so I dont know everything|1
21-09-17 19:49 - Natalia: I mainly said no cause I'm still ill and would make a bad public speaker in this state 😔|1
21-09-17 19:49 - Natalia: It would be great if you do that Luke 👍🏻|0
21-09-17 19:49 - Joost: I can join building the prototype at 12.45|1
21-09-17 19:50 - Luke: Well I prefer someone else Because Im Just not up te date about everything|1
21-09-17 19:50 - Joost: Besides the landing mechanism nothing has been changed on the design|1
21-09-17 19:54 - Luke: I Just prefer someone else. I Just always have to present in every group because I am always the one that doesnt mind :p I would like someone else te present for a time :p|1
21-09-17 19:55 - Joost: I understand and think it's very reasonable 😉|0
21-09-17 19:55 - Joost: I think Natalia and Jodi are not an option, Hannes wants to present the frame and some more things, so than we have 3 people left to fill in the rest|1
21-09-17 19:56 - Natalia: I think everyone has been doing quite a lot of work this week, with design etc. and since you didn't regally participate would be nice if you do the presentation :)|1
21-09-17 19:56 - Joost: Well I disagree|1
21-09-17 19:56 - Luke: I was sick, was not like I didnt want to help :p|1
21-09-17 19:56 - Natalia: So was I and still am|1
21-09-17 19:57 - Luke: Than you probally werent as sick as I was :p|1
21-09-17 19:57 - Joost: Sorry but this doesn't matter it is up to Roos or me|1
21-09-17 19:58 - Natalia: Okay if you think so :)|1
21-09-17 19:58 - Luke: But again I dont mind presenting I Just prefer not doing it Because I miss some off the information and because I literally present in every project|1
21-09-17 19:58 - Luke: But if you really dont want it than again I dont mind and I will do it|1
21-09-17 19:59 - Joost: That would be the most reasonable in my opinion, but I don't want to be rude,but I think I can and did contribute more till know on other  parts.  so therefore I would like Roos to do the presentation. But if she refuses I will do it|1
21-09-17 20:00 - Joost: (With that I mean that it's up to roos or me)|1
21-09-17 20:00 - Luke: Hu I dont fallow it anymore 😂|1
21-09-17 20:01 - Luke: I dont wanna force people and I know I didnt contribute enough this week and I will make up for that|1
21-09-17 20:03 - Joost: You were sick and missed things. So you should not do the presentation in my opinion 😉|1
21-09-17 20:26 - Hannes: I can present but im not good at it|1
21-09-17 20:27 - Hannes: I dont mind that much but im not good at it|1
21-09-17 20:28 - Luke: Well I will present if someone joins me ?|1
21-09-17 20:33 - Hannes: Yeah sure|1
21-09-17 20:33 - Hannes: We can discuss ut tomorrow who does what|1
21-09-17 20:42 - Natalia: https://youtu.be/735_W3zsIw4|1
21-09-17 20:43 - Natalia: Basically what we're gonna be doing 😆|1
21-09-17 20:49 - Joost: Hahahhaa|0
22-09-17 09:29 - Natalia: Guys, where is the design fair gonna take place?|1
22-09-17 09:35 - Hannes: I dont know exactly|1
22-09-17 09:37 - Joost: Today we are building the Mantis Claw right? I can join at around 13.30 (it's later because I need to pick some things up at my home)


The PD is in the market hall at MetaForum|1
22-09-17 09:39 - Hannes: Yeah me and jodi will start in 20 minutes|1
22-09-17 09:40 - Natalia: Thank you Joost!|0
22-09-17 09:41 - Joost: We do our presentation at board 50|1
22-09-17 11:46 - Luke: How are you guys doing?|1
22-09-17 12:09 - Hannes: Oke i guess it will not be a great prototype but you can show the mechanism|1
22-09-17 12:14 - Joost: Do you need some help?|1
22-09-17 12:14 - Hannes: Not really|1
22-09-17 12:14 - Hannes: Maybe with a script for the presentation|1
22-09-17 12:19 - Hannes: How realistiv does the prototype needs to be?|1
22-09-17 12:20 - Hannes: It can help with the explanation of the mechanism|1
22-09-17 12:21 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1|1
22-09-17 12:27 - Hannes: What are we going to do with presentating? Are we going to make a script and follow that?|1
22-09-17 12:27 - Hannes: Luke shall we meet in meta at half past one?|1
22-09-17 12:51 - Luke: I am finished now|1
22-09-17 12:51 - Luke: So Where you wannan meet|1
22-09-17 12:52 - Luke: I do need to lunch, someone wanna join me lunchen at subway or something? 😄✌🏼|1
22-09-17 12:53 - Hannes: Yeah sure am at home but i will be there in 15 minutes or so|1

22-09-17 12:54 - Luke: Maybe we can meed at auditorium?|1
22-09-17 12:55 - Luke: If you like to eat subway? Or do you prefer something else ?|1
22-09-17 13:09 - Hannes: We are at the subway|1
22-09-17 13:10 - Luke: At vertigo ?|1
22-09-17 13:11 - Luke: Audi I mean|1
22-09-17 13:13 - Hannes: At audi yes|1
22-09-17 13:27 - Joost: How late should we meet with the whole group? To prepare some things etc|1
22-09-17 13:31 - Natalia: Is anyone bringing the tape to hang the poster?|1
22-09-17 13:31 - Jodi Grooteman: Does the budget claim thing also has to be printed?|1
22-09-17 13:31 - Joost: I think so|1
22-09-17 13:31 - Hannes: Uhm me jodi and luke are already at the uni|1
22-09-17 13:32 - Joost: Okay I will be there at 14u|1
22-09-17 13:32 - Hannes: Are you at home?|1
22-09-17 13:32 - Roos: I have the reclaim form, that is for the budget|1
22-09-17 13:32 - Hannes: Ah nice|0
22-09-17 13:32 - Joost: Yeah I'm still at home|1
22-09-17 13:32 - Jodi Grooteman: Okay, nice|0
22-09-17 13:33 - Natalia: I'll come at 16|1
22-09-17 13:33 - Joost: I can bring tape|1
22-09-17 13:33 - Natalia: Oki 👍🏻|0
22-09-17 13:42 - Joost: Where are you in about 5 minutes?|1
22-09-17 13:49 - Joost: Where are you now?|1
22-09-17 13:54 - Joost: I'm at the university so where are you?|1
22-09-17 14:02 - Hannes: We are at gemininoord|1
22-09-17 14:02 - Hannes: Across the bridge|1
22-09-17 14:02 - Hannes: Ogo space 16|1
22-09-17 14:02 - Hannes: Sorry for late answer|0
22-09-17 14:57 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
22-09-17 15:16 - Roos: <Media weggelaten>|1
22-09-17 15:17 - Roos: I am also coming soon btw|1
22-09-17 15:42 - Roos: Are you still at gemini?|1
22-09-17 15:42 - Luke: No|1
22-09-17 15:42 - Luke: At metaforum|1
22-09-17 15:50 - Roos: Inside?|1
22-09-17 15:50 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
22-09-17 15:50 - Luke: No in front of it|1
22-09-17 15:50 - Luke: On a bench|1
22-09-17 18:57 - Hannes: hi all shall we make new subjects for the hwa?|1
22-09-17 18:57 - Hannes: what do we need?|1
22-09-17 18:58 - Hannes: we should have a list of all parts with how much they cost each but i think natalia already made that right?|1
22-09-17 18:58 - Hannes: we need someone working on the report for gathering all the data we already have|1
22-09-17 18:59 - Hannes: maybe two can do that?|1
22-09-17 18:59 - Hannes: maybe we should start looking at the arduino and start programming some stuff or make an inventory of what needs to be programmed|1
22-09-17 19:00 - Hannes: if there is nothing more to do i might want to add some weight reduction with the frame, since i think it can be made smaller|1
22-09-17 19:04 - Jodi Grooteman: I want to work on the report|1
22-09-17 19:04 - Luke: I like the arduino or the list?|1
22-09-17 19:04 - Jodi Grooteman: Or is it not the idea that we choose ourselfs 🙈|0
22-09-17 19:05 - Luke: Maybe I can take Nathalie's list and look for the cheapest prices and compared the with the netherlands and find out how long delivery takes for each part ?|1
22-09-17 19:06 - Hannes: Yeah we could do that|0
22-09-17 19:08 - Luke: I can do that or I can look into arduino programming, depends on What Natalie prefers because she started the list but she is also the programmer.|1
22-09-17 19:36 - Natalia: Luke, I think it would be great if you could look for the cheapest prices for the parts, basically we should find as many parts as we can from the Dutch shops|1
22-09-17 19:37 - Natalia: The list is on the drive, but I'm gonna edit a couple of things a bit later, like I think we need a slightly better battery and a different powerboard|1
22-09-17 19:37 - Natalia: But the other parts are correct|1
22-09-17 19:39 - Luke: Okeay I will look in to that 👍🏼|1
22-09-17 19:39 - Luke: Probally will do that this sunday|1
22-09-17 19:39 - Luke: Do you wanna look in to arduino together? Because I also like to learn more about that, maybe we can work on that together upcoming weeks ?|1
22-09-17 19:41 - Natalia: For programming I'm gonna think about what we can do at this point, cause really the most programming is after we get the parts such as motors and gyro, cause first we need to connect them all in one circuit|1
22-09-17 19:42 - Luke: I know|0
22-09-17 19:43 - Luke: Maybe we both can look for some information about programming the drone/arduino this week seperstly just to prepare for when the stuf arrives|1
22-09-17 19:44 - Natalia: Yes sounds good 👌🏻|1
22-09-17 19:44 - Natalia: Cause arduino yun is a bit different from others|1
22-09-17 19:44 - Natalia: Cause of the wifi connection|1
22-09-17 19:44 - Natalia: So this is something to read up on :)|0
22-09-17 19:45 - Luke: Agree|0
22-09-17 19:46 - Luke: Lest both just find information about the programming part for next hwa and after that we can compare our info?|1
22-09-17 19:47 - Hannes: Nice!|0
22-09-17 19:48 - Hannes: I can look if i can make the frame lighter and see if i can look for something that will counter the vibratiobs within the aluminum since it will cibrate due to the propellers and motors|1
22-09-17 19:48 - Luke: Sounds good|0
22-09-17 19:49 - Luke: And Maybe someone can also look into the mantis claw|1
22-09-17 19:49 - Natalia: Yes Luke, sounds good|0
22-09-17 19:49 - Luke: How we could make it more human ect|1
22-09-17 19:50 - Natalia: And Hannes too, definitely would be great to think about that frame design. Maybe try the h frame :)|1
22-09-17 19:50 - Luke: Yeah and Swatch Google for existing frames and maybe try to make something similar|1
22-09-17 19:55 - Luke: *Search|1
22-09-17 19:58 - Hannes: Oke i will write down the plans i have for the humane part|1
22-09-17 19:58 - Hannes: And i will look if i can design the frame differently|1
22-09-17 19:59 - Luke: And btw, again good presentation Hannes 👌🏽|0
22-09-17 19:59 - Roos: I can also have a look at the report if that is necessary haha|1
22-09-17 19:59 - Hannes: Thx!|0
22-09-17 19:59 - Natalia: Yes they say the report is like super important|1
22-09-17 19:59 - Natalia: So the more you write there the better :)|1
22-09-17 19:59 - Luke: Yeah the report is everything|1
22-09-17 20:02 - Hannes: Yeah you can collaberate with jodi and see what needs to be done what is done and maybe rewrite some stuff so it is better english and better formulated or something|1
22-09-17 20:03 - Luke: Yeah and if you need certain parts you could ask who works on that part to make a certain text|1
22-09-17 20:05 - Hannes: Yes indeed|0
23-09-17 13:04 - Joost: Is there anything I can contribute to for the next meeting. I lost the overview 😉|1
23-09-17 13:08 - Luke: - Mantis claw (Hannes)
- Frame (Hannes)
- Report (Roos & Jodi)
- Shoppinglist (Luke)
- Arduino coding (Luke & Natalie)|1
23-09-17 13:08 - Luke: Something like this at the moment right ?|1
23-09-17 13:11 - Joost: So I could focus on the landing mechanism in collobaration with Hannes?|1
23-09-17 13:11 - Luke: Yeah sounds like an idea|1
23-09-17 13:12 - Hannes: Yeah sure|1
25-09-17 15:47 - Jodi Grooteman: Heeey|0
25-09-17 15:47 - Jodi Grooteman: Where do I need to submit my hwa?|1
25-09-17 15:47 - Hannes: on canvas at engineering design|1
25-09-17 15:48 - Jodi Grooteman: Mail to our tutor?|1
25-09-17 15:48 - Hannes: at assignments|1
25-09-17 15:48 - Jodi Grooteman: Ohh oke|0
25-09-17 15:48 - Hannes: make sure it is in pdf|1
25-09-17 15:48 - Hannes: otherwise they wont read it|1
25-09-17 15:48 - Jodi Grooteman: Ohh thanks for saying that|0
25-09-17 15:50 - Hannes: no problem :)|0
25-09-17 16:38 - Jodi Grooteman: But I dont have to mail our tutor?|1
25-09-17 16:38 - Jodi Grooteman: Because she said that last time?|1
25-09-17 16:48 - Joost: We did not have to do that|1
25-09-17 16:48 - Jodi Grooteman: Okayy|0
25-09-17 19:35 - Joost: Maybe an useful reminder: Natalia is the chairwoman😉 tomorrow and Jodi the secretary|1
25-09-17 19:40 - Natalia: Wasn't Roos supposed to be the secretary?|1
25-09-17 19:41 - Joost: Ive changed the planning at 17 september because you and Luuk were ill|1
25-09-17 19:45 - Natalia: Hm yes, like Roos should have been the secretary last time, but she was the chairwoman and so she'll be the secretary this time?|1
25-09-17 20:51 - Roos: When we switched, jodi was also added to the planning. I think that is why she will be secretary next meeting|1
26-09-17 11:30 - Luke: Where do we have meeting ?|1
26-09-17 11:30 - Hannes: Vertigo right?|1
26-09-17 11:31 - Luke: You sure ?|1
26-09-17 11:31 - Hannes: Well im heading that way and i just saw roos heading that way so i guess haha|1
26-09-17 11:32 - Hannes: All tuesdays were at 9.08 i thought|1
26-09-17 11:32 - Luke: Okeay|0
26-09-17 11:37 - Joost: We need to be at vertigo 9.08A|1
26-09-17 11:38 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
26-09-17 13:51 - Roos: Did you divide some more important hwas?|1
26-09-17 13:53 - Roos: I am so sorry that I had to leave, but I have a meeting for my commission (if this is an english word) every tuesday during the break|1
26-09-17 14:02 - Natalia: Basically, Joost and Hannes are doing frame and landing, you and Luke the mantis claw, Jodi the report and I'll order the parts :)|1
26-09-17 14:16 - Roos: Okay thanks 😊|0
26-09-17 14:54 - Joost: Hannes and I are going to look into the frame tomorrow. I think its best if we print the frame as fast as possible. So we will be finishing the frame and hopefull the landing mechanism as well tomorrow.|1
26-09-17 14:57 - Natalia: Sounds good!|0
26-09-17 14:59 - Luke: Sounds Good|0
26-09-17 15:09 - Joost: I am reading the Hardware document and there is stated that we are not allowed to work in the workshop ourselves. This holds for laser cutting of plywood, sawing and drilling of aluminium profile, soldering of electric parts. We have to send an email to workshop4wbb0@tue.nl with our group number and a pdf/dxf file with our group number and name of piece. Within three workdays the parts will be in our locker. We need to order before 1 October 20:00. After 1 October it cant be guaranteed that they will do it for you.
So Luuk can't Laserprint the plywood by himself. Therefore we should maybe change some HWA again 🙁 .|1
26-09-17 15:10 - Luke: Yeah I Just wasted to send you a message about that|1
26-09-17 15:11 - Luke: They changed the rules since this year a fallow student Just told me|1
26-09-17 15:11 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
26-09-17 15:11 - Luke: Last year I was allowed to saw and Sand ect myself|1
26-09-17 15:11 - Luke: Now I first need to do a curses before I am allowed|1
26-09-17 15:14 - Luke: So what should we do? We can mail them you file @31650972942  and if we get all the parts we could also sand them by hand using sandpaper?|1
26-09-17 15:14 - Joost: Probably|1
26-09-17 15:14 - Luke: If you send the file today we will have them maybe friday?|1
26-09-17 15:15 - Luke: Then I could take them and sand them with paper sunday?|1
26-09-17 15:15 - Natalia: So the frame should also be ordered before October 1st?|1
26-09-17 15:15 - Joost: Yes|1
26-09-17 15:15 - Luke: Yeah I gues|1
26-09-17 15:16 - Luke: But this means I cant work on the claw before at least friday because they wont be finished|1
26-09-17 15:16 - Joost: Therefore Hannes and I are going to finish it tomorrow|1
26-09-17 15:17 - Luke: Is there something else I could do before friday?|1
26-09-17 15:17 - Natalia: Do they make holes in aluminum of a certain size or any size?|1
26-09-17 15:17 - Joost: 4.2mm|1
26-09-17 15:17 - Joost: in diameter|1
26-09-17 15:22 - Hannes: well we could reduce it ourselves but it would take a lot more time without professional equipment|1
26-09-17 15:22 - Hannes: and the holes have the right diameter|1
26-09-17 15:25 - Roos: So we are not able to do the laserprinting and the mantis claw this week?|1
26-09-17 15:35 - Joost: We are not able to have it within this week. We will get it like Monday or Tuesday next week probably. It depends on when we send it to them.|1
26-09-17 15:46 - Roos: Ahh okay, is there anything else we can do?|1
26-09-17 16:02 - Jodi Grooteman: What is the email of our tutor?|1
26-09-17 16:11 - Natalia: Don't remember but her name is nienke lastdrager, so you can find that from outlook contacts|1
26-09-17 16:18 - Jodi Grooteman: Okay, thanks|0
27-09-17 08:01 - Luke: Just to be sure, Hannes and Joost you are going to mail for the mantis claw to be printed?|1
27-09-17 08:03 - Luke: Because than for this HWA I would like to make a step by step plan of how we have to make the drone, this plan I am going to discuss with Natalie on monday and than we should have a plan that everyone understands|1
27-09-17 08:03 - Luke: And that can be placed in the report|1
27-09-17 08:13 - Hannes: Yeah thst is a good idea|0
27-09-17 08:37 - Joost: That sounds like a very goed idea|0
27-09-17 11:02 - Joost: We looked into two different frames. The H shape and the old shape. The H shape weighs 4 grams less, however it is more unstable. Therefore we chose to stay with the old design.|1
27-09-17 11:03 - Luke: Agree|0
27-09-17 11:53 - Roos: Do you know anything that I can do, as we do not have to laserprint anymore? Otherwise I will probably only be reading that documents on the drive and I do not know whether that is enough 🙈|1
27-09-17 11:54 - Luke: Maybe you can read those things and as a HWA deepen in to one of them ? So that you can pick a direction which you wanna focus on/work on like we discussed last meeting ?|1
27-09-17 11:59 - Roos: Yeah that is kind of what I meant haha|0
27-09-17 12:03 - Luke: I think that would be smart|0
27-09-17 12:03 - Luke: Maybe then you can tell us which technical part you would like to do/ contribute to ?|1
27-09-17 12:03 - Luke: Next meeting I mean|1
27-09-17 12:31 - Hannes: well we have a problem, last monday there was a video online on how the dxf-file needs to look like, that is the file for the laser printing of the mantis claw. The file needs to have sketches only and the imported file of the mantis-claw doesnt meet those constraints. So i dont think those people accept the files, so the mantis-claw maybe needs to be drawn again from scratch. The deadline for that is the first of oktober and i think i can manage to do that but still would take a lot of time. It would be faster to make it myself since the nx-drawings are a bit hard to start with and i have a bit of hours in it, so i think it would be faster if i would do it myself. Is it okey for me to do a bit less after this problem and deadline? 😇 I want to focus on other subjects aswell. I think i will be able to finish it by friday|1
27-09-17 12:37 - Luke: Try to do as much as you can, if you putt in more time now than offcourse it aint a problem if you putt in less another week|1
27-09-17 12:37 - Luke: Just make sure that overal you putted in enough|1
27-09-17 12:39 - Joost: I will draw the aluminium parts on paper, because siemens nx is acting very annoying.|1
27-09-17 12:54 - Hannes: Look at the hardware file to see what kind of files are allowed and if paper is allowed first|1
27-09-17 12:54 - Joost: You can make your own sketches, scan it en deliver it in a pdf-file|1
27-09-17 12:57 - Hannes: Ohh|0
27-09-17 13:09 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
27-09-17 13:11 - Hannes: That would save a lot of time|0
27-09-17 13:12 - Joost: 🙂|0
27-09-17 14:31 - Natalia: <Media weggelaten>|1
27-09-17 14:31 - Natalia: They have finally decided to answer my email 😆|1
27-09-17 14:32 - Hannes: haha nice|0
27-09-17 16:32 - Natalia: Hannes, how much do you think the frame is gonna weigh at this point?|1
27-09-17 16:32 - Hannes: Joost you have calculated that right?|1
27-09-17 16:33 - Hannes: Joost has that somewhere written down|1
27-09-17 16:33 - Hannes: Do you need it now?|1
27-09-17 16:33 - Natalia: Cause I've encountered some complications|1
27-09-17 16:33 - Hannes: Than i can calculate it again|1
27-09-17 16:33 - Natalia: Like the motors that I wanted to order might take 20 business days to arrive|1
27-09-17 16:34 - Natalia: So I need a different motor now|1
27-09-17 16:34 - Natalia: And the one that is an option needs a smaller propeller|1
27-09-17 16:34 - Natalia: 9.4 inches instead of 10.5|1
27-09-17 16:35 - Hannes: Ah oke we can make the frame smaller than|1
27-09-17 16:35 - Hannes: I will calculate it|1
27-09-17 16:35 - Natalia: Which means the whole weight should go down|1
27-09-17 16:35 - Natalia: So can you calculate now so I can see if these propellers are an option?|1
27-09-17 16:38 - Natalia: Also if you have the planned weight for the landing system and the mantis claw that would also be very helpful!|1
27-09-17 16:38 - Hannes: i will calculate it now for the 9.4 inches|1
27-09-17 16:39 - Natalia: Thank you!|0
27-09-17 16:41 - Joost: The weight right now is 175 grams|1
27-09-17 16:42 - Natalia: Thanks, that's good, and the landing and the claw?|1
27-09-17 16:43 - Joost: Landing mechanism depends on the material|1
27-09-17 16:43 - Hannes: the frame would be 167 g|1
27-09-17 16:44 - Joost: I think it was something like 60 grams. I don't know for sure (you can look it up in drive landing mechanism) I do not have the research in front of me|1
27-09-17 16:44 - Hannes: exluding the bolts|1
27-09-17 16:45 - Natalia: Okay thanks guys, let me see if that fits|1
27-09-17 16:45 - Natalia: Wait, still need the weight of the claw :)|1
27-09-17 16:45 - Hannes: hmm i dont think i can calculate that yet|1
27-09-17 16:45 - Luke: We dont have a final design of the claw right|1
27-09-17 16:46 - Luke: So that would be a gues|0
27-09-17 16:46 - Hannes: im making that now|1
27-09-17 16:46 - Hannes: im at 1/5 of that|1
27-09-17 16:48 - Natalia: Can we say approximately? :)|1
27-09-17 16:48 - Natalia: Like can we keep it under 200g?|1
27-09-17 16:49 - Hannes: im really not sure but i would guess around 100 g-150 g|1
27-09-17 16:49 - Hannes: but that would be a wild guess|1
27-09-17 16:49 - Hannes: so could also be 50 g more|1
27-09-17 16:51 - Natalia: Ok thanks. Yes I get it, this whole component building thing is a bit of guess in any case :)|1
27-09-17 16:52 - Hannes: if i have all of the sketches done i can calculate it roughly|1
27-09-17 18:11 - Natalia: Okay guys, so the budget is turning out like that:
80 total component price;
23 shipping;
This makes 33 euro extra or 5.5 each. Everyone agrees?|1
27-09-17 18:19 - Natalia: Guys please respond :)|1
27-09-17 18:21 - Hannes: Uhm well wont they ask how the components would be that cheap if we exlude shipping cost?|1
27-09-17 18:21 - Hannes: Otherwhise in ok for the 5,50|1
27-09-17 18:22 - Joost: I wonder about the extra taxes that we may get 🤔|1
27-09-17 18:22 - Natalia: We could say we did free shipping. Cause free shipping is an option, it just takes a couple of months :)|1
27-09-17 18:23 - Natalia: Well, I received an order from Singapore yesterday, no tax came with it so far :D|1
27-09-17 18:24 - Joost: That sounds good 😁|0
27-09-17 18:26 - Luke: But what are we going to say about the 80|1
27-09-17 18:26 - Luke: Beaucse we are Only allowed a budget of 70|1
27-09-17 18:26 - Luke: And there probally will come more costs|1
27-09-17 18:27 - Natalia: Well I kinda doubt they'll ask for receipt?|1
27-09-17 18:27 - Luke: I dont know|0
27-09-17 18:29 - Natalia: Cause yeah I can probably cut 10 euro and get something of a lesser quality that might burn in the process. And then we'll be short on time and will have to get the same thing from the Netherlands which will cost like extra 40|1
27-09-17 18:29 - Natalia: So in my opinion cutting anything from here is not worth it|1
27-09-17 18:30 - Natalia: Much easier to forge the numbers a little :)|1
27-09-17 18:33 - Joost: I don't like the fact of paying extra, however I want this project to work.  Moreover we don't have enough time to wait with this decision for a couple of days so I'm feeling pressured to say yes. Maybe if you (Natalia) could share the links of all parts you want to buy, everyone who wants too can look this evening in to them and maybe find better options, if not, we buy the things Natalia found.|1
27-09-17 18:35 - Natalia: Yeah basically would be nice to order like right now..|1
27-09-17 18:35 - Natalia: But sure|0
27-09-17 18:36 - Natalia: https://www.banggood.com/Matek-Mini-Power-Hub-Power-Distribution-Board-With-BEC-5V-And-12V-For-FPV-Multicopter-p-1005549.html|1

27-09-17 18:38 - Natalia: That's it|0
27-09-17 18:40 - Natalia: And once again, can everyone please respond on paying 5.5 extra. Girls?|1
27-09-17 18:41 - Joost: The service of banggood.com is good,however i see lots and lots of people saying there stuff got delivered the first time wrong. Then communicating with the service and they got a new one. I hope this will not be in our case 😕|1
27-09-17 18:41 - Joost: Because this will take a lot of time right?|1
27-09-17 18:43 - Natalia: That's the best we can get. And yesterday I got an order from them and it was all good. But I also made an order on another site (dx.com) 10 days ago and hardly any news, so this one not an option. eBay and similar too risky. So basically bangood is our best option so far|1
27-09-17 18:44 - Natalia: The shipping is dhl 5-8 business days and that's the max we can wait at this point|1
27-09-17 18:44 - Natalia: Or we'll have no time to do the actual work|1
27-09-17 18:47 - Luke: I Agree with the money|1
27-09-17 18:47 - Luke: I dont mind|1
27-09-17 20:24 - Jodi Grooteman: Yeah its okay|0
27-09-17 20:39 - Joost: It's not okay for me|1
27-09-17 20:40 - Natalia: Seriously now?|1
27-09-17 21:12 - Joost: I do not agree breaking our constraints. If we get caught we probably have a huge problem, so therefore I am not okay with paying 80 euro's for the drone parts.|1
27-09-17 21:29 - Natalia: Well. I can cut off about 6 euro on the expense of quality. Or feel free to find the same components at a lower price?|1
27-09-17 22:07 - Joost: I can't find the components at a lower price. Therefore we need to look at other solutions|1
27-09-17 22:09 - Joost: I believe we had lots of examples on YouTube with a budget under 70 euro's. We should look into that in my opinion|1
27-09-17 22:13 - Joost: I hope everyone agrees with the fact that we should at least keep the drone under 70 euro's (shipping costs whatever), because it is one of our constraints...|1
27-09-17 22:20 - Hannes: Maybe ask the tutor before that|1
27-09-17 22:20 - Hannes: If it is okay to do that as a discussion point i think it would be better|1
27-09-17 22:20 - Hannes: Im not letting natalia buy 80 euros for parts we should use...|1
27-09-17 22:22 - Joost: I agree, however I don't think Nienke will say it's okay, because it's state very clearly in the course manual. But we can of course try|1
27-09-17 22:24 - Hannes: I think it would be okay if we would state in the report in discussion that there were some troubles with shipping costs. Other than that i think we should rather vote on how we should tackle this|1
27-09-17 22:52 - Natalia: Guys, I really don't understand the problem. How do you think they are gonna know exactly how much we've paid? It's a freaking 10 euro difference, not like we had a budget of 70 and ordered for 500. They ask for a receipt, you print the right amount on the receipt and you're done. Or you can say you bought some parts from a friend for 5 euro. They have 300 groups, do you really expect them to interrogate us about every cent? And yeah, Nienke will of course say no, because well, that's her job.|1
27-09-17 22:53 - Joost: The problem is that we break the rules|1
27-09-17 22:54 - Natalia: Read the rest of my text please :)|1
27-09-17 22:54 - Joost: I did|0
27-09-17 22:54 - Joost: You said we could do it within 70 euros|1
27-09-17 22:55 - Natalia: It doesn't look like you're reading what I've just wrote.|1
27-09-17 22:55 - Natalia: We break the rules, so what?|1
27-09-17 22:55 - Joost: Moreover its not fair to other groups|1
27-09-17 22:56 - Natalia: Well that's really what we should care about|1
27-09-17 22:57 - Hannes: Im going to side with natalia on this one|1
27-09-17 22:57 - Hannes: And if the majority will want to make new order we should consult nienke first|1
27-09-17 23:00 - Joost: I thought we had multiple examples of people who did it within 70 euro's? Moreover I stated several times that it will not be possible within the 70 euro's which was countered with examples. I do not see these examples anywhere...?
At last we agreed that it will probably fail,because as I said it will not be possible within the budget. So or you could stop being angry at me for disagreeing, or you could show the counter examples and we will work on that.
Sorry I'm getting very annoyed by the fact that I am getting forced to pay for something I did never agree too|1
27-09-17 23:01 - Natalia: Thank you Hannes! Yes, would be nice to hear what the rest of the group thinks too|1
27-09-17 23:01 - Hannes: Those examples were not in the same weight ratio and therefore require lesser motors|1
27-09-17 23:01 - Joost: Yes that was said|0
27-09-17 23:03 - Luke: What is for you the problem? That you have to pay more or that we break the "rules"?|1
27-09-17 23:03 - Luke: Because I also think the problem is not 10euro more or less for the rules but more like id you pay way above budget|1
27-09-17 23:04 - Luke: I dont think they will notice a 10 euro difference|1
27-09-17 23:05 - Joost: The fact that I'm feeling forced to pay makes me annoyed. And that it's not within the rules makes me insecure of finishing this course due to fraud|1
27-09-17 23:05 - Luke: Noone forces you|1
27-09-17 23:06 - Joost: I know, but when I say I want to think about it, I receive a time pressuring text and when I say I disagree I receive "Seriously now?"|1
27-09-17 23:06 - Luke: But if you wanna have a second look I understand, than we should look at a way to do it for less. But I do think that we will always be a bit above budget and I also think every group will have that|1
27-09-17 23:07 - Natalia: Joost, you're now being asked to pay extra 5.5 euro including shipping. Not including shipping it's 2 euro. The prices of these components are very volatile, what I checked a week ago and what I see now is different. If I try to order in 3 days it will probably be different again (because Chinese websites). So feel free to blame me for doing all this research for days and first telling you 70 and now 80, cause trust me, I can if you really insist bring it down to 70 but no one is gonna like it because it will mean something is at risk of not working or not arriving at time and just not worth it. That is the difference between an estimate and the final ultimate price.|1
27-09-17 23:09 - Luke: I do agree with Natalie on this, school wont check that Because its True that prices change|1
27-09-17 23:09 - Luke: But we have to make sure that we dont have to pay again for other parts Because than it will get to "obviously" expensive|1
27-09-17 23:11 - Joost: Im sorry, but i did not want to blame you at all for the research you did. I value your effort, ofcourse
However I don't  like the way that my scepticism and my lack of knowledge are answered.|1
27-09-17 23:16 - Natalia: Well if you're not happy with the results, you can always watch all the YouTube videos, make your own calculations and find the necessary parts.|1
27-09-17 23:17 - Joost: I don't understand what you mean?|1
27-09-17 23:18 - Natalia: Well you say you don't like my budget and configuration, then you obviously can make a better one that will fit all the rules|1
27-09-17 23:21 - Hannes: We could just say that we were putting it at risk with shipping delivery and thereforr have a cheaper price?|1
27-09-17 23:22 - Natalia: How do you mean, Hannes? Didn't quite understand :)|1
27-09-17 23:24 - Hannes: Oh i thiught if you put the shipping date longer than you would pay less|1
27-09-17 23:24 - Hannes: Or just wait and screenshot the components when they have a lower price and say we ordered those?|1
27-09-17 23:28 - Natalia: Yes, we can show them that we used free shipping while we don't. But we really can't use free shipping in reality cause the stuff will arrive in November basically|1
27-09-17 23:28 - Natalia: Or December. Or never. The options are limitless with the Chinese websites :)|1
27-09-17 23:29 - Hannes: Oh haha but could they notice?|1
27-09-17 23:29 - Natalia: And yes we can show them the wrong screenshots, I can even photoshop them if you like :D|1
27-09-17 23:30 - Natalia: You can say your uncle is an electrician and you bought this stuff from his garage sale. That's not against the rules I think 🤔😆|1
27-09-17 23:31 - Hannes: Haha well if we can buy one part from someones uncle|1
27-09-17 23:34 - Jodi Grooteman: I agree with Joost that it is weird that we have to pay more when we have a budget for it and officially can't exceed it. But  I also think that this is the cheapest option|1
28-09-17 07:30 - Roos: Whow I missed quite a lot last night. I think this is the best option, otherwise the project will almost fail immediately haha if we have the wrong parts of nothing at all. However, I dont know if we had to hand in the receipts, but then they will notice it. Or do you want to change the prices then?|1
28-09-17 09:32 - Joost: We are going to chance the prices, it's not so hard to do 😉|1
28-09-17 09:33 - Hannes: doe we exactly know how to fill in the budget form? do we need to have a receipt for anything?|1
28-09-17 09:34 - Joost: There is no other document besides the course manual about the budget|1
28-09-17 09:35 - Hannes: soo if we scratch two motors a bit and say they were second hand and therefore 10 euros cheaper it is fine i guess?|1
28-09-17 09:36 - Luke: I Agree|1
28-09-17 09:36 - Joost: – Finalize BOM link price column prepare your grocery list to launch (leave some buffer in
the budget)
This is the last thing they say about the BOM  (Bill Of Materials)|1
28-09-17 09:37 - Joost: The rest is all like: look if it fits within the budget, blabla|1
28-09-17 12:18 - Joost: I concluded that my scanner is worse then a photo. Therefore I made photos of the frame and uploaded two of each. If you think one is better then the other, please delete the other one :)|1
28-09-17 12:19 - Joost: Moreover I would like to remind that Jodi will be the next chairwoman and Roos the secretary|1
28-09-17 15:49 - Hannes: good news i managed to complete the mantis-claw faster than i thought|1
28-09-17 15:50 - Hannes: it is complete now|1
28-09-17 15:57 - Jodi Grooteman: Nicee 👍|0
28-09-17 16:03 - Hannes: yes :)|0
28-09-17 16:20 - Luke: Nice !!!!|0
28-09-17 16:29 - Roos: Nice Hannes!!|0
28-09-17 16:36 - Natalia: Awesome 👍🏻👍🏻|0
28-09-17 22:58 - Jodi Grooteman: Tomorrow we have meeting at 16:45 Pav P8 right?|1
28-09-17 23:10 - Joost: Yes|1
28-09-17 23:14 - Jodi Grooteman: Okee|0
29-09-17 11:13 - Luke: Someone who wants to meet before the group meeting today ?|1
29-09-17 11:13 - Hannes: what do you want to discuss before the meeting?|1
29-09-17 11:14 - Luke: Well dont really know But I have class untill 14:00 and than I have nothing untill the meeting|1
29-09-17 11:15 - Luke: So if someone is also early I can meet|1
29-09-17 11:45 - Hannes: im sorry i cant|1
29-09-17 11:51 - Joost: I have some other things to do till 16.30|1
29-09-17 13:27 - Natalia: Guys, I'm not feeling well today, so I won't be able to come to the meeting. Please let me know after the meeting what you decide on the parts ordering issue :)|1
29-09-17 13:28 - Hannes: well can we say something with nienke present about that issue?|1
29-09-17 13:29 - Natalia: I personally think it's not a good idea to tell her|1
29-09-17 13:31 - Luke: I Agree with that|1
29-09-17 13:31 - Luke: I spoke with another group today and they all say that that probally will be above limit|1
29-09-17 14:13 - Jodi Grooteman: Beterschap Natalia!|1
29-09-17 14:13 - Jodi Grooteman: Like get well soon i think? 🤔|1
29-09-17 14:19 - Natalia: Yes I think that's it haha! dank je wel Jodi 😊|1
29-09-17 14:21 - Hannes: Get well soon!|1
29-09-17 14:22 - Roos: Get well soon Natalia!!|1
29-09-17 14:24 - Joost: Get well!|1
29-09-17 14:25 - Natalia: Thank you guys!! :)|1
29-09-17 16:42 - Hannes: Which room was it i forgot|1
29-09-17 18:28 - Natalia: Have you decided something, guys?|1
29-09-17 18:52 - Joost: We ve decided that you can order all parts. Furthermore we decided that we should do as much as possible work before the parts arrive.
You can find the details in the minutes this evening.


I have sent an email 1 minute ago for the frame. So I hope we'll receive the parts next week. Hannes has sent his email already for the Mantis Claw. Those parts will probably and hopefully be ready by Wednesday next week.|1
29-09-17 18:57 - Natalia: Okay, that's great, thanks for the information :)|1
01-10-17 15:04 - Joost: I want to know your opinion about making the landing mechanism out of StyroFoam. If we can make pillars with widths of 2cm by 2cm (which is pretty stable i think) and we attach four of those pillars to the drone, then the landing mechanism will weigh around 20 gram. If we use wood it will be around 150-200 gram. I want to know what you think of making the landing mechanism with Styrofoam (piepschuim)?|1
01-10-17 15:13 - Luke: Doesnt sturofoam break to easily?|1
01-10-17 15:17 - Joost: Pillars of 2 by 2 cm dont break very easy. However if the drone crashes at a high speed it probably will break (I think the damage to the motors, arduino etc, will not be more due to this). So we should choose between:
180 grams and a landing mechanism which will never break
16 grams and a landing mechanism that will break if the drone crashes, however it will be very easy to replace|1
01-10-17 15:19 - Joost: Can you all give your opinion so that I can work on one of the ideas 🙂 ?|1
01-10-17 15:22 - Luke: I Agree with your plan|1
01-10-17 15:36 - Hannes: Well i agree with the weight but i dont think having a landing mechanism that is very fragile will help protecting something. Also how would you attach the styrofoam to an aluminum frame?|1
01-10-17 15:37 - Hannes: Shall we do it out of spyrofoam and if it fails we can always try something else?|1
01-10-17 15:44 - Roos: Yes, I think that’s a good idea|1
02-10-17 22:06 - Joost: We have a big problem concerning the frame. I just got this e-mail. Maybe it's best to discuss it tomorrow?|1
02-10-17 22:07 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
02-10-17 22:10 - Joost: It can maybe be solved by putting different parts together. However we then need to cut the parts ourselves into the original lengths.|1
02-10-17 22:10 - Hannes: Huh what|0
02-10-17 22:11 - Hannes: Ah oke that wasnt clear...|1
02-10-17 22:11 - Hannes: Wel can we drill the holes ourselves then?|1
02-10-17 22:14 - Hannes: We could just request 6 bars without holes and make them ourselves?|1
03-10-17 12:44 - Luke: I fixen it|1
03-10-17 12:44 - Luke: From tomorrow on I can get into the workshop|1
03-10-17 12:47 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
03-10-17 12:49 - Luke: Nice|0
03-10-17 12:49 - Hannes: Yeah looks really nice|1
03-10-17 12:52 - Hannes: I can look for the bolts and nuts this afternoon and i can assemble it tomorrow morning|1
03-10-17 12:53 - Luke: Without sanding?|1
03-10-17 12:54 - Hannes: Oh yeah|1
03-10-17 12:54 - Hannes: When could you sand it down|1
03-10-17 12:54 - Hannes: I can also do it thursday in the morning|1
03-10-17 12:55 - Hannes: If you want to sand it down before you still need the key|1
03-10-17 12:55 - Hannes: Where are you now matbe i can still catch you at the stationp|1
03-10-17 12:55 - Luke: Well I can do it thursday Morning if it is before 10:30|1
03-10-17 12:55 - Luke: Because than I have another meeting|1
03-10-17 12:55 - Luke: No I am already at work|1
03-10-17 12:56 - Hannes: Ah too bad|1
03-10-17 12:56 - Hannes: Meet yhursday then?|1
03-10-17 12:56 - Luke: Okeay|1
03-10-17 13:02 - Roos: Nice!! I just saw that we have a 7,0 for the presentation 😊|1
03-10-17 13:03 - Luke: Seriously !?|1
03-10-17 13:03 - Luke: Nice !!! 🤘🏽|0
03-10-17 13:04 - Joost: That's nice 😁|0
03-10-17 13:04 - Roos: You can check it, it is on osiris|1
03-10-17 13:06 - Hannes: Nice!|0
03-10-17 13:07 - Natalia: Nice! What percentage of the final grade is it? :)|1
03-10-17 13:11 - Roos: Ten|1
03-10-17 13:16 - Natalia: Not bad at all 👍🏻👍🏻|0
03-10-17 13:34 - Natalia: Also, I haven't told updated you guys about it yet, but the total order cost was 94 euro.
Out of which the components cost 71.
So 24 euro extra, or 4 each.|1
03-10-17 13:34 - Luke: NIce that it is 71 now instead of 80 👍🏼|1
03-10-17 13:34 - Joost: Can you send your bank details where we can send it to?|1
03-10-17 13:36 - Natalia: NL42 INGB 0754 8386 17|1
03-10-17 13:37 - Natalia: N. Golova|1
03-10-17 13:37 - Natalia: Thanks :)|0
03-10-17 13:43 - Joost: I have transferred 4 euros to your bank account|1
03-10-17 13:46 - Natalia: Got it, thanks :)|0
03-10-17 14:42 - Jodi Grooteman: I have also transferred it|1
03-10-17 14:46 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
03-10-17 14:47 - Natalia: Thanks Jodi :)|0
03-10-17 14:47 - Hannes: someone left his/her bag with an ipad, it is now at the reception next to the room|1
03-10-17 14:47 - Natalia: Yep, that was me, already picked up :)|1
03-10-17 14:48 - Hannes: ah great|0
03-10-17 15:16 - Joost: What kind of connection should there be between the arduino and the camera? (I want to know how many wires will go from above the frame to underneath the frame where the camera is and the other way around)|1
03-10-17 15:45 - Natalia: Should be 7 wires going from above|1
04-10-17 11:08 - Natalia: Morning! I'd appreciate if everyone else transfers their share of the costs as well.|1
04-10-17 11:20 - Hannes: Oh yeah will do it in a sec|1
04-10-17 11:26 - Hannes: done|0
04-10-17 11:34 - Luke: Done ✌🏼|0
04-10-17 11:53 - Natalia: Thanks!|0
04-10-17 16:43 - Joost: The personal grades till now are also on osiris.tue.nl|1
04-10-17 16:52 - Luke: What did you receive ?|1
04-10-17 16:57 - Hannes: i had a 7,5|1
04-10-17 16:59 - Joost: Same|0
04-10-17 17:00 - Luke: I only had a 6,5 😥|0
04-10-17 17:17 - Joost: Maybe because you were  sick?|0
04-10-17 17:18 - Luke: Screw them 😒|0
04-10-17 21:27 - Jodi Grooteman: Shall i buy the things like balloons and rope or just think of where we can get it?|1
04-10-17 21:31 - Jodi Grooteman: I dont mind paying for it by the way (also when it is not good)|1
04-10-17 21:34 - Joost: Everyone check what they have at home and it will be for free 😁👍🏼|1
04-10-17 21:37 - Jodi Grooteman: Haha even better|0
04-10-17 21:38 - Jodi Grooteman: Does someone have nets/rope/tie-raps/silicone/balloons at home that we can use?|1
05-10-17 08:46 - Hannes: The aluminum parts are in the locker|1
05-10-17 09:03 - Joost: Well I didnot expect that|0
05-10-17 09:04 - Joost: But that is very good newa|1
05-10-17 11:38 - Roos: What is the difference between control and solution in the risk assessment? In my opinion, I am writing the same things down for both categories|1
05-10-17 11:39 - Hannes: control is the part what can be done to avoid the risk|1
05-10-17 11:39 - Hannes: solution is the solution of what we should do after it occurs|1
05-10-17 11:40 - Roos: Okay thanks!|1
05-10-17 12:23 - Roos: I do not know if we did the risk management the right way, this is what the report format tells about it: Give a maximum one page table for the risk management of the function solutions in your chosen Preliminary Design on the three dimensions (probability, impact, control).|1
05-10-17 12:24 - Roos: At this moment we have around 10 pages of all risks, including the risks of presenting and the closing event|1
05-10-17 13:37 - Jodi Grooteman: Ow|0
05-10-17 13:52 - Roos: Should we make an appendix of the table and make a shorter one in the report?|1
05-10-17 15:05 - Jodi Grooteman: Yeah or only put the table that you made in the report|1
05-10-17 15:06 - Jodi Grooteman: Because that is about the organizational things and that is what they want in it i guess|1
06-10-17 13:32 - Hannes: Hi everyone im now at gamma for buying the bolts and nuts only i have a problem. I need a M10x40 bolt plus nut. Unfortuntaly they only have them in a minimum quantity of 8. So that would be 4 euros for the pack. Should we delay that bolt and nut and check if anyone has that at home?|1
06-10-17 13:33 - Hannes: It is not needed as fast as possible but the m10 bolt is needed to connect the mantisclaw to the drone and also to keep the mantisclaw together.|1
06-10-17 13:35 - Hannes: I am buying the 20 M5x16 now and i will delay the bigger nut|1
06-10-17 13:35 - Hannes: Btw you can get free wood at gamma|1
06-10-17 15:54 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
06-10-17 15:59 - Jodi Grooteman: Nicee|0
06-10-17 16:03 - Joost: Yeah|0
06-10-17 16:03 - Natalia: Awesome, Hannes!|0
06-10-17 16:07 - Roos: Nice! ☺|0
06-10-17 20:38 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
06-10-17 20:52 - Natalia: 👍🏻👍🏻|0
06-10-17 20:54 - Joost: Looks very Nice! Good work|0
08-10-17 11:02 - Hannes: Hi all, is anyone home? Can someone look if they have a M10 bolt together with nut in their toolbox? The length should be around 40 mm. Can be longer but preferably not shorter|1
08-10-17 11:43 - Roos: Sorry, I just asked my dad but we only have m8 and m12 😅|1
08-10-17 11:49 - Hannes: Ahh too bad|0
08-10-17 12:48 - Luke: Ik not at home at the moment|1
08-10-17 16:47 - Joost: I'm also not at home till next friday|1
09-10-17 11:30 - Luke: How late are we going to meet tomorrow ?|1
09-10-17 12:08 - Luke: @31634647614  @31619244912  ?|1
09-10-17 12:10 - Hannes: Hopefully the new mantis parts are already in the locker|1
09-10-17 12:12 - Joost: I can meet till 17.00, however I was sick this weekend and I'm still not feeling that well so I want to begin after 10.00 if that is okay with you?|1
09-10-17 12:13 - Luke: I am not able to meet in the afternoon|1
09-10-17 12:14 - Luke: I have another course between 14:00 and 17:00|1
09-10-17 12:14 - Luke: So I am only able to meet untill 14:00|1
09-10-17 12:15 - Luke: 10:00 - 14:00 then ?|1
09-10-17 12:16 - Joost: That's fine by me 😀|1
09-10-17 12:46 - Jodi Grooteman: That is also fine by me 👍|1
10-10-17 08:53 - Jodi Grooteman: Where do we meet?|1
10-10-17 08:57 - Luke: Vertigo i think|1
10-10-17 08:58 - Luke: Im 10 minutes later probably|1
10-10-17 08:58 - Luke: i have some delay|0
10-10-17 08:59 - Luke: Perhaps one of you guys can get the stuff from the locker and take it to vertigo?|1
10-10-17 09:25 - Jodi Grooteman: I will do that because i also have the keys haha|1
10-10-17 09:35 - Luke: Okido|1
10-10-17 10:13 - Jodi Grooteman: The new mantis claw parts have arrived|1
10-10-17 09:54 - Joost: I'm at vertigo|1
10-10-17 09:55 - Luke: I am there around 10:10|1
10-10-17 10:06 - Luke: Im at vertigo|1
10-10-17 10:07 - Joost: I see you|1
10-10-17 10:07 - Luke: Where ?|1
10-10-17 10:07 - Joost: From above|1
10-10-17 11:32 - Joost: We can't make holes into the aluminium parts, because the holes will be too close to the edge and the construction will break. Therefore we tried soldering the aluminium with tin however the tin does not connect to the aluminium. Therefore soldering is also a problem.|1
10-10-17 11:44 - Hannes: Nice!|0
10-10-17 11:45 - Hannes: Uhm pff im not sure how you could connect.it then|1
10-10-17 13:05 - Luke: So the frame didnt work as we hoped it would. I am going to have a look at the frame at home. I will use a drill and screws to connect te parts.|1
10-10-17 13:06 - Luke: What I need to know is some minimal dimensions that the frame needs|1
10-10-17 13:07 - Luke: Like what are the minimal dimensions you need for the middle part of the frame (the place for the arduino ect) ?|1
10-10-17 13:08 - Luke: And for the distance between the motors I can just use the dimensions of the propellers?|1
10-10-17 13:16 - Hannes: The area was 12 by 12 cm. That was in mind when making the frame in nx|1
10-10-17 13:16 - Hannes: So make sure it is a bit more than that|1
10-10-17 13:16 - Hannes: Like 12.1 x 12.1|1
10-10-17 13:17 - Hannes: You can use the dimensions of the propeller|1
10-10-17 13:17 - Luke: But the battary is 14cm|1
10-10-17 13:17 - Hannes: Oh that was not mentioned to me when i designed the frame|1
10-10-17 13:17 - Natalia: The battery is 12cm|1
10-10-17 13:17 - Natalia: Not 14.|1
10-10-17 13:18 - Natalia: So 12x12 are correct dimensions|1
10-10-17 13:19 - Natalia: The absolute minimum would be 12x10 cm but I'd really prefer 12x12|1
10-10-17 13:23 - Luke: I will try to make that, only one problem. We already cutted the aluminium the way the first design was. I will look What is possible and inform you. Because I use screws we can always unscrew thing which only leaves a hole|1
10-10-17 13:23 - Luke: If this fails we probally will have to go for wood|1
10-10-17 13:24 - Hannes: ah oke|0
10-10-17 13:24 - Hannes: hope it will work|1
10-10-17 13:25 - Natalia: But the first design was made for 12x12, so should be all good, right?|1
10-10-17 13:25 - Luke: But I have a good feeling that it would work|1
10-10-17 13:25 - Luke: Well the problem with the first design is that you cant really make those connections using screws|1
10-10-17 13:26 - Luke: There where some flaws in the design but I will try to fix it this week|1
10-10-17 13:27 - Natalia: Okay that would be great, yes :)|1
10-10-17 13:27 - Hannes: okay nice :)|0
10-10-17 13:28 - Hannes: i can work tomorrow again, i have more time then i think|1
10-10-17 13:28 - Hannes: is there anything anyone knows>|1
10-10-17 13:28 - Hannes: otherwise im just going to add stuff to the report or improve some|1
10-10-17 13:29 - Luke: I cant meet. I will work on the frame at home|1
10-10-17 13:30 - Hannes: doesnt have to be a meeting|1
11-10-17 11:19 - Roos: It is kind of impossible to change the table of risk assessment till one page as we need as least 10 risks. In the rubrics, nothing is said about the solutions that we included in the table. Do you think I can remove that, because that might help in getting only one page?|1
11-10-17 11:50 - Hannes: There was not a solution colom needed?|1
11-10-17 11:50 - Hannes: Is it included in the course manual?|1
11-10-17 11:58 - Roos: Oh really, where? There is nothing about it in the report template and the report rubrics|1
11-10-17 12:14 - Hannes: the only part where i could find it was in A.3|1
11-10-17 12:14 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
11-10-17 12:14 - Hannes: at risk response planning|1
11-10-17 12:14 - Hannes: but it doesnt state that is has to be in the table|1
11-10-17 12:39 - Hannes: is the mantis-claw tested btw?|1
11-10-17 12:39 - Hannes: if not i can work on that tomorrow|1
11-10-17 13:33 - Hannes: Who has the key because i need that tomorrow for the mantis claw testing|1
11-10-17 13:33 - Hannes: Also where were the dolls that were the same in the final test?|1
11-10-17 13:33 - Hannes: Audi rifgt?|1
11-10-17 13:36 - Joost: I think jodi has the key and I don't know where the dolls are|1
11-10-17 13:39 - Jodi Grooteman: Yeah i have the key|1
12-10-17 09:22 - Hannes: Something went wrong with laserprinting|1
12-10-17 09:22 - Hannes: Oh no sorry|0
12-10-17 09:25 - Hannes: Well it was not cut fully through|1
12-10-17 09:26 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:27 - Hannes: Therefore the parts were too tightly connected so i wont be able to detach the claws without cracks or somethig|1
12-10-17 09:31 - Luke: Hmm thats weird|1
12-10-17 09:31 - Luke: Question, the diameter of the props is 25cm right ?|1
12-10-17 09:32 - Hannes: Yeah somethig like thar|0
12-10-17 09:32 - Hannes: 10 inches|1
12-10-17 09:32 - Luke: That really is a problem|1
12-10-17 09:32 - Hannes: So a tiny bit more|1
12-10-17 09:32 - Luke: Because the arms of the drone are just 14cm|1
12-10-17 09:33 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:33 - Luke: So if I connect them to the outer end you Only have like 13cm left between the motor and the frame|1
12-10-17 09:33 - Joost: Thats close|1
12-10-17 09:33 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:34 - Luke: While the idea actually was to connect them more into the middel and make an extra connectiin to another frame|1
12-10-17 09:34 - Luke: That would Only give is around 10cm between the motor and frame|1
12-10-17 09:34 - Luke: :p|0
12-10-17 09:37 - Hannes: You can make an outer frame instead of an extra inner frame|1
12-10-17 09:37 - Hannes: As i did in nx|1
12-10-17 09:37 - Luke: Where did you do that ?|1
12-10-17 09:38 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:38 - Luke: Because this was my idea|1
12-10-17 09:38 - Luke: But I dont understand why we made the arms so short if the props are so big|1
12-10-17 09:39 - Natalia: The props are 9.4 inches|1
12-10-17 09:39 - Luke: And in cm ?|1
12-10-17 09:39 - Joost: 23.876cm|1
12-10-17 09:39 - Luke: Thats like 24|0
12-10-17 09:39 - Luke: Hahahaha on with did you guys base the frame then|1
12-10-17 09:40 - Luke: Because than 14cm would be really short|1
12-10-17 09:40 - Luke: We should have made it like 18cm or something|1
12-10-17 09:40 - Joost: We didn't have that amount of aluminum|1
12-10-17 09:41 - Luke: Well we my new idea we would have had enough|1
12-10-17 09:41 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:41 - Luke: This is my idea for the frame|1
12-10-17 09:41 - Luke: The square would be 16x16cm so big enough for all the stuf|1
12-10-17 09:42 - Luke: Than I connect the arms using a L profile as you can see|1
12-10-17 09:42 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:43 - Luke: And for the corners I would use these conners to connect the and make them stable|1
12-10-17 09:43 - Joost: We had a similar kind of frame, the problem is we thought the arms would be unstable, however your idea is very smart and works way better|1
12-10-17 09:43 - Luke: Okeay I have an idea|1
12-10-17 09:43 - Luke: I make it like this and show it to you guys tomorrow|1
12-10-17 09:44 - Luke: I Just was at the “Gamma” to get some screws and I saw the exact same U profile as we have|1
12-10-17 09:44 - Luke: So after tonorrow I can buy that and change the arms for lingerie arms|1
12-10-17 09:44 - Luke: Longer|1
12-10-17 09:44 - Luke: Lingerie 😂😂|0
12-10-17 09:44 - Hannes: We had similar frame but we made room for the lenght of the amrs by making an extra outer frame jnstead of inner frame|1
12-10-17 09:45 - Luke: I didnt see that Outer frame on the scetch Hannes, Because we used the scarch to build this|1
12-10-17 09:45 - Hannes: So the area remained 12 by 12 and xould go up|1
12-10-17 09:45 - Hannes: Well sorry but no i will send a foto|1
12-10-17 09:45 - Luke: But what do you think about my idea|1
12-10-17 09:46 - Hannes: Well do we have an area now where we coyld build?|1
12-10-17 09:46 - Luke: I think it wil definetly work and je need less aluminium compared to an Outer frame so less weight|1
12-10-17 09:46 - Hannes: In the middle|1
12-10-17 09:46 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:46 - Luke: Yeah the middle are is 16x16 so even Bigger|1
12-10-17 09:46 - Luke: That bar in the middle sould be underneath to connect the camera and maris claw|1
12-10-17 09:47 - Hannes: Ah oke nice but the part where there are not aluminum staves|1
12-10-17 09:47 - Luke: How do you mean ?|1
12-10-17 09:47 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:47 - Hannes: i made it like this|1
12-10-17 09:48 - Hannes: the inner area is not blocked by any stave and i made an outer frame to make sure the arms couldnt move freely|1
12-10-17 09:48 - Luke: Well that is almost the same if you see my frame as the outer frame|1
12-10-17 09:49 - Hannes: well yeah but the arms dont have the certain length now|1
12-10-17 09:49 - Luke: Because your Outer frame is also 16x16 like mine|1
12-10-17 09:49 - Hannes: since they are reaching the area of the arduino etc|1
12-10-17 09:49 - Luke: It are the same arms as af your frame|1
12-10-17 09:50 - Luke: Because the profiles I have right now are based on you frame|1
12-10-17 09:50 - Hannes: no it is not since the distance between the end of the arm and the beginning of the area for the arduino is shorter in your case|1
12-10-17 09:50 - Hannes: therefore the propeller might hit that area|1
12-10-17 09:50 - Luke: It isnt :p|0
12-10-17 09:50 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:50 - Luke: Both arms in your draaiing and nu profile are 14cm|1
12-10-17 09:50 - Hannes: you have some length of the arm inside the area|1
12-10-17 09:51 - Luke: You also have that if you see your Outer frame as the area|1
12-10-17 09:51 - Luke: Which is the same frame as i have|1
12-10-17 09:51 - Hannes: ohh wait the parts of your area are the same as mine of the outer frame?|1
12-10-17 09:52 - Hannes: are those the 16 cm?|1
12-10-17 09:52 - Luke: Yes|1
12-10-17 09:52 - Hannes: ah im very sorry|1
12-10-17 09:52 - Hannes: i thought they were the same length as the inner frame of mine|1
12-10-17 09:52 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:52 - Luke: So the green area is the same as you inner area|1
12-10-17 09:52 - Hannes: no you are right my mistake|1
12-10-17 09:53 - Hannes: ill go back at testing now 😂|1
12-10-17 09:53 - Luke: But I think that 14cm than still is very close to the electronics|1
12-10-17 09:53 - Hannes: but to be sure does anyone knows where the dolls are?|1
12-10-17 09:53 - Luke: But as I say, I can make it with 14cm, we can have a look and if is doenst work I can easily get Bigger ones|1
12-10-17 09:53 - Natalia: So the u shape of the arms is gonna be u top or u bottom?|1
12-10-17 09:54 - Natalia: Cause we need to think about how to place the motors there too|1
12-10-17 09:54 - Hannes: you can get bigger ones?|1
12-10-17 09:54 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:54 - Luke: Like thise|1
12-10-17 09:54 - Luke: Upside down wont work with connecting it to the frame|1
12-10-17 09:55 - Luke: Yeah is Just was at Gamma and the if the exact same u profile|1
12-10-17 09:55 - Natalia: Ok but how do we place the motor on top of that u?|1
12-10-17 09:55 - Natalia: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 09:55 - Luke: That I didnt look into|1
12-10-17 09:55 - Natalia: Here are the motor dimensions|1
12-10-17 09:56 - Natalia: Maybe will be helpful?|1
12-10-17 09:56 - Luke: This was the same idea of the arms as in the frame of Hannes and Joost|1
12-10-17 09:56 - Luke: We will have to look into that tomorrow|1
12-10-17 09:56 - Luke: I thought it was someones hwa?|1
12-10-17 09:57 - Natalia: I don't know, I thought it was s part of the frame making hwa|1
12-10-17 09:57 - Luke: Nope|0
12-10-17 09:57 - Luke: There was a separate hwa of How to connect everything to the frame|1
12-10-17 09:58 - Luke: But do I have a GO on making this frame Because I Only have 2 hours left|1
12-10-17 09:58 - Natalia: Maybe but the frame should be made with motors in mind, right? :)|1
12-10-17 09:58 - Luke: And I really need alot of time|1
12-10-17 09:59 - Luke: Well I didnt make the first frame, I Just adjusted it and the arms are still the same|1
12-10-17 10:00 - Joost: I did previous HWA how to connect everything, therefore i mentioned at the meeting that I did not know how to connect the motors.|1
12-10-17 10:00 - Luke: Yeah and then we said someone had to look into that|1
12-10-17 10:01 - Natalia: It's all great, I'm just saying this is one important thing to take into account while designing it|1
12-10-17 10:01 - Luke: Yeah we can always detach the arms and make something new|1
12-10-17 10:02 - Luke: Its Just connecties using screws so we can always change it a little bit|1
12-10-17 10:02 - Luke: Connected|1
12-10-17 10:03 - Natalia: Oh wait I remember someone said during the last meeting, we could turn the arms on the side, so we can connect the motors|1
12-10-17 10:04 - Natalia: Anyway, I guess we can check it tomorrow|1
12-10-17 10:04 - Natalia: I've received 2 motors so far|1
12-10-17 10:04 - Luke: On the side would be really unstable I think|1
12-10-17 10:04 - Natalia: So we can already check :)|1
12-10-17 10:04 - Joost: nice|1
12-10-17 10:04 - Luke: But we can check|1
12-10-17 10:04 - Luke: Tomorrow|1
12-10-17 10:13 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 10:13 - Luke: Hahaha Holy shit it works|1
12-10-17 10:14 - Luke: I have like this multi tool and it can easily cut trew the aluminium|1
12-10-17 10:14 - Hannes: I asked arround for the dolls since i could not find where to test it. It is neither in the course manual nor the discussion nor emails. Some friends said that it could be done in the last two weeks of the projext|1
12-10-17 10:14 - Hannes: So i think we will get an email soon of the details|1
12-10-17 10:14 - Hannes: I will send one myself|1
12-10-17 10:15 - Hannes: And as a hwa i will inprove the test plan of the mantis claw to include multiple claws, tables and make sure that everythibg can be tested asap|1
12-10-17 10:16 - Luke: Did you already think about making the claw more humane?|1
12-10-17 10:16 - Luke: Because that also has to be done this week|1
12-10-17 10:16 - Hannes: That was in previous hwa's right|1
12-10-17 10:17 - Hannes: I can include that in the testing plan|1
12-10-17 10:19 - Jodi Grooteman: Ow I wanted to do that as hwa because I have also no hwa anymore|1
12-10-17 10:19 - Jodi Grooteman: Is there something else I can do?|1
12-10-17 10:20 - Hannes: Ah oke uhm if you prefer to do it than you can but i dont have that much time today|1
12-10-17 10:21 - Jodi Grooteman: You mean the test plan?|1
12-10-17 10:21 - Hannes: Yess|1
12-10-17 10:22 - Hannes: Or i can make the trst plan|1
12-10-17 10:22 - Hannes: And you thw humane part|1
12-10-17 10:23 - Jodi Grooteman: Roos already made the humane part right?|1
12-10-17 10:23 - Jodi Grooteman: Or making a test plan for of?|1
12-10-17 10:24 - Jodi Grooteman: Because I have that already in the test plan of the mantis claw|1
12-10-17 10:25 - Hannes: ah oke|0
12-10-17 10:26 - Hannes: have you already done like tables with multiple claws?|1
12-10-17 10:26 - Hannes: if you have done that i will just spend some time adding stuff to the report and improving some|1
12-10-17 10:28 - Jodi Grooteman: No there are no tables yet|1
12-10-17 10:28 - Hannes: ah oke should i make them and and some stuff to the report than?|1
12-10-17 10:29 - Jodi Grooteman: Yeah sure|1
12-10-17 10:29 - Jodi Grooteman: But I dont have a hwa then haha|1
12-10-17 10:29 - Hannes: oh than i will see which claw closes perfectly and add some stuff to the report haha|1
12-10-17 10:29 - Hannes: do you the table?|1
12-10-17 10:30 - Hannes: and maybe work for the report aswell?|1
12-10-17 10:30 - Jodi Grooteman: Okayy|0
12-10-17 10:30 - Jodi Grooteman: Thanks!|0
12-10-17 10:30 - Jodi Grooteman: 😊|0

12-10-17 11:44 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 11:45 - Luke: Im not going to get the frame finished today|1
12-10-17 11:53 - Luke: I really mis like an extra hand to do this|1
12-10-17 11:56 - Hannes: well i am not available today or tomorrow|1
12-10-17 11:56 - Hannes: on monday i can help|1
12-10-17 12:01 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 12:02 - Luke: This is What I have so far|1
12-10-17 12:11 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
12-10-17 12:11 - Luke: And this will be the next step|1
12-10-17 12:12 - Hannes: looks great|0
12-10-17 12:13 - Luke: It is definetly not perfect, some cornes arnt 100% straight Because it is very hard to do by hand|1
12-10-17 12:13 - Luke: But we can try this and if it needs improvement i will by new U-profiles and start over|1
12-10-17 12:13 - Luke: Buy|1
12-10-17 12:13 - Hannes: yeah that is always a problem with hardware|1
12-10-17 12:14 - Hannes: still it looks nice!|1
12-10-17 12:14 - Luke: Thanks|1
12-10-17 19:02 - Joost: Are we going to meet tomorrow before the actual meeting?||1
13-10-17 10:19 - Roos: I do not know, but I am not in Eindhoven at the moment, so it would be nice to know some time in advance 🙈|1
13-10-17 10:20 - Luke: I dont have that much time|1
13-10-17 10:21 - Luke: I could meet like 30-45 minutes before the meeting ?|1
13-10-17 11:56 - Luke: We dont have a meeting on friday 20okt right ?|1
13-10-17 11:59 - Joost: After today we dont have any meeting on friday|1
13-10-17 12:00 - Luke: Okeay Because friday 20oct there is a big design event within the ddw and I would really like to go there if you guys agree|1
13-10-17 12:01 - Luke: That starts at 12:00 in Eindhoven so if you guys do wanna meet that they I could meet untill 11:00|1
13-10-17 14:43 - Luke: Im already at paviljoen so if someone wants to meet I am at the kantine 👍🏼|1
13-10-17 15:38 - Natalia: Guys, I think I'm supposed to be the secretary today, but I won't be able to.. Spent the day at the hospital with an eye emergency and basically right now I can hardly see anything, so can someone elsee please replace me? I'll come but I'll be a bit blind|1
13-10-17 15:38 - Hannes: i cant beforehand|1
13-10-17 15:38 - Hannes: i can do the minutes|1
13-10-17 15:39 - Natalia: Thank you!|1
13-10-17 15:44 - Hannes: how is your eye right now?|1
13-10-17 15:44 - Hannes: shouldnt you stay home if you spent the day at the hospital? 😳|1
13-10-17 15:44 - Hannes: hope you will get well soon!|0
13-10-17 15:52 - Natalia: Not great :(|0
13-10-17 15:52 - Natalia: I want to stay home but it would be my 3 missed meeting..|1
13-10-17 15:52 - Natalia: So I'm on the train|1
13-10-17 15:52 - Natalia: Thank you|0
15-10-17 11:02 - Joost: Do we already have a test plan of the non Mantis Claw stuff?|1
15-10-17 11:02 - Hannes: luke made that|1
15-10-17 11:02 - Joost: HWA 8 right?|1
15-10-17 11:02 - Luke: No I made it for the drone|1
15-10-17 11:02 - Luke: Jodi made it for the claw|1
15-10-17 11:02 - Hannes: something like that|1
15-10-17 11:03 - Hannes: yeah i meant the non mantis claw|1
15-10-17 11:03 - Luke: Oow Yeah non mantis I did|1
15-10-17 11:03 - Hannes: so i meant the drone part|1
15-10-17 11:03 - Luke: Wilhich is the drone|1
15-10-17 11:06 - Joost: I see that we have a test plan for:
- Mantis Claw
- Working drone


I think I can add a test plan of all parts that will be or already are tested. For example checking if the camera functions, checking if the propellors work, etc. So I mean checking if all parts function.|1
15-10-17 11:08 - Luke: I dont think you need a test plan for that|1
15-10-17 11:09 - Hannes: what kind of test plan do you want with that?|1
15-10-17 11:09 - Hannes: do you want to make a table of 20 times if the camera works or not?|1
15-10-17 11:14 - Joost: We have to add a fit test in the report. This consist of (Course Manual):
-proof that it can be build (size and budget)
- emperical proof that things work
- parts can interact in the right way
- and we need to test with the breadboard the functionality


So Luke and Jodi worked on the third point, Natalia worked on the first point, Natalia performed the second point but I think we need some text on that part. And we need to do test with the breadboard, which also needs a test plan/material and method.|1
15-10-17 11:17 - Joost: So I mean just simple text about if all parts function|1
15-10-17 11:19 - Joost: I will start working on the breadboard part, is that okay with you?|1
15-10-17 11:19 - Hannes: oh yeah i had to ask something on breadboard and electrical circuit|1
15-10-17 11:34 - Hannes: yeah a friend told me that you need a capacitor to the servo so you would have better wi-fi. otherwise the magnetic fiels would disrupt it. However it is not necessary if the servo has intern decoupling. Apparently 47 mF is enough|1
15-10-17 11:37 - Joost: I do not have any knowledge of a breadboard, but we need a test plan for the breadboard part. So is there anyone who knows anything about these things?|1
15-10-17 11:37 - Luke: A breadboard is nothing else than Just a simple way to connect the parts|1
15-10-17 11:37 - Luke: I know what it is|1
15-10-17 11:38 - Luke: I can look in to that this week But not before tomorrow|1
15-10-17 11:39 - Hannes: same|1
15-10-17 11:40 - Hannes: i dont have any experience in electronics though|1
15-10-17 11:40 - Luke: I have a little bit|1
15-10-17 11:41 - Luke: We just have to test the scemetic that Natalie made|1
15-10-17 11:41 - Luke: Test if every thing works|1
15-10-17 11:41 - Luke: And meausure the values|1
15-10-17 11:41 - Luke: For this you can use a breadboard|1
16-10-17 10:44 - Luke: Guys and girls I am not going to be able to finish the frame|1
16-10-17 10:45 - Luke: Again there are some troubles which make it not work|1
16-10-17 10:45 - Luke: I have several ideas of how I might be able to fix it but for this is have to see the gear and watch if things fit and How they could be connected|1
16-10-17 10:46 - Luke: And then I have to look what I need and how I can make it|1
16-10-17 12:28 - Jodi Grooteman: <Media weggelaten>|1
16-10-17 12:28 - Jodi Grooteman: We can do two pages now but i think its okay as it is|1
16-10-17 15:38 - Luke: Someone wants to meet before the meeting tonorrow ?|1
16-10-17 15:39 - Joost: Ofcourse, maybe with everyone is better|1
16-10-17 15:39 - Luke: I can only meet before the meeting because after the meeting I have another meeting|1
16-10-17 17:27 - Roos: Yes, I could only meet before the official meeting|1
16-10-17 17:35 - Hannes: i can meet after the meeting for a lot of hours but not long before the meeting|1
16-10-17 17:52 - Joost: I can meet the whole day till 17.00|1
16-10-17 17:58 - Luke: Well maybe you guys could meet and start working on it after the general meeting|1
16-10-17 17:58 - Luke: I cant tomorow but I can work on it other days this week|1
16-10-17 19:02 - Natalia: I can only meet about half an hour before the official meeting and not after, other days would be better for me|1
16-10-17 19:03 - Natalia: Also uploaded a list of things to read/watch on connecting the parts as promised|1
16-10-17 19:03 - Natalia: To the main folder|1
16-10-17 19:04 - Jodi Grooteman: I can after the meeting|1
16-10-17 19:05 - Natalia: Does anyone have a soldering iron?|1
16-10-17 19:06 - Luke: I have some|1
16-10-17 19:06 - Luke: But you can get it for free at the tue when you solder over there|1
16-10-17 19:07 - Natalia: Cause there's this one pretty tedious job that needs to be done with soldering, which would be useful to do it tomorrow|1
16-10-17 19:08 - Natalia: Maybe by several people, whoever has time after the meeting?|1
16-10-17 19:08 - Luke: It can be done at the tue (Flux building)|1
16-10-17 19:08 - Luke: I dont have time after sadly only before|1
16-10-17 19:09 - Natalia: We need to solder connectors on the ends of the motor wires and on the ends of the esc wires|1
16-10-17 19:09 - Natalia: So if anyone is up for it, let me know :))|1
16-10-17 19:09 - Hannes: I have time|1
16-10-17 19:09 - Hannes: I dont have any experienxe though|1
16-10-17 19:10 - Natalia: I'm gonna try to do some at home and then I can explain tomorrow|1
16-10-17 19:14 - Natalia: Also, anyone has a kitchen lighter?|1
16-10-17 19:23 - Hannes: Yeah sure|1
16-10-17 19:23 - Hannes: I dont have a lighter|1
16-10-17 19:27 - Natalia: A normal lighter?|1
16-10-17 19:28 - Natalia: We need some sort of a lighter for that soldering job|1
16-10-17 19:28 - Luke: Why?|0
16-10-17 19:28 - Luke: What do you need it for ?|1
16-10-17 19:30 - Natalia: After you solder the connectors on, you cover it with heat shrink material to isolate the connections|1
16-10-17 19:30 - Natalia: So you need a lighter to shrink the heat shrink :)|1
16-10-17 19:30 - Luke: Aaah oké|0
16-10-17 19:30 - Luke: I understand ✌🏼|1
16-10-17 21:24 - Joost: Hannes and Luke can you upload your HWA?|1
16-10-17 21:25 - Hannes: Mine is the same as jodi|1
16-10-17 21:25 - Joost: Okay|0
16-10-17 21:45 - Joost: So are we doing a meeting before 11.45?|1
16-10-17 21:47 - Hannes: I cant im sorry|1
16-10-17 23:07 - Natalia: So no lighter and no one interested in doing soldering tomorrow except for Hannes?|1
16-10-17 23:08 - Joost: I do not have a lighter. I can help with soldering!|1
16-10-17 23:19 - Natalia: Okay, great :) but we really need to get a lighter somewhere :D|1
16-10-17 23:26 - Luke: I can buy a sigaret lighter on the way to class|1
16-10-17 23:26 - Luke: Thats like 1 euro|1
16-10-17 23:26 - Luke: I will get one 😉👍🏼|1

17-10-17 13:53 - Roos: I talked to Nienke and we think it is a good idea to put all materiaal into the locker and give the key to someone who lives in eindhoven, but we do not know what you decided about this?|1
17-10-17 14:59 - Natalia: That's more or less what we did! Most of the parts will be in the locker|1
17-10-17 14:59 - Natalia: That's great you're available on Thursday! We've decided we are going to try to assemble the drone on that day|1
17-10-17 15:00 - Natalia: Start testing on Friday|1
17-10-17 15:41 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1

17-10-17 16:00 - Joost: So we also checked if we could put a current through the wires with some help of Electrical Engineering students 👌🏼
However some of the endings fall off.|1
17-10-17 16:08 - Natalia: What endings? You mean you didn't solder them well enough?|1
17-10-17 16:09 - Joost: We solder them right. And they are now connected to each other. We pulled on the endings to make sure they were connected strongly enough. However it happened 2 or 3 times that out of nowhere the thing fell of 🙁. So principally they shouldnt, but we dont know for sure.|1
17-10-17 16:10 - Natalia: Now that's really worrying.. hello cheap ESCs :(|1
17-10-17 20:25 - Jodi Grooteman: How late are we going to meet tomorrow?|1

17-10-17 20:32 - Natalia: What's best for you?|1
17-10-17 22:06 - Natalia: Guys?|1

18-10-17 11:17 - Joost: I don't know the right thickness and the length needed|1
18-10-17 11:17 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
18-10-17 11:17 - Joost: 16mm has to be long enough, however the thickness can be a problem|1
18-10-17 11:18 - Jodi Grooteman: The lengt is good i think|1
18-10-17 11:18 - Jodi Grooteman: Luke said about 15mm right?|1
18-10-17 11:19 - Joost: Yeah we need at least 12mm otherwise it wouldn't stick out of the frame. So 15mm is good for connecting it|1
18-10-17 11:19 - Jodi Grooteman: The thinkness also looks the same 🤷|1
18-10-17 11:19 - Joost: Yeah I think so too|1
18-10-17 11:19 - Joost: I have also an option for 20mm|1
18-10-17 11:19 - Jodi Grooteman: Hannes is back and id is m3 so good|1
18-10-17 11:19 - Jodi Grooteman: It*|0
18-10-17 11:20 - Joost: But can you measure if 20mm is much better than 16mm|1
18-10-17 11:21 - Joost: The price is the same|1
18-10-17 11:21 - Joost: I don't know if it is a problem if it will be sticking out more|1
18-10-17 12:02 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1

18-10-17 16:11 - Joost: Because I don't have much time. I'm free at 18.00 so I don't know if there are any shops still open|1
18-10-17 16:35 - Natalia: I think at gamma for sure|1
18-10-17 16:36 - Natalia: I'm not sure about like hema etc maybe they only have the thin flimsy type, but we need something strong|1
18-10-17 16:52 - Joost: I don't think gamma is open till 18.00, right?|1

18-10-17 16:56 - Joost: And I have lots of stuff with me (aluminium things) so it is not very practical for me to go there|1
18-10-17 17:05 - Joost: Can anyone pick it up tomorrow morning?|1
18-10-17 18:02 - Roos: Did you divide some hwa’s last tuesday or just building the drone together?|1

19-10-17 13:45 - Natalia: Assholes. Really had to make all the fuss about it|1
19-10-17 13:46 - Natalia: He basically said that it's because we're making such an incredible thing as the drone :D|1
19-10-17 13:46 - Hannes: haha|0
19-10-17 13:46 - Natalia: So|0
19-10-17 13:46 - Natalia: Now I'm thinking I need the electronic stuff again|1
19-10-17 13:46 - Natalia: Hannes are you around?|1
19-10-17 13:46 - Natalia: Cause I need the key|1
19-10-17 13:46 - Hannes: roos has the key|1
19-10-17 13:46 - Natalia: Oh yes|1
19-10-17 13:47 - Natalia: Hm|0
19-10-17 13:48 - Roos: Nice to hear Natalia!!!|0
19-10-17 13:48 - Natalia: Thank you!|0
19-10-17 14:11 - Luke: Yes!!!!|0
19-10-17 14:11 - Luke: Nice team work|0
19-10-17 14:34 - Joost: Yeah I'm very happy we turned this unfair decision around 💪🏼|1
19-10-17 16:17 - Luke: Now 100% on project again because now we really have to show them that we are worth it 🤘🏽🙌🏽|1
19-10-17 20:25 - Jodi Grooteman: How late are we going to meet tomorrow?|1
19-10-17 20:26 - Luke: I can meet from around 13:00 untill 17:00|1
19-10-17 20:27 - Luke: But I think we really have to meet as much as possible now|1
19-10-17 20:27 - Luke: Because due to that stupid unfair problem we already had a delay today in the planning and still have to do all the electronics before Natalie can start programming|1
19-10-17 20:28 - Luke: So enough to do 😄|1
19-10-17 20:29 - Natalia: I can come at around 12, or if everyone is coming at 13, then I guess 13 :)|1
19-10-17 20:30 - Luke: I can join around 13 but I hope others are able to start earlier|1
19-10-17 20:30 - Luke: I think at least the entire drone with electronics ect should be finish tomorrow so that we can start programming|1
19-10-17 20:30 - Natalia: What would be nice to do tomorrow (besides the electronics):
- attach the motors properly;
- balance the props;
- attach the landing system.
That's the minimum|1
19-10-17 20:31 - Luke: And making the report perfect|1
19-10-17 20:31 - Luke: Props are balanced|1
19-10-17 20:31 - Natalia: How did you do it?|1
19-10-17 20:31 - Jodi Grooteman: <Media weggelaten>|1
19-10-17 20:32 - Jodi Grooteman: Like this haha|1
19-10-17 20:32 - Luke: I didnt Joost and Hannes or Jodi did I think|1
19-10-17 20:33 - Joost: I am not coming tomorrow, because I have to travel 5 hours at least for 3 hours maximum work. It's a waste and I have joined the meetings on the previous meetings already👌🏼|1
19-10-17 20:34 - Natalia: Hm okay, I hope that works well enough :D|1
19-10-17 20:34 - Luke: The drone is never going to be perfect balanced|1
19-10-17 20:35 - Luke: Because the frame also is not in balance|1
19-10-17 20:35 - Natalia: That's great news (not) :D|1
19-10-17 20:35 - Natalia: Cause it should be as much as possible|1
19-10-17 20:35 - Jodi Grooteman: We looked pretty precisely|1
19-10-17 20:35 - Hannes: We looked at the propellers not the frame|1
19-10-17 20:35 - Jodi Grooteman: So the propellers are good i think|1
19-10-17 20:36 - Hannes: I can be there at 12/13|1
19-10-17 20:36 - Luke: We tried as much as possible But that Just aint possible if you make a frame by hand from aluminium|1
19-10-17 20:37 - Natalia: Yeah I understand, well I hope it's not perfect but good enough :)|1
19-10-17 20:37 - Luke: I hope the same|1
19-10-17 20:37 - Natalia: Also all the electronics should be centered|1
19-10-17 20:38 - Natalia: That's why tomorrow we might need to make like a second "floor" on top of the styrofoam|1
19-10-17 20:38 - Natalia: To separate some parts of the electronics from others|1
19-10-17 20:39 - Luke: Yeah I know|1
19-10-17 20:39 - Luke: So that is also going to take some time|1
19-10-17 20:39 - Luke: And I really think all of that should be finish tomorow|1
19-10-17 20:40 - Natalia: And make a safe attachment for the battery|1
19-10-17 20:40 - Natalia: Yes, there's plenty to do|1
19-10-17 20:54 - Roos: I could come before 12/13, but I prefer not te be alone as I do not think that is a good idea for the drone 🙈|1
19-10-17 20:57 - Roos: I could do some things in the report in the morning maybe?|1
19-10-17 20:58 - Luke: That could be very helpfull roos|1
19-10-17 20:58 - Luke: Every effort is Good at the moment|1
19-10-17 20:58 - Luke: We should do as much as we can|1
19-10-17 21:42 - Natalia: I agree, that would be great, Roos 👍🏻|1
20-10-17 08:09 - Joost: If I can work on something this day (not at the university) please ask me and I will help 😁|1
20-10-17 09:45 - Roos: Does someone has a picture of the second laser printed plate?|1
20-10-17 09:49 - Joost: HWA 8 from Hannes has a picture where the wooden plate is, but furthermore I havent found any digital picture for the laserprinting|1
20-10-17 09:50 - Roos: Yes I found that one, but we printed two plates|1
20-10-17 09:52 - Joost: HWA 9 from Hannes has the digital version|1
20-10-17 10:48 - Hannes: I did not have a second picture i do have a dxf-file|1
20-10-17 10:58 - Roos: Yeah, I already put that one in the report 😊|1
20-10-17 11:59 - Luke: I am ready to meet|1
20-10-17 11:59 - Luke: Who wants to meet ?|1
20-10-17 11:59 - Natalia: I'm on the train, will arrive at 12:45 :)|1
20-10-17 12:00 - Luke: Okeay|0
20-10-17 12:00 - Luke: Someone else ?|1
20-10-17 12:00 - Luke: Meet at vertigo again ?|1
20-10-17 12:01 - Natalia: Sounds good|1
20-10-17 12:04 - Jodi Grooteman: I Will also try to be there at 13:00|1
20-10-17 12:08 - Hannes: Yes same for me prob around 13|1
20-10-17 12:08 - Hannes: Or a bit later but not that much|1
20-10-17 13:04 - Jodi Grooteman: Where are you?|1
20-10-17 12:46 - Luke: I am at vertigo|1
20-10-17 12:46 - Luke: Looking for a place|1
20-10-17 12:47 - Hannes: im there in 15-20 minutes|1
20-10-17 12:47 - Luke: Same place as yesterday|1
20-10-17 12:47 - Luke: 4th Floor to the right|1
20-10-17 15:58 - Jodi Grooteman: <Media weggelaten>|1
20-10-17 15:59 - Jodi Grooteman: Half round or the whole part?|1
20-10-17 16:02 - Hannes: the whole|1
20-10-17 16:02 - Hannes: I thought in another way|1
20-10-17 16:02 - Jodi Grooteman: Yes i was thinking that already|1
20-10-17 16:02 - Jodi Grooteman: Top|0
22-10-17 14:10 - Joost: Can someone give me an update on how far the drone has been updated and what still needs to be done?|1
22-10-17 14:11 - Hannes: Well we had a big issue, the soldering part what we did was done wrong|1
22-10-17 14:12 - Hannes: Instead of the wire going into the large cilinder it was meant to go to the small cilinder|1
22-10-17 14:12 - Hannes: So the other way arround|1
22-10-17 14:14 - Hannes: Now cut off these parts and natalia is testing which wire of the ac should be attached to which wire of the motor by connecting the wires with making a knot in them|1
22-10-17 14:14 - Hannes: Since you need to know for clockwise or anti-clockwise|1
22-10-17 14:14 - Hannes: And furthermore the framework is almost done|1
22-10-17 14:15 - Hannes: On monday we work on the report and on tuesday natalia is going to uni and she has the parts so the drone van be fully assembled|1
22-10-17 14:15 - Hannes: In the meeting we will probably devide the project group in 2 groups|1
22-10-17 14:15 - Hannes: One will focus on programming and the other on yhe report plus the closing event|1
22-10-17 14:16 - Hannes: Soo i think that is it|1
22-10-17 14:17 - Joost: Thanks for the  explanation :)|1
22-10-17 14:17 - Hannes: No problem|1
22-10-17 14:18 - Joost: So is it a good idea to meet before the actual meeting on Tuesday because the actual meeting will consist off the end evaluation?|1
22-10-17 14:19 - Hannes: Yeah but like a said the group will probably be devided into two groups|1
22-10-17 14:20 - Joost: I have some time on Monday if I leave early tomorrow. So can i work on fixing the soldering with someone?|1
22-10-17 14:21 - Hannes: Natalia has a soldering kit herself so she is doing that part|1
22-10-17 14:21 - Hannes: In amsterdam|1
22-10-17 14:21 - Hannes: So that is what i said of the parts being here on tuesday|1
22-10-17 14:21 - Luke: I only have tuesday Morning Because from 13:00 - 17:00 I have another project|1
22-10-17 21:01 - Natalia: <Media weggelaten>|1
22-10-17 21:02 - Luke: Is that Good or bad ?|1
22-10-17 21:02 - Natalia: Update: having a lot of "fun" with these stupid motors that can't even decide which way they want to go themselves|1
22-10-17 21:02 - Jodi Grooteman: Oww|0
22-10-17 21:02 - Natalia: That's like really bad and I'm now trying to find a way to solve it but doesn't look very promising|1
22-10-17 21:03 - Luke: Doesnt that have anything to do with the screws?|1
22-10-17 21:03 - Luke: Maybe they block the megnatig field or something|1
22-10-17 21:03 - Natalia: Could be, but I checked and they don't seem to be touching the coils|1
22-10-17 21:04 - Luke: No but maybe Just Because they are there|1
22-10-17 21:04 - Luke: You could try without them|1
22-10-17 21:05 - Natalia: No, this has nothing to do with the magnetic field, something about the connection but I don't exactly what yet|1
22-10-17 21:08 - Hannes: I can look tomorrow online if i can find something about it|1
22-10-17 21:08 - Hannes: Hopefully it will still succeed|1
22-10-17 23:24 - Natalia: <Media weggelaten>|1
22-10-17 23:24 - Natalia: Hell yes, I fixed it|1
22-10-17 23:26 - Hannes: Great to hear!!|0
22-10-17 23:26 - Hannes: Looks nice aswell|0
22-10-17 23:26 - Hannes: Great job|0
22-10-17 23:26 - Luke: Looks Nice Natalie !! 👍🏼👍🏼|0
22-10-17 23:31 - Natalia: Thank you guys :)|0
22-10-17 23:39 - Joost: 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼|0
22-10-17 23:55 - Jodi Grooteman: Niceeee|0
23-10-17 09:45 - Hannes: the test area for the casualties is open in 45 minutes, shall i film it and write some stuff down if i have to?|1
23-10-17 09:47 - Joost: Sure! 
Tomorrow we have the end evaluation. I don't really know what we are going to do... do we need to prepare tips and tops for everyone or do we need to prepare the question from the course manual? Does anyone know this 😬|1
23-10-17 09:55 - Hannes: maybe both?|1
23-10-17 09:56 - Natalia: Sounds good Hannes, maybe also ask them when they're open this week and when/if we can come?|1
23-10-17 09:57 - Hannes: For testing the drone?|1
23-10-17 09:57 - Hannes: we needed to ask the course coordinator right?|1
23-10-17 09:58 - Natalia: Yes but he told me to ask the guys from the testing area about the possibility of testing it there|1
23-10-17 09:58 - Natalia: So we do both :)|1
23-10-17 09:58 - Hannes: ah oke i will go in the afternoon|1
23-10-17 10:00 - Natalia: Thanks :)|0
23-10-17 12:05 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
23-10-17 12:05 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
23-10-17 12:12 - Natalia: Nice! Did you talk to them? :)|1
23-10-17 12:14 - Hannes: no he is not available yet since other groups are talking to him|1
23-10-17 12:14 - Hannes: but im making my HWA near the testing area|1
23-10-17 12:14 - Hannes: so i can speak to him later|1
23-10-17 12:16 - Natalia: Oki 👍🏻|0
23-10-17 12:35 - Jodi Grooteman: HWA?|1
23-10-17 12:20 - Hannes: he said that if we could prove that it is safe than we might test it in the testing area|1
23-10-17 12:20 - Hannes: so we must send an e-mail for a safety test|1
23-10-17 12:21 - Hannes: and than if we pass we could use the testing area|1
23-10-17 12:22 - Natalia: Uhm|0
23-10-17 12:22 - Natalia: That's weird|1
23-10-17 12:22 - Hannes: for the closing event it is the same if we dont pass a safety test we can not fly in a place where there are a lot of people if we dont have a safe robot|1
23-10-17 12:22 - Hannes: well i dont think it is that weird haha|1
23-10-17 12:22 - Natalia: Like isn't the point of the testing area to test if it's safe or not?|1
23-10-17 12:23 - Hannes: the propellers have a high velocity and if we dont use it safely|1
23-10-17 12:23 - Hannes: yeah but the testing area is in the hall of gemini|1
23-10-17 12:23 - Hannes: so should we send an e-mail?|1
23-10-17 12:24 - Hannes: for testing the drone|1
23-10-17 12:24 - Natalia: Hm so he suggests we first email that de Lange guy?|1
23-10-17 12:24 - Luke: Hannes did you try the claw on one of the dolls?|1
23-10-17 12:24 - Hannes: no not yet but i thought the dolls were the 3d printed with a lot of loose limbs etc|1
23-10-17 12:24 - Hannes: but they are just regular dolls|1
23-10-17 12:25 - Luke: Aaah okeay|0
23-10-17 12:25 - Hannes: like the doll we have|1
23-10-17 12:25 - Natalia: ?|0
23-10-17 12:25 - Hannes: i will ask the professor|1
23-10-17 12:26 - Natalia: Okay|0
23-10-17 12:36 - Hannes: you have to ask to use them since they are 20 euros per piece|1
23-10-17 12:36 - Hannes: ?|0
23-10-17 12:36 - Hannes: i just say that we worked in groups and what i did|1
23-10-17 12:36 - Hannes: how many shifts i have done|1
23-10-17 12:36 - Hannes: and make an evaluation|1
23-10-17 12:55 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
23-10-17 12:55 - Hannes: He does not look happy|1
23-10-17 12:56 - Joost: He probably wont be happy after all the picking up 😉|1
23-10-17 12:56 - Hannes: But ive tested the claw with it and it is very effective|1
23-10-17 12:56 - Hannes: The head is the main problem|1
23-10-17 12:56 - Hannes: It is just loos in the body|1
23-10-17 12:56 - Luke: Have you a video of it ?|1
23-10-17 12:57 - Hannes: Yess not really that clear since i use the movement plus the camera|1
23-10-17 12:57 - Hannes: <Media weggelaten>|1
23-10-17 12:58 - Luke: Aaah if you position the claws in another way I would probally work better|1
23-10-17 12:59 - Luke: But it looks fine, not perfect but fine|1
23-10-17 12:59 - Luke: He Only loses his head, who cares😂✌🏼|0
23-10-17 13:00 - Hannes: Yeah that!|0
23-10-17 18:04 - Luke: How late do we wanna meet tomorrow?|1
23-10-17 18:04 - Luke: Because I only have time untill 13:00|1
23-10-17 18:10 - Natalia: I have to leave straight after the official meeting|1
23-10-17 18:10 - Luke: Do we wanna meet in the Morning ?|1
23-10-17 18:16 - Roos: I also have another meeting during the break, again|1
23-10-17 18:24 - Jodi Grooteman: I can meet in the morning|1
23-10-17 18:30 - Joost: I can also meet in the morning|1
23-10-17 18:30 - Joost: 10.00|1
23-10-17 18:30 - Joost: ?|1
23-10-17 18:30 - Hannes: Sure|1
23-10-17 18:32 - Luke: I dont think I am going to make it tomorow morning. Just got a message about another deadline.|1
23-10-17 18:32 - Luke: But as a group when do we wanna meet more this week|1
23-10-17 18:33 - Luke: I al able to meet on wendsday, thurstday and maybe friday afternoon.|1
23-10-17 18:33 - Luke: We should at least meet one time with the entire group to finish|1 everything and to make decissions for the final report and the demo. What about thurstday for that ?|1
23-10-17 18:34 - Luke: Besides that I think the all other days at least some of us should meet to work on tasks|1
23-10-17 18:38 - Hannes: Yeah great idea thursdaymorning? I cant in the afternoon|1
23-10-17 18:39 - Luke: That is possible for me|1
23-10-17 18:39 - Natalia: Don't think I can meet tomorrow morning either|1
23-10-17 18:39 - Natalia: But don't you guys think Friday is maybe better for the final meeting?|1
23-10-17 18:40 - Roos: That is also fine with me 😊|1
23-10-17 18:47 - Luke: Friday is also fine for me. I am availble after 13:00 on friday|1
23-10-17 18:48 - Hannes: Yeah afternoon on frifay is also better for me|1
23-10-17 18:49 - Joost: I don't really know how much work we still need to do, but I think we should meet a lot of time this week... so one time isn't enough like Luke said.
In my opinion the final meeting should be on the day that first of all everyone is available and secondly as much as possible is "done".


Since not everyone will be present tomorrow morning maybe we should share our availability with eachother:


I can meet:
Tuesday 08:45-18:15
Wednesday 11:30-16:00
Thursday 10:00-16:00
Friday 10:00-17:30|1
23-10-17 18:51 - Luke: For me :
Wednesday 13:30 - 17:00
Thursday 10:00 - 16:00
Friday 13:00 - 17:00|1
23-10-17 18:51 - Jodi Grooteman: I agree that we should meet as much as possible|1
23-10-17 18:53 - Natalia: I'm not sure about my availability yet, because what's left for me is programming and it's a job that's not very effectively done in a meeting. So I'll see how things go|1
23-10-17 18:53 - Jodi Grooteman: Tuesday the whole day
Wednesday until 13:30
Tursday the whole day
Friday i dont know|1
23-10-17 18:54 - Luke: So Joost and Jodi you already have tomorow together. Maybe start on the poster ect for the demo and try to fill in as much as possible in the report ?|1
23-10-17 18:54 - Luke: Thursday is also a Good day I see, we already are with three then. ✌🏼|1
23-10-17 18:55 - Hannes: Tuesday afternoon
Wednesday morning
Thursday morning
Friday afternoon|1
23-10-17 18:55 - Joost: That's a great suggestion! Jodi and I can work on the poster etc|1
23-10-17 18:56 - Luke: In my opinion we should finish the report thursday so that friday will be all about the presentation and demo ?|1
23-10-17 18:57 - Luke: Natalie if you work at home, please keep us updated so that if you need help we can support|1
23-10-17 18:58 - Luke: En Besides that I think I would be helpfull to at least join us on thursday so that we can all work together on the final parts (drone/report) ?|1
23-10-17 19:00 - Natalia: Yes, I'll let you know tomorrow about the coding part. Need to start it to see the difficulty level|1
23-10-17 19:02 - Luke: I understand 👍🏼|1
23-10-17 19:02 - Hannes: Who is chairman?|1
23-10-17 19:02 - Luke: Dont know, not me|1
23-10-17 19:02 - Joost: Jodi|1
23-10-17 19:04 - Jodi Grooteman: Yes i am|1
23-10-17 19:04 - Luke: How late and Where is the actual meeting tomorrow?|1
23-10-17 19:04 - Jodi Grooteman: 11:45|1

23-10-17 19:18 - Roos: Do we also need a poster at the final presentation?|1
23-10-17 19:25 - Joost: <Media weggelaten>|1
23-10-17 19:38 - Roos: They only say that we need an informal presentation and a paper with pictures of the drone, but nothing about a poster 🙈|1
24-10-17 09:43 - Hannes: Where do we meet at 10?|1
24-10-17 09:46 - Joost: I will be 15 minutes topo late|1
24-10-17 09:51 - Jodi Grooteman: Vertigo?|1
24-10-17 09:53 - Roos: Did I miss something, I did not know that we wanted to meet at ten? So I am not prepared for that|1
24-10-17 10:03 - Joost: 👆🏼|0
24-10-17 10:06 - Jodi Grooteman: Hannes and i are at vertigo 4|1
24-10-17 10:07 - Joost: I will be there in 5 minutes|1
24-10-17 10:19 - Roos: Owhh well that was mentioned very quick as a question, but I can come earlier only not sure how much earlier I can be there|1
24-10-17 14:05 - Roos: Sorry, I have to do some other things for my committee now which I did not expect|1
24-10-17 21:48 - Roos: Heey! Did you decide anything about when and where we are going to meet this week? Because I also have to learn for my other exams this week and do some other things and I would like to make a planning for doing all these things|1
24-10-17 21:50 - Luke: We are going to meet on thursday Morning and friday afternoon|1
24-10-17 21:55 - Roos: Okay thanks|1
24-10-17 22:43 - Joost: Can you join both of these moments?|1
25-10-17 07:16 - Roos: Yes|1
25-10-17 10:21 - Luke: What time do we wanna meet tomorrow ?|1
25-10-17 12:49 - Natalia: I've solved yesterday's beeping problem|1
25-10-17 12:49 - Natalia: And now I have an entirely new one|1
25-10-17 12:50 - Hannes: ah whats wrong?|1
25-10-17 12:50 - Hannes: good job on the first problem though|1
25-10-17 12:50 - Natalia: Basically the motors kinda want to start all together but they start pretty randomly, either 3 of them or 2 of them together and I hear a beating sound|1
25-10-17 12:51 - Natalia: I'm guessing we are having issues with the motor attachment to the arm|1
25-10-17 12:51 - Natalia: And the beating sound might be the screws touching the parts of the motors|1
25-10-17 12:54 - Natalia: And in general too much vibration on these connections and the motors react funky|1
25-10-17 12:54 - Natalia: At least that's what people say is a possible reason|1
25-10-17 12:54 - Hannes: ah oke glad they responded on forums|1
25-10-17 12:55 - Hannes: uhm we could try to unscrew them a bit|1
25-10-17 12:56 - Hannes: or if that does not work maybe make a new connection to the frame?|1
25-10-17 12:56 - Natalia: Yes something like that I guess|1
25-10-17 12:57 - Natalia: I'll try to see if I can improve it in any way through programming but if it's not gonna help then I guess vibration is the reason|1
25-10-17 12:57 - Natalia: And we can try to fix it tomorrow, cause I won't go into that alone :)|1
25-10-17 12:58 - Hannes: yeah indeed|1
25-10-17 13:19 - Natalia: Ok I fixed it 😄|1
25-10-17 13:21 - Luke: Nice !!!|0
25-10-17 13:21 - Luke: Can you show something ?|1
25-10-17 13:22 - Natalia: <Media weggelaten>|1
25-10-17 13:22 - Natalia: Here you go :)|0
25-10-17 13:24 - Hannes: Great!|0
25-10-17 13:25 - Luke: Wooow looks Good !!|0
25-10-17 13:26 - Joost: Natalia is our superhero 👩🏻‍🔧|0
25-10-17 13:26 - Luke: Yeah she is!|0
25-10-17 13:26 - Luke: Wonderwoman! 🙌🏽🤘🏽|0
25-10-17 13:27 - Natalia: Haha thanks thanks 🙈😄|0
25-10-17 13:31 - Hannes: We can go into testing phase 😇|1
25-10-17 13:31 - Hannes: Should we sent an email?|1
25-10-17 13:32 - Luke: Well I dont think it is programmed jet or is it @31623773620 ?|1
25-10-17 13:35 - Natalia: Let's see about that tomorrow|1
25-10-17 13:35 - Natalia: Cause indeed it's not programmed yet|1
25-10-17 13:35 - Natalia: Still needs a flight controller, tuning the gyro and stuff like that :)|1
25-10-17 13:39 - Hannes: Ahh oke|1
25-10-17 17:36 - Luke: But from how late untill how late do we meet ?|1
25-10-17 17:38 - Luke: Because if we dont meet untill to late I would like to go to dutch design week|1
25-10-17 17:38 - Luke: But if we need to meet longer I will stag offcourse|1
25-10-17 17:38 - Joost: Natalia said the eraliest she will be there is at 10.30|1
25-10-17 17:38 - Joost: So maybe 10.30 is good?|1
25-10-17 17:39 - Luke: Okeay|0
25-10-17 17:39 - Luke: And till How late will we meet ?|1
25-10-17 17:40 - Luke: Beause I need to make a reservation for the ddw to get a place at the event|1
25-10-17 17:42 - Joost: I think till 13.30|1
25-10-17 17:42 - Luke: Okeay that would be nice for me|1
25-10-17 17:47 - Natalia: Yes 10:30 is good for me :)|1
25-10-17 17:54 - Hannes: Same|1
25-10-17 17:56 - Jodi Grooteman: For me too|1
25-10-17 18:03 - Roos: Same for me too|1
25-10-17 18:06 - Joost: I have done some major work on the report. Still a lot needs to be done, but I think we can manage to do it. I already discussed this with Hannes and Jodi, but using words like "you" and "we" is not professional. Moreover sentences with opinions are also not professional: For example saying it is easy, or beautiful.
I think all parts of text are now checked and corrected, besides the parts that we still have to discuss on, if we want those in the report. Moreover I would like to say that almost all HWA's consisted of informal usage of text, so copying text in the report will ruine the professionality of our report. So make sure the text is changer!


I know this information is not for everyone but I still wanted to state this to prevent this from happening anymore.|1
25-10-17 19:15 - Natalia: <Media weggelaten>|1
25-10-17 19:15 - Natalia: The vibrations are crazy high|1
25-10-17 19:16 - Natalia: At least 3 times as much as needed measured by the test code|1
25-10-17 19:18 - Natalia: On about 40% throttle, higher would be even worse|1
25-10-17 19:18 - Luke: What do you mean with that ?|1
25-10-17 19:19 - Natalia: I mean the vibration is too high for a safe flight|1
25-10-17 19:20 - Luke: Oow Okeay|0
25-10-17 19:20 - Natalia: Motors apparently not mounted stable enough|1
25-10-17 19:20 - Natalia: :(|0
25-10-17 19:20 - Luke: You could already expect that|1
25-10-17 19:20 - Luke: Yeah we|0
25-10-17 19:22 - Natalia: Yeah but now that I've turned it on with the prop on and run the tests I'm properly scared by this machine 😄|1
25-10-17 19:23 - Natalia: I didn't dare to turn the throttle higher than 50% cause it feels like it would break off and kill me 😄|1
25-10-17 19:26 - Hannes: Haha yeah i get that we needed to have a safe test for the drone|1
25-10-17 19:28 - Natalia: Yes and what I just did was the minimum safety test. Got the vibration level of like 160 when it should be 40-50 :(|1
25-10-17 19:32 - Luke: Hahahaha sick|0
25-10-17 19:35 - Natalia: Project status: we can fly now, but maybe we shouldn't 😄|1
25-10-17 19:35 - Hannes: Haha well we still "can" 😇|1
25-10-17 19:36 - Hannes: Still think that is a great accomplishment for this project|1
25-10-17 19:36 - Luke: Yeah I Agree|1
25-10-17 19:37 - Luke: Again well done Natalie !|0
25-10-17 19:37 - Luke: Now we can simply say that the only reason we fail is because the moters are not attached strong enough|1
25-10-17 19:38 - Luke: But in theory the drone works|1
25-10-17 19:40 - Natalia: Haha thanks :) we can still try it tomorrow, but we better do it somewhere in a very open field :)|1
25-10-17 19:41 - Luke: Hahahaha|0
25-10-17 19:42 - Natalia: I'm serious :P|0
25-10-17 19:43 - Luke: Yeah I understand|0
25-10-17 19:48 - Hannes: We still have the metal wires so we can maybe attach it to the ground or something|1
25-10-17 19:49 - Natalia: Yes, something like that|1
25-10-17 19:51 - Hannes: Or to a bag with a few books|1
25-10-17 19:51 - Hannes: Or i would be suprised if it could lift 10 kg extra 😂|1
25-10-17 19:52 - Luke: Hahahaha|0
25-10-17 19:52 - Hannes: Haha that would be a weird story to the tue student desk|1
25-10-17 19:52 - Natalia: Hahaha awesome|0
25-10-17 19:52 - Hannes: Im sorry i lost my bags with books to a selfmade drone from engineering design|1
25-10-17 19:53 - Natalia: But maybe try a bag of old papers that you always wanted to put in a shredder|1
25-10-17 19:53 - Natalia: :D|0
25-10-17 19:53 - Hannes: Like course manuals of this course?|0
25-10-17 19:53 - Hannes: Or the use basic books 😂|0
25-10-17 19:54 - Natalia: Use basic hell yes 😂|0
25-10-17 19:55 - Hannes: Haha well we have 10 books than if everybody is there|1
25-10-17 19:56 - Natalia: Too bad I always used pdfs 😥|0
25-10-17 19:57 - Natalia: Also these props create so much wind|1
25-10-17 19:58 - Natalia: I think we can rescue the casualties by blowing them out of the disaster area|1
25-10-17 19:59 - Hannes: Haha|0
26-10-17 08:56 - Natalia: I'll be 10:30 at the station, so 10:45 at uni|1

26-10-17 15:48 - Joost: Since Natalia has paid for a new arduino, I think we all should give her 13 euro (which is a sixth of 78 euros|1
26-10-17 16:01 - Roos: Wow it is working, well done!!!! 👍|1
26-10-17 16:04 - Natalia: Thank you, Joost, I'd appreciate it :)|1

Photo Mantis Claw
Weight Styrofoam rings
Length wooden platforms
Volume new frame
Calculate weight frame
Dxf file picture of second plate


A part needs to be written down about "test landing mechanisms" which will be about the fact that we tried the T-shape and we considered it not stable enough|1
27-10-17 12:31 - Joost: The first things needs to be implemented in the text shortly
The last thing needs some text|1
27-10-17 12:33 - Natalia: Guys, just a little note, if you're planning to reattach the parts in a different way, please do it in some non-permanent way cause after the presentation I plan to replace the arduino (to yun) and remove the receiver :)|1
27-10-17 12:35 - Luke: 👍🏼|0
27-10-17 12:36 - Joost: For the list:
Implementing some text about the drone test (yesterday)|1

27-10-17 20:03 - Jodi Grooteman: The references are not done yet|1
27-10-17 20:03 - Hannes: Good job!|0
27-10-17 20:03 - Jodi Grooteman: For that i need links and these are not in the documents|1
27-10-17 20:03 - Jodi Grooteman: So I dont know how to find them|1
27-10-17 20:05 - Hannes: Hmm than just skip them i think|1
27-10-17 21:50 - Natalia: Guys how is everything going? I've looked at the report and the section about building the electronics is still missing?|1
27-10-17 21:51 - Roos: I just checked the lay-out and uploaded a new version|1
27-10-17 21:52 - Roos: However, I did not make any big charges in the text itself|1
27-10-17 21:54 - Natalia: I'm a little confused here. The assembly section is literally empty?|1
27-10-17 22:23 - Roos: I forgot the references, so I uploaded a new one haha|1
27-10-17 22:25 - Roos: I think that was because we did not had any idea of what was actually done with the electronics|1
27-10-17 22:32 - Natalia: Ok can other people who wrote the report reply too? Cause seriously, what is that? I said I'd be missing today cause I'm preparing for an exam and I won't be writing anything for the report. I thought the document would be ready by tonight with everything in it and at least filled with stuff copied from my hwa?|1
27-10-17 22:33 - Natalia: Otherwise you decide that you don't know anything and you didn't ask me anything about it, why? Just wanna leave the major part of the report empty?|1
27-10-17 22:46 - Luke: As far as I knew Joost said everything was finished ?|1
27-10-17 22:54 - Joost: No unfortunately it isnt. Im sorry that i did not saw some things|1
27-10-17 22:55 - Luke: But the assembly is like a real big part right ? :p|1
27-10-17 22:57 - Joost: So Im responsible for nobody checking the report, while I did hours of extra work on the report?|1
27-10-17 22:59 - Luke: Im not saying you are responsible but 3 of you were working on the report today and I at the end I asked if everything was done and everyone said that the only thing left to do was edititng the report :p|1
27-10-17 23:00 - Natalia: That's exactly what I don't understand either. How I ended up finding all the missing things by accident late at night while everyone else was supposed to be working on that thing (not just Joost)?|1
27-10-17 23:03 - Luke: Well Hannes and I are meating tonorrow at 12 to prepare the presentation. Who can join us to finish that part of the report ?|1
27-10-17 23:04 - Luke: I really dont understand Why that part is not filled in. Because one of my hwa is lierallt a step by step plan of How I assemble the frame.|1
27-10-17 23:04 - Luke: Literally|1
27-10-17 23:07 - Natalia: Exactly. And mine is all about electronics and I literally said I'll explain anything people don't understand, just ask. But nobody asked me about anything|1
27-10-17 23:08 - Natalia: I don't know if I can come at 12, maybe 13|1
27-10-17 23:09 - Natalia: But I'm just really astounded by this situation|1
27-10-17 23:09 - Joost: The assembly of the frame is in the realization|1
27-10-17 23:09 - Joost: Since the Course Manual, the report template and the rubrics contradict eachother|1
27-10-17 23:11 - Luke: Hmm Okeay|0
27-10-17 23:12 - Luke: But how are we going to fix this?|1
27-10-17 23:12 - Luke: I am at the tue tonorrow from 12:00 and I can stay untill around 17:00max|1
27-10-17 23:13 - Joost: Im working on it right now|1
27-10-17 23:13 - Luke: So in the morning I first have to prepare for the presentation with Hannes, if we have time left we can help in the report.|1
27-10-17 23:13 - Joost: Im getting very annoyed by the numbering of figures and tables|1
27-10-17 23:13 - Luke: In the afternoon I can work on the report as well untill 17:00|1
27-10-17 23:28 - Joost: Can everyone who has made photos of the design send them to me|1
27-10-17 23:54 - Joost: anyone a picture of the ROD that we will use tomorrow?|1
27-10-17 23:58 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
27-10-17 23:58 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
27-10-17 23:58 - Luke: <Media weggelaten>|1
28-10-17 10:44 - Joost: I've done a lot of work on the report|1
28-10-17 10:44 - Joost: Now someone else can do the rest|1
28-10-17 10:44 - Joost: Make sure to download the version: Group 200 Report 10.41|1
28-10-17 11:26 - Luke: @31636488574 @31619244912  can you guys work on the report today? Because I and Hannes are doing the presentation and Joost and Natalie already did a lot ?|1
28-10-17 11:28 - Joost: And how late are we going to meet at the university?|1
28-10-17 11:29 - Natalia: No apparently, Luke, it's me who's going to be finishing the report because I already wrote the whole programming section last night and the electronic section is still insufficient, so I guess it's me who is going to write it cause no one else gives a damn|1
28-10-17 11:29 - Luke: I and Hannes are at the tue at 12:00|1
28-10-17 11:30 - Joost: I did give a damn
That's why a was working till after 00.00|1
28-10-17 11:30 - Luke: Roos and Jodi I really aspect you two to join working on the report, mainly Because the report was your part the last 8 weeks and apparently it isnt done correct|1
28-10-17 11:32 - Natalia: Yeah, I understand Joost, and I also worked till 2 am, but actually all of this should have been done way before and by participation of other people|1
28-10-17 11:32 - Joost: I agree on that|1
28-10-17 11:34 - Luke: Roos Jodi can you reply and join at vertigo earlier today ?|1
28-10-17 11:34 - Luke: Because the report has to be sufficiënt because it will be a major part of our grade|1
28-10-17 11:41 - Natalia: I don't have an office license atm, so I'm gonna write some things in google docs, someone else please copy it in the word doc afterwards|1
28-10-17 11:41 - Luke: Can you mark the parts you wrote or are you going to make it in a seperate document?|1
28-10-17 11:42 - Natalia: In a separate is better I think|1
28-10-17 11:42 - Luke: Okeay|0
28-10-17 11:42 - Luke: Inform me when you finished it|1
28-10-17 11:42 - Natalia: Ok|0
28-10-17 11:42 - Luke: Then we can paste it in the finale report|1
28-10-17 12:04 - Jodi Grooteman: I can be at the uni at 12:45 to work on it|1
28-10-17 12:05 - Jodi Grooteman: But i dont think i ever do it good enough|1
28-10-17 12:05 - Luke: Great Jodi. We are at 4th Floor.|1

28-10-17 12:06 - Jodi Grooteman: Okay, then i will come|1
28-10-17 12:07 - Luke: We just have to put in some more time. I am also not good in making a report so I dont blame anyone. At least it is nice that you have some time to work on it👍🏼|1
28-10-17 12:19 - Roos: I could also come some time earlier, but I am not sure whether that is very useful as I do not have the idea that I can do anything right, especially not since last Tuesday|1
28-10-17 12:27 - Jodi Grooteman: Im coming now|1
28-10-17 12:38 - Luke: We all have points that we could improve for future projects. At the moment it is most important to work together this last day to finish the report as good as possible.|1
28-10-17 12:39 - Luke: So every help is welcome|1
28-10-17 12:39 - Hannes: yess i agree on this|1
28-10-17 12:39 - Hannes: im not here to argue anything, just saying every help is welcome and we should not let the work go to a few people|1
